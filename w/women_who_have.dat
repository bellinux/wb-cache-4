40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} are prescribed drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and 561 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %).

Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> had sex with both men and <b>women</b> and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both having {{had sex with a}} man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these <b>women,</b> 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> had sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. RESULTS: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors.

5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWomen <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had preeclampsia {{demonstrate}} higher {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS), impaired vascular function, and increased sympathetic activity and are {{at increased risk}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of 12 weeks of exercise training (70 - 80 % maximum volume of oxygen utilization) in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia on physical fitness, components of MetS, vasculature, and autonomic functions compared with healthy control subjects. Study DesignOur prospective case-control study included 24 normotensive <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and 20 control subjects who were matched for age and postpartum interval (all 6 - 12 months after delivery). Before and after training, we measured all components of MetS (ie, BP, lipids, glucose/insulin, and albuminuria), carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial and superficial femoral artery endothelial function that used flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Autonomic activity was quantified with power spectral analysis (low-frequency/high-frequency power [LF/HF] ratio). ResultsAt baseline, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia demonstrated higher values of most components of MetS. Compared with the control subjects, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia had increased IMT (580 ± 92 μm vs 477 ± 65 μm, respectively), impaired endothelial function (FMD brachial artery, 5. 3 % ± 2. 2 % vs 10. 8 % ± 3. 5 %, respectively; FMD superficial femoral artery, 4. 9 % ± 2. 1 % vs 8. 7 % ± 3. 2 %, respectively) and increased LF/HF power ratio (2. 2 ± 1. 0 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 4, respectively; all P <. 05). In both groups, exercise training decreased values of most components of MetS and IMT, improved FMD, and concurrently reduced LF/HF. Despite these improvements, vascular and autonomic variables did not normalize by 12 weeks of training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that exercise training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and control subjects improves components of MetS, endothelial function, vascular wall thickness, and autonomic control. Nonetheless, trained <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia only reached a cardiovascular status that is comparable with sedentary healthy control subjects...|$|R

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels.

According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy.

She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple.

5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E
