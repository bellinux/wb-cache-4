40|$|The {{introduction}} of side chains in π-conjugated molecules is a design strategy widely exploited to increase molecular solubility thus improving the processability, while directly influencing the self-assembly and consequently the electrical properties of thin films. Here, a multiscale structural analysis performed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, and {{atomic force microscopy}} on thin films of dicyanoperylene molecules decorated with either linear or branched side chains is reported. The substitution with asymmetric branched alkyl chains allows obtaining, upon thermal annealing, field-effect transistors with enhanced transport properties with respect to linear alkyl chains. Branched chains induce molecular disorder during the film growth from solution, effectively favouring 2 D morphology. Post-deposition thermal annealing leads to a structural transition towards the bulk-phase for molecules <b>with</b> <b>branched</b> <b>chains,</b> still preserving the 2 D morphology and allowing efficient charge transport between crystalline domains. Conversely, molecules with linear chains self-assemble into 3 D islands exhibiting the bulk-phase structure. Upon thermal annealing, these 3 D islands keep their size constant and no major changes are observed in the organic field effect transistor characteristics. These findings demonstrate that the disorder generated by the asymmetric branched chains when the molecule is physisorbed in thin film can be instrumental for enhancing charge transport via thermal annealing...|$|E
40|$|The bond {{fluctuation}} {{model with}} a bond potential {{has been applied to}} investigation of the glass transition of linear chains and chains with a regular disposition of small branches. Cooling and subsequent heating curves are obtained for the chain energies and also for the mean acceptance probability of a bead jump. In order to mimic different trends to vitrification, a factor B gauging the strength of the bond potential with respect to the long-range potential (i. e. the intramolecular or intermolecular potential between indirectly bonded beads) has been introduced. (A higher value of B leads to a preference for the highest bond lengths and a higher total energy, implying a greater tendency to vitrify.) Different cases have been considered for linear chains: no long-range potential, no bond potential and several choices for B. Furthermore, we have considered two distinct values of B for alternate bonds in linear chains. In the case of the branched chains, molecules with different values of B for bonds in the main chain and in the branches have also been investigated. The possible presence of crystallization has been characterized by calculating the collective light scattering function of the different samples after annealing at a convenient temperature below the onset of crystallization. It is concluded that crystallization is inherited more efficiently in the systems <b>with</b> <b>branched</b> <b>chains</b> and also for higher values of B. The branched molecules with the highest B values in the main chain bonds exhibit two distinct transitions in the heating curves which may be associated with two glass transitions.

By further functionalization of these PEGylated SWCNTs with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide, the accumulation in integrin-positive U 87 MG tumors was significantly improved from approximately 3 % to 4 % to approximately 10 % to 15 % of the total injected dose (ID)/g, owing to the specific RGD-integrin avb 3 recognition. Raman signatures of SWCNTs were further used to directly probe the presence of CNTs in mice tissues and confirmed the radiolabel-based results [55]. In another experiment to evaluate the influences of PEG chain lengths on cellular uptake of PEGylated SWCNTs, it has been found that adsorbing shorter chain PEG (PL-PEG- 2000) to SWCNTs was incapable of protecting CNTs from macrophagocytosis both in vitro and in vivo, while adsorbing longer chain PEG (PL-PEG- 5000) effectively reduced their nonspecific uptake of CNTs in vivo[56]. Functionalization of SWCNTs with PEG grafted branched polymers, namely poly(maleicanhydride-alt- 1 -octadecene)-PEG methyl ethers (PMHC 18 -mPEG) and poly (g-glutamic acid)-pyrine(30 %)-PEG methylethers (70 %) (gPGA-Py-mPEG), the blood circulation time was remarkably prolonged (half-life of 22.1 h for gPGA-Py-mPEG and 18.9 h for MHC 18 -mPEG) after intravenous injection into mice [57]. Further research reveals that the tumor accumulation of PEG-SWCNTs was 8 % ID/g and 9 % ID/g of the intravenously administered doses in EMF 6 model (breast cancer in BABL/c mice) and the Lewis model (lung cancer in C 57 BL mice), respectively. SWCNTs covalently modified with PEG showed longer half-life in blood circulation in comparison with those noncovalently modified with PEG of similar chain lengths. SWCNTs covalently conjugated <b>with</b> <b>branched</b> <b>chains</b> of 7 -kDa PEG effectively increased the half-life of SWCNTs up to 1 day, which is the longest among all of the tested PEGs. And this length chain PEG-modified SWCNTs had near-complete clearance from the main organs in approximately 2 months. There seemed to be a length limits in the relations between PEG chain lengths and their effects to increase the blood circulation time. Further increase in molecular weight from 7 to 12 kDa had no influence on the blood circulation time and RES uptake [58].|$|E

40|$|The ETF (electron {{transfer}} flavoprotein) and ETFDH (ETF dehydrogenase) are flavoproteins {{involved in}} electron transfer from primary acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to ubiquinone of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS). ETF is a heterodimer composed of subunits ETFα and ETFβand ETFDH is associated to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Electron-donor metabolic reactions in which primary acyl-CoA dehydrogenases {{are known to}} catalyze reactions are β-oxidation, amino acid catabolism, choline catabolism and sarcosine and dimethylglycine catabolism. In mammalian cells, β-oxidation takes place in both mitochondria and peroxisomes, depending on fatty acid length and double bonds. For other eukaryotic organisms, it is exclusively peroxisomal and, hence, not directly coupled to ATP generation. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologues of ETF and ETFDH are encoded by YPR 004 c (ETFα), YGR 207 c (ETFβ) and YOR 356 w (ETFDH) and have been demonstrated to be mitochondrial proteins. In this work, we aim at elucidate the role of ETF and ETFDH in yeast by exploring the possibility {{of involvement in the}} catabolism of amino acids, choline, sarcosine and dimethylglycine; in oxidative stress; and in heat shock. Mutant strains affected in these genes were tested for growth on media with different carbon sources. All mutant strains displayed normal growth when compared with their parental on glucose and on non-fermentable carbon sources: ethanol, glycerol, succinate, malate, pyruvate and lactate. Growth on palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid acid with 16 carbons, was unaffected by these mutations as well. However, when the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (18 : 1 cis- 9) was used as sole carbon and energy source, the mutant strains showed growth deficiency. Considering that beta-oxidation in yeasts is exclusively peroxisomal, this unexpected result suggests an involvement of ETF and ETFDH on metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids. This implication will be further investigated by testing other fatty acids with more double bonds and <b>with</b> <b>branched</b> <b>chains</b> to explore possible alternative catabolic reactions that might occur in the mitochondrion. Furthermore, the involvement in catabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds (amino acids, choline, sarcosine and dimethylglycine) will be assayed as well.

However, soymilk and soy products are commonly characterised by a beany off-flavour leading to low-consumer acceptability in Western cultures. The {{aims of the}} cUJ:rent study are to reduce the main off-flavour, such as hexanal, by preparing soymilk freshly with control processing steps and investigating lactic acid bacteria to explor~the reduction of hexanal and enhance desirable volatile compounds in soymilk. Soybeans soaked in NaHC 03 had an appearance and colour of soymilk better than the unsoaked soybeans. In addition, soymilk from soybeans soaked in purified water, dehulled soybeans, and boiled in NaHC 03 for 10 min, produced good qualities in total solids, and whiter than soymilk boiled for 30 min. The chosen procedure {{for the production of}} the soymilk, a blended (for 2 min) soybean milk was mixed by mixer emulsifier at 8000 rev min-I for 5 min, homogenized at 200 kg sq cm-I and finally separated the milk with centrifugation at 169 x g for 5 min. This soymilk was rich in total solids content (77. 8 g kg-I). Soy yogl:mrt has a weak viscoelastic behaviour. The optimised ratio of soybeans: water (1 : 5) was used to prepare soy yoghurt. The aroma profiles ofsoymilk were identified by GC-MS analysis. The main volatile compound in soymilk was hexanal. Other volatiles present in high amounts were 1 -octen- 3 - 01, 1 -hexanol, pentanal, 2 -pentyl furan and 1 -pentanol. Selected Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei mixture produced acetaldehyde, diacetyl andacetoin and also reduced hexanal. The survival in soy yoghurt ofLact. casei was better than that ofLact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus during 48 h of incubation. Strep. thermophilus preferred to utIlIze sucrose to glucose whIle Lact. casei utilized glucose. Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei did not reduce stachyose and raffinose. Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei in single or mixture culture reduced hexanal to hexanol, and the hexanol was further reduced during the 24 h of the fermentation. The reduction ofhexanal to hexanol in soy yoghurt is desirable because hexanol has a weaker flavour than hexanal. Soy yoghurt fermented by mixed cultures ofStrep. thermophilus and Lact. casei had characteristics of yoghurt with a good curd and a pH of 4. 5 - 5. 6. Strep. f' thermophilus grew rapidly during the first 6 h, and then grew slowly during the next 18 h of incubation. Lact. casei grew continually during 24 h of incubation. Soy yoghurt fennented by mixed cultures contained desirable aroma compounds, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, 2, 3 -pentanedione and acetoin. The soy yoghurts from soymilks with added glucose or sucrose had increased levels ofpyruvate, 2, 3 - pentanedione and diacetyl, suggesting that sugars contribute to the production of these products. The amino acids, methionine and threonine, did not contribute to the production of acetaldehyde in yoghurt but promoted ethanol fonnation. The microstructure of soy yoghurt was studied by scanning electron microscope.

First, correct temporal expression of both brlA transcripts (brlAα and brlAβ) requires MedAp. Second, MedAp functions as a coactivator required for normal levels of abaA expression.

One extra copy of brlA suppresses medA mutations and restores normal abaA mRNA abundance. In contrast, an extra copy of stuA in a medA(-) strain results in an enhanced medusoid phenotype with extensive metulae proliferation and nearly complete absence of conidia. abaA and brlAα transcription are completely repressed in these strains.

The branching induces higher steric hindrance during electropolymerization, which reduces the mean polymer backbone length, decreases the polymer electrical conductivity and changes the surface morphology. Here, we show that these changes can be beneficial in the case of super-liquid repellent properties. Indeed, superhydrophobic properties are obtained <b>with</b> linear and <b>branched</b> perfluorocarbon <b>chains.</b> However, while superoleophilic properties are obtained with both linear perfluorocarbon chains, much higher oleophobic properties are obtained <b>with</b> <b>branched</b> perfluorocarbon <b>chains.</b> Here, the differences are due to changes in the surface morphology and roughness. This work open new strategies to obtain surfaces with high hydrophobicity and oleophobicity...|$|R

The stems are light green and are strongly tuberculate, with tubercles (small, wart-like projections on the stems) measuring 6 to 9 mm. Together, the plants form fantastic looking forests that may range over many hectares.|$|R
