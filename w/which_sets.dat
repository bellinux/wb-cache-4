5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> the language apart.|$|E
5|$|Books and scripts {{that use}} the general story line of Austen's novels but change or {{otherwise}} modernise the story also became popular {{at the end of}} the 20th century. Clueless (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of Emma that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both Pride and Prejudice and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production Bride and Prejudice, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.|$|E

Released in July 2003, the mod was hosted on established sites, such as GameSpot and CNET, {{as part of their}} FreeSpace 2 contents.|$|E
5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> of k {{integers}} {{have the}} property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E

Tucker assists Erickson with the test, but is brushed aside when he seeks {{to learn more about the}} technology. Following a successful trial-run, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> a new record for the longest transport ever conducted, Tucker confides in Archer that many of the upgrades and modifications to the ship's power systems were not necessary for the test.|$|E

5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the museums}} have been {{accredited}} by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> {{national standards for}} museums in the UK. Several are art galleries providing space for the exhibition of art, or are philatelic, regimental, science, aviation, transport, railway, toy, religious or sports museums, but the majority are local museums. There are also several historic house museums owned or managed by the National Trust or English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white. The White Stripes have cited the minimalist and deconstructionist aspects of De Stijl design {{as a source of}} inspiration for their own musical image and presentation. The album was dedicated to furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld of the De Stijl movement, {{as well as to the}} influential Georgia bluesman Blind Willie McTell.|$|E

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|After {{school is}} over, Yumi's classmate Tsutako Takeshima meets with Yumi {{to show her}} that she took a {{photograph}} of Yumi's meeting with Sachiko earlier that morning. Yumi asks if she can have the photo, but Tsutako says she will give her the snapshot under two conditions: one being that Tsutako can display it at the upcoming school festival, and two being that Yumi get Sachiko's permission to do so as well. Yumi agrees to this, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> in motion {{a series of events}} involving the entire Yamayuri Council. A few weeks after first meeting Sachiko, Yumi accepts Sachiko's rosary and therefore agrees to become her petite sœur. This officially inducts Yumi into the Yamayuri Council where she assists them in school matters alongside Yoshino Shimazu and Shimako Tōdō—the petite sœurs of Rei Hasekura and Sei Satō, respectively. Through her activities in the Yamayuri Council, Yumi becomes closer to the other members and generally finds her experiences with the group to be enjoyable.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} season premiere, filming {{of the show}} moved from Desilu Cahuenga, in Hollywood, California, to CBS Studio Center, in Studio City, Los Angeles, California. Tom Azzari worked as set {{designer}} during season two; he often re-used sets from the first season, because Castle Rock Entertainment had rented a large storage facility in <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> were stored, to save money. Although the scenes in Monk's Cafe were filmed at CBS Studio Center, the exterior of Tom's Restaurant, a diner {{at the intersection of}} Broadway and 112th Street in Manhattan, was used as the exterior for the cafe. The second season of Seinfeld was supposed to start airing on January 16, 1991, but the premiere was postponed one week because of the commencement of the first Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|Susan, a {{divorced}} mother, takes interest in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has {{recently moved to}} Wisteria Lane; however, she faces competition with neighbor Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), a promiscuous serial divorcée. Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup. Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the man with whom Edie was fornicating. Meanwhile, Lynette, a former career woman, is frustrated with raising four young children while her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), is constantly away on business.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade {{route to the}} Euphrates, which was cut {{because of the war}} with Persia; This theory ignores the fact that the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition. The date of the campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius' death, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> it in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus' account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in August). The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|For {{southern}} sea otters to {{be considered}} for removal from threatened species listing, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005–2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now Pigeon Point) and southern limits of the sea otter's range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau. However, the population increased markedly from 2015–2016, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the threshold for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Assuming the population maintains positive trends, ESA delisting is inevitable, although southern sea otters would still be fully protected by state regulations and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, <b>which</b> <b>sets</b> a higher threshold for protection, subjectively at about 8,400 individuals.|$|E
