Club Reviewer Keith Phipps notes: [...] "One {{of the other}} Clios went to Byrrh, a <b>wine-based</b> <b>aperitif</b> whose failure to catch fire in America illustrates that even great advertising can’t sell something people don’t want." ...|$|E
5000|$|Byrrh is an aromatised <b>wine-based</b> <b>apéritif</b> made of red wine, mistelle, and quinine. Created in 1866 and a {{trademark}} since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and {{reputation as a}} [...] "hygienic drink", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to [...] "beer", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions.|$|E

It is a {{blend of}} 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Rosé, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15% {{macerated}} liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing fining, racking, filtering etc.).|$|E
