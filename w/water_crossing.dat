25|$|Plans {{to employ}} assault boats over the Sloe Channel were thwarted by muddy {{conditions}} unsuitable for water craft. The Calgary Highlanders {{had been selected}} for this amphibious operation, as they had received stormboat training in the UK in anticipation of an opposed <b>water</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Seine River, which invasion planners had predicted would be necessary approximately 90 days after the landings in Normandy. In the event, the ground was too boggy to employ the boats, and the Highlanders were utilized as conventional infantry in a landward attack directly over the causeway.|$|E
25|$|As the Rajputs {{reached the}} middle of the creek, the Portuguese on Diu opened fire with two medium and two light machine-guns, {{capsizing}} some of the rafts. Major Mal Singh of the Indian Army along with five men pressed on his advance and crossed the creek. On reaching the far bank, he and his men assaulted the light machine gun trenches at Fort-De-Cova and silenced them. The Portuguese medium machine gun fire from another position wounded the officer and two of his men. However, with the efforts of company Havildar Major Mohan Singh and two other men, the three wounded were evacuated back across the creek to safety. As dawn approached, the Portuguese increased the intensity of fire and the battalion's <b>water</b> <b>crossing</b> equipment suffered extensive damage. As a result, the Indian battalion was ordered to fall back to Kob village by first light.|$|E

25|$|According to the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21March and mid-July around 27PBq of caesium-137 {{entered the}} ocean, about 82percent before 8April. This {{emission}} represents {{the most important}} individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast {{has one of the}} world's strongest currents (Kuroshio Current). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface <b>water</b> <b>crossing</b> contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast. Migratory pelagic species are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean. Elevated levels of caesium-134 appeared in migratory species off the coast of California that were not seen pre-Fukushima.|$|E
500|$|The {{settlement}} of Clackline {{began as a}} stopping point on the Spencers Brook to Northam section of the Eastern Railway line, which opened on 13 October 1886. It was also {{the point where the}} road to Newcastle (now Toodyay) departed the Perth to Kalgoorlie road. Both the road and railway crossed the adjacent Clackline Brook. In 1926, the newly formed Main Roads Department's Engineer for Roads and Bridges, A. Fotheringham, described the majority of the Wooroloo to Clackline road as [...] "simply a bush track widened out from time to time by the traffic". The road crossed the railway line twice, and Clackline Brook via a small bedlog bridge, {{in the vicinity of the}} town, but the rail crossings were [...] "awkwardly and dangerously situated in regard to road traffic, owing to limited visibility", and the <b>water</b> <b>crossing</b> was described in 1935 as [...] "a primitive and inadequate culvert".|$|E
500|$|Clackline Bridge is a {{road bridge}} in Clackline, Western Australia, [...] east of Perth in the Shire of Northam, {{that carried the}} Great Eastern Highway until 2008. It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a {{waterway}} and railway, the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment. The mainly timber bridge has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and {{the route of the}} former railway. The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary <b>water</b> <b>crossing.</b> Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by [...] in 1959–60, but remained a safety hazard, with increasing severity and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s. Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s, and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008. The local community had been concerned that the historic bridge would be lost, but it remains in use as part of the local road network, and has been listed on both the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory and the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places.|$|E

2500|$|Several groups, {{including}} the Standing Rock Sioux and the Society for American Archaeology, have raised {{concerns over the}} thoroughness of archaeological surveys conducted along the pipeline’s corridor. These surveys were carried out {{under the direction of}} the USACE, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA requires consideration of archaeological sites and traditional cultural properties. [...] The initial survey showed 149sites and the pipeline was subsequently moved to avoid 140of them. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which oversees compliance with the NHPA, raised two primary concerns to the USACE about the surveys. They criticized the scope of the investigation, which defined each <b>water</b> <b>crossing</b> as a separate project, and therefore failed to consider the pipeline as a whole. They also criticized the lack of tribal involvement in the surveys.|$|E
2500|$|While Lee {{remained}} {{unaware of}} Grant's intentions, Union army engineers constructed the longest pontoon {{bridge of the}} war. It stretched [...] over deep <b>water,</b> <b>crossing</b> the James from Weyanoke to Windmill Point at Flowerdew Hundred. Work started at 4 p.m. on June 15 and was completed seven hours later. Although most of Grant's infantry crossed the river by boats, the IX Corps, one division of VI Corps, the animals and supply wagons, {{and a part of}} the artillery crossed on the bridge on June 15 and 16. By the morning of June 17, more than 100,000 men, 5,000 wagons and ambulances, 56,000 horses and mules, and 2,800 head of cattle had crossed the river without alerting the Confederates.

The stag made for the strath here, and Dick, who had no gillie, but was an independent sportsman of the old school, pursued on foot. Plunging down the low, birch-clad hills, the stag found the flooded river before him, black and swollen with rain. He took the <b>water,</b> <b>crossing</b> by the big pool, which looked almost like a little loch, tempestuous under a north wind blowing up stream, and covered with small white, vicious crests. The stag crossed and staggered up the bank, where he stood panting.

There is a field there with a mound in it, on which grows a clump of old oak-trees. Here the two friends were doomed without trial to die. It is said that the minister of Irongray at that time was suspected of favourable leanings toward the Covenanters, and that the proprietor of the neighbouring farm of Hallhill betrayed similar symptoms; hence the selection of the particular spot between the two places, in order to intimidate both the minister and the farmer. This may well have been the case, for history shows that a very strong and indomitable covenanting spirit prevailed among the parishioners of Irongray as well as among the people of the South and West of Scotland generally. Indeed Wodrow, the historian, says that the people of Irongray were the first to offer strenuous opposition to the settlement of the curates.|$|E
