40|$|A one dimensional, {{computational}} {{model for the}} propagation of ultra low frequency (ULF; 1 - 100 mHz) wave fields from the Earth's magnetosphere through the ionosphere, atmosphere and into the ground is presented. The model is formulated to include solutions for high latitudes where the Earth's magnetic field, (B 0 ), is near vertical and for oblique magnetic fields applicable at lower latitudes. The model is used to investigate the <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> azimuth in the magnetosphere compared with the ground wave fields, {{as a function of}} the dip angle of B 0 . We find that for typical ULF wave scale sizes, a 90 &deg; rotation of the <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> azimuth from the magnetosphere to the ground occurs at high latitudes. However, this effect does not necessarily occur at lower latitudes in all cases. We show that the degree to which the <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> azimuth rotates critically depends on the properties of the compressional ULF wave mode...|$|E

40|$|While {{performing}} an {{ionospheric sounding}} the information {{brought by the}} polarisation of the received echo is not essential. In fact, the "AIS" ionosonde [Arokiasami 2002], developed at INGV in the recent years, {{does not allow for}} this piece of information but it is able to generate good quality ionograms, from which it is possible to discriminate between the ordinary and the extraordinary ray. Anyway, if the polarisation information is available the automatic scaling of the ionograms can be more effective. This work consists of some theoretical and technological considerations, fundamental to the development of an improved ionosonde model, that has been carried on at INGV. The magnetoionic theory of propagation of radio waves into the ionosphere is assumed as known; so only some concepts concerning more tightly the <b>waves</b> <b>polarisation</b> and the creation of the ordinary and the extraordinary rays are developed; eventually the practical ways by which it is possible to discriminate them by means of a sounding instrument are described...|$|R

40|$|Gravitational wave {{observations}} {{have been}} used to test Lorentz symmetry by looking for dispersive effects that are caused by higher order corrections to the dispersion relation. In this Letter I argue on general grounds that, when such corrections are present, there will also be a scalar excitation. Hence, a smoking-gun observation of Lorentz symmetry breaking would be the direct detection of scalar waves that travel at a speed other than the speed of the standard gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>polarisations</b> or the speed of light. Interestingly, in known Lorentz-breaking gravity theories the difference between the speeds of scalar and tensor waves is virtually unconstrained, whereas the difference between the latter and the speed of light is already severely constrained by the coincident detection of gravitational waves and gamma rays from a binary neutron star merger.

Even if polarisation of GPR signal is often an underestimated feature during data analysis and post processing, detection or avoidance of a specific target can be managed handling its polarimetric response. This opportunity is of high importance in this field of application, where the mixture of target with different polarimetric response is a commonly encountered situation. To provide an insight of this, two multicomponent GPR surveys have been performed: a first survey to show the effect of antenna-target mutual alignment variation and a second experiment in which the benefits of acquiring with different antenna arrangements are clearly evident. Because each antenna arrangement is sensitive towards different features of the received wavefield, this strategy is able to discriminate targets depending on their geometrical shape, thus delivering better detailed image of the acquired area...|$|E

The non-linear hereditary terms come from the monopole-quadrupole multipole interactions or tails, present at the 1. 5 PN, 2 PN and 2. 5 PN orders, and the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction arising at the 2. 5 PN level.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a non-contact ultrasonic system capable of measuring the thickness of aluminium sheet with sub-micron accuracy. The thickness of sheet has been calculated from ultrasonic data obtained using a send-receive, radially polarised shear wave Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT). Sheets in the thickness range between 0. 1 mm to 0. 5 mm have been measured using this non-contact approach at a stand-off of up to 1. 5 mm.

40|$|The cold, core plasma {{mass density}} in the Earth's {{magnetosphere}} may be deduced from the resonant behaviour of ultra-low frequency (ULF; 1 – 100 mHz), magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Ground-based magnetometers {{are the most}} widely used instruments for recording the signature of ULF wave activity in the magnetosphere. For a suitable model of the background magnetic field and a functional form for the variation of the proton number density with radial distance, the resonant frequencies of ULF waves provide estimates of the equatorial plasma mass density. At high latitudes, the magnetic field model becomes critical when estimating the plasma mass density from FLR data. We show that a dipole field model is generally inadequate for latitudes greater than ~ 65 ° geomagnetic compared with models that are keyed to magnetic activity, interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind properties. Furthermore, the method often relies on the detection of the fundamental ULF resonance, which changes frequency depending on the polarisation of the oscillation.

40|$|It has {{generally}} been assumed {{in the past that}} the plasmapause is a preferred region for the generation and propagation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. One assumption invoked the overlap of the expanding cold plasmapause with the inner edge of the hot ring current during storm recovery to provide favourable conditions for EMIC instability. The plasmapause was also expected to provide a convenient gradient for guiding the waves from equatorial sources to higher latitudes. The paper commences from a historic perspective and reviews the development of the ideas from the 1960 s that relate the source of EMIC waves to the plasmapause. CRRES spacecraft observations of EMIC wave events over L = 3. 5 – 8 and associated plasmapause locations indicate that the plasmapause is a region of wave generation and propagation, with significant wave power seen in the plasmatrough, but is not necessarily the preferred region. Other results show that wave occurrence predominates in the afternoon and increases with radial distance and a He⁺ slot is seen in the data.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{predictions}} of an inflationary phase starting from a homogeneous and anisotropic universe of the Bianchi I type. After discussing {{the evolution of the}} background spacetime, focusing on the number of e-folds and the isotropization, we solve the perturbation equations and predict the power spectra of the curvature perturbations and gravity waves at the end of inflation. The main features of the early anisotropic phase is (1) a dependence of the spectra on the direction of the modes, (2) a coupling between curvature perturbations and gravity waves, and (3) the fact that the two gravity <b>waves</b> <b>polarisations</b> do not share the same spectrum on large scales. All these effects are significant only on large scales and die out on small scales where isotropy is recovered. They depend on a characteristic scale that can, but a priori must not, be tuned to some observable scale. To fix the initial conditions, we propose a procedure that generalises the one standardly used in inflation but that takes into account the fact that the WKB regime is violated at early times when the shear dominates. We stress that there exist modes that do not satisfy the WKB condition during the shear-dominated regime and for which the amplitude at the end of inflation depends on unknown initial conditions. On such scales, inflation loses its predictability. This study paves the way to the determination of the cosmological signature of a primordial shear, whatever the Bianchi I spacetime. It thus stresses the importance of the WKB regime to draw inflationary predictions and demonstrates that when the number of e-folds is large enough, the predictions converge toward those of inflation in a Friedmann-Lemaitre spacetime but that they are less robust {{in the case of an}} inflationary era with a small number of e-folds.

40|$|In this work, {{aspects of}} {{electromagnetic}} vector wave propagation and scattering are considered {{in relation to}} investigations {{on the role of}} polarisation in synthetic aperture radar interferometry. Based on the Maxwell equations, the underlying principles of radar polarimetry and SAR interferometry are introduced in order to treat a general formulation of vector wave interferometry. It is shown how polarimetric basis transformations may be introduced in SAR interferometry in order to form interferograms between all possible polarisation states. This reveals the strong dependency of the interferometric coherence on the states used to form the interferograms. Then, the coherence optimisation problem, involving maximisation of interferometric coherence is solved, leading to a new coherent polarimetric interferometric decomposition. For the interpretation of the addressed techniques, a simplified stochastic model for an elevated forest canopy is developed, and used to demonstrate the relevance of <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> on the physical interpretation of SAR interferograms. Finally, the technique of polarimetric differential interferometry is introduced.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} data analysis, a central {{component}} of gravitational wave astronomy. After a short {{introduction to the}} field we discuss the techniques used {{to search for the}} three classes of gravitational wave signals. These include well predicted signals such as coalescing compact binaries, less certain signals such as those from supernovae, and the stochastic signals from gravitational wave backgrounds. We will finish by briefly discussing issues relevant to network detection. Introduction Observing gravitational waves requires a data analysis strategy that is in many ways different from conventional astronomical data analysis. There are several reasons why this is so. Gravitational wave antennae are essentially omni-directional, with their response better than 50 % of the root mean square over 75 % of the sky. Hence, data analysis systems will have to carry out all-sky searches for sources. Additionally, gravitational wave interferometers are typically broadband, covering three to four orders of magnitude in frequency. While this is obviously to our advantage, as it helps to track sources whose frequency may change rapidly, it calls for searches to be carried out over a wide range of frequencies. In Einstein's theory, gravitational radiation has two independent states of polarisation. Measuring polarisation is of fundamental importance as there are other theories of gravity in which the number of polarisation states is more than two; in some theories dipolar and even scalar waves exist (Will, 1993). Polarisation has astrophysical implications too. For example, gravitational <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> measurements can be very helpful in resolving the degeneracy that occurs in the measurement of the mass and inclination of a binary system...|$|E
40|$|A 20 X 30 km 2, 15 station, seismic network {{operated}} for 3 {{months in}} 1985, near Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift. The array provided both continuous and triggered seismic data. This thesis {{is concerned with}} the local earthquakes which occurred within 30 km of the network, in a 50 X 80 km 2 study area including parts of the Rift shoulder and the central trough. 572 small events (ML < 2. 7) could be located accurately (+ 2 km) in 3 dimensions. Unexpectedly, most of the seismic activity is associated with the major faults of the Rift shoulder, rather than the younger, minor faults in the central trough. A linear group of events in the central trough do not correspond to any surface feature, and seem to indicate a buried fault. The depth distribution of the seismicity peaks at 9 km and diminishes below 12 km, and the "brittle-ductile" transition is inferrred to occur within a 12 - 16 km depth range. This distribution is similar to those in other young intracontinental regions, suggesting a normal crustal rheology. Only a few events provided well-constrained focal mechanisms. Normal, steeply dipping, N-S striking fault plane solutions could be fitted to almost all events in the central trough. 12 of the best solutions were used to determine the stress orientation, the results indicated near-horizontal E-W extension, but this direction was poorly constrained. Suitable seismograms displayed shear <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> and splitting compatible with the predictions of Extensive Dilatancy Anisotropy (EDA) theory. Instrinsic anisotropy, due to the basement fabric, is probably present, but the EDA should dominate the observations, thus allowing a determination of present-day stress orientation.

40|$|Ionospheric {{modification}} {{by means}} of high-power electromagnetic (EM) waves can result in the excitation of a diverse range of plasma waves and instabilities. This thesis presents the development and application of a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code designed to simulate the time-explicit response of an ionospheric plasma to incident EM waves. Validation tests are presented in which the code achieved good agreement with the predictions of plasma theory and the computations of benchmark software. The code was used to investigate the mechanisms behind several recent experimental observations which have not been fully understood, including the effect of 2 D density inhomogeneity on the O-mode to Z-mode conversion process and thus {{the shape of the}} conversion window, and the influence of EM <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> and frequency on the growth of density irregularities. The O-to-Z-mode conversion process was shown to be responsible for a strong dependence of artificially-induced plasma perturbation on both the EM wave inclination angle and the 2 D characteristics of the background plasma. Allowing excited Z-mode waves to reflect back towards the interaction region was found to cause enhancement of the electric field and a substantial increase in electron temperature. Simulations of O-mode and X-mode polarised waves demonstrated that both are capable of exciting geomagnetic field-aligned density irregularities, particularly at altitudes where the background plasma frequency corresponds to an electron gyroharmonic. Inclusion of estimated electrostatic fields associated with irregularities in the simulation algorithm resulted in an enhanced electron temperature. Excitation of these density features could address an observed asymmetry in anomalous absorption and recent unexplained X-mode heating results reported at EISCAT. Comparing simulations with ion motion allowed or suppressed indicated that a parametric instability was responsible for irregularity production. Simulation of EM wave fields confirmed that X-mode waves are capable of exceeding the threshold for parametric instability excitation under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|Polarisation, {{which was}} first studied in optics, is a {{fundamental}} property of all electromagnetic fields. A convenient way to describe the polarisation of two dimensional electromagnetic fields is given by the Stokes parameters. This thesis deals with different aspects of <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> and electromagnetic field measurements. A generalisation of the Stokes parameters to three dimensions is presented. The theory {{has been used to}} develop methods and systems for obtaining the polarisation parameters of electromagnetic waves. The methods can be applied {{for a wide range of}} electromagnetic fields, measured both on ground and onboard satellites. The applications include, e. g., direction-finding, polarisation analysis, radar, and several examples in the field of wireless communication. Further applications are given in the analysis of satellite data, where a whistler wave is considered. Whistlers are circularly polarised electromagnetic waves propagating in the magnetosphere along the geomagnetic field. Dispersion in the magnetospheric plasma make the whistler frequencies travel at different speeds and the signal takes the form of a chirp. From instantaneous polarisation analysis of the whistler´s magnetic wave field, the normal to the polarisation plane is obtained and found to precess around the geomagnetic field. A statistic analysis of ionospheric stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) is also presented. SEE is generated by injecting a powerful high frequency radio wave into the ionosphere. It is shown that the SEE features have a statistical behaviour indistinguishable from the amplitude and phase distributions of narrow-band Gaussian noise. The results suggests that SEE cannot be explained by simple coherent processes alone. Finally, an expression for the complex Poynting theorem is derived for the general case of anharmonic fields. It is found that the complex Poynting theorem, for real fields and sources, is not a conservation law of the imaginary part of electromagnetic energy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} very small strain elastic behaviour of soils under unsaturated conditions, using bender/extender element (BEE) testing. The behaviour of soils at very small strains has been widely studied under saturated conditions, whereas much less work has been performed on very small strain behaviour under unsaturated conditions. A suction-controlled double wall triaxial apparatus for unsaturated soil testing was modified to incorporate three pairs of BEEs transmitting both shear and compression waves with vertical and horizontal directions of wave transmission and <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Various different techniques for measuring wave travel time were investigated in both the time domain and the frequency domain and it was concluded that, {{at least for the}} current experimental testing programme, peak-to-first-peak in the time domain was the most reliable technique for determining wave travel time. An experimental test programme was performed on samples of compacted speswhite kaolin clay. Two different forms of compaction were employed (i. e. isotropic and anisotropic). Compacted kaolin soil samples were subjected to constant suction loading and unloading stages at three different values of suction, covering both unsaturated conditions (s= 50 kPa and s= 300 kPa) and saturated conditions (s= 0). Loading and unloading stages were performed at three different values of stress ratio (η= 0, η= 1 and η=- 1). In some tests a wetting-drying cycle was performed before or within the loading stage, with the wetting-drying cycles including both wetting-induced swelling and wetting-induced collapse compression. BEE tests were performed at regular intervals throughout all test stages, to measure shear wave velocity Vs and compression wave velocity Vp and hence to determine values of shear modulus G and constrained modulus M. The experimental test programme was designed to investigate how very small strain shear modulus G and constrained modulus M varied with unsaturated state variables, including how anisotropy of these parameters developed either with stress state (stress-induced anisotropy) or with previous straining (strain-induced anisotropy). A new expression has been proposed for the very small strain shear modulus G of an isotropic soil under saturated and unsaturated conditions. This expression relates the variation of G to only mean Bishop’s stress p* and specific volume v, and it converges to a well-established expression for saturated soils as degree of saturation approaches 1. The proposed expression for G is able to predict the variation of G under saturated and unsaturated conditions at least as well as existing expressions from the literature and it is considerably simpler (employing fewer state variables and fewer soil constants). In addition, unlike existing expressions from the literature, the values of soil constants in the proposed new expression can be determined from a saturated test. It appeared that, in the current project at least, any strain-induced anisotropy of very small strain elastic behaviour was relatively modest, {{with the possible exception of}} loading in triaxial extension. It was therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusion about evolution of strain-induced anisotropy and whether it depended upon the same aspects of soil fabric as evolution of anisotropy of large strain plastic behaviour. Stress-induced anisotropy of very small strain elastic behaviour was apparent in the experimental test programme. An attempt was made to extend the proposed expression for G to include the effect of stress-induced anisotropy. Interpretation of the experimental results indicated that the value of shear modulus was affected by the values of all three principal Bishop’s stresses (in the direction of wave transmission, the direction of <b>wave</b> <b>polarisation</b> and the third mutually perpendicular direction). However, prediction of stress-induced anisotropy was only partially successful, and it was concluded that the effect of Lode angle was also significant...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} imaging in {{electromagnetic radiation}} of {{two very different}} wavelengths, soft X-rays and microwaves, but the approaches to image analysis and image understanding are generally similar. The X-ray images selected for study are incoherent images, while the microwave results derive from coherent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering, The choice of problems considered was governed by the experimental information available. The first study was of the point to point resolution of a scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM) using calibration sequences taken at different values of defocus. To interpret these data classical optical theory for incoherent imaging, based on the Fourier transform, was applied to imaging by Fresnel zone plates, and the resolution, as limited by the level of zone plate fabrication, was established as internationally competitive. An application of imaging with the STXM, the effect of radiation damage on muscle fibrils, was then considered {{on the basis of}} the Radon transform, as an example of the possibility of replacing manual handling of image data by automatic handling. There were two applications of image analysis to microwave images. The first was to use the Karhunen-Loeve, or principal components transform, to decorrelate four, images taken by airborne SAR in different <b>wave</b> <b>polarisations.</b> As the noise element in SAR images is multiplicative, rather than additive as it is in X-ray images, a modification, using logarithmic data, was tried, by which the noise was displayed additively. Considerable gain was found in the concentration of image information in the first principal component image. The second application was to phase unwrapping, and the determination of the surface topography of terrain imaged by satellite SAR. This study is comprehensive and the major component of the work. A review of the available methods of phase unwrapping as developed for SAR imaging, showed that no method had been published in sufficient detail for it to be applied in practice, After evaluation, the residue-cut method was chosen for implementation. A working programme was developed and applied with good results to the interpretation of surface topography using SAR interference data from scenes at Fort Irwin and the Etna volcano.

30|$|Early {{studies of}} ULF wave {{transition}} from the magnetised plasma environment of near Earth space to the atmosphere reported a ‘shielding’ or ‘screening’ effect (e.g. Ashour and Price, 1948). Nishida (1964) summarised understanding at the time for frequencies, ω < 0.1 rad/s. For the appropriate wave mode, the ionosphere modification was understood as a rotation {{in the direction of}} the <b>wave</b> magnetic field (<b>polarisation</b> azimuth) by 90 ° plus an ‘appreciable’ decrease in magnitude at the ground. A common simplification in modeling the situation was to assume a vertical background magnetic field, B 0. Francis and Karplus (1960) also assumed vertical wave propagation.|$|R
40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} Hertz potentials are a formalism for obtaining solutions of Maxwell's equations from solutions of the inhomogeneous <b>wave</b> equation, with <b>polarisation</b> and magnetisation as the sources. We provide {{an overview of}} their covariant transformation properties, and examine an application of Hertz potentials to the Lorentz transformation of localised pulses by Lekner, who obtained a result seeming to contradict Von Laue's theorem. We show that Lekner's result of total energy-momentum not transforming as a four-vector was due to an erroneous transformation of Hertz potentials, that did not take into account their bivector nature.
