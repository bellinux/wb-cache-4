50|$|A player {{may choose}} to place a {{follower}} on a <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> whenever it is placed: however, a follower cannot be placed on a <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> if there is another follower directly opposite. Followers can, however, be placed {{in such a way}} that they are opposite each other through the filling in of intermediate spaces. At the end of wall building, the player on move {{may choose to}} build a tower at either end of the wall; this immediately scores one point for each <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> between the new tower and the previous tower along the wall (or between the tower and the city gate, if there is no intervening tower).|$|E
50|$|If {{any single}} enemy troop manages {{to reach a}} <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> they will begin to tear it down. Stronger (that is, thicker or larger) {{segments}} last longer under the assault, but eventually they crumble down {{and have to be}} constructed again. Special defences on walls (i.e. cauldrons of boiling oil) automatically activate, killing an enemy troop that reaches such a <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> but only if they have been placed into the wall in the design phase. Also, if an enemy soldier reaches a moat section, they have to ford it first in order to pass through.|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} types of apical HCM: (1) true apical form (“spade-like” configuration), (2) {{involvement}} of the apex and symmetric hypertrophy of the four ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>segments,</b> and (3) involvement of the apex with asymmetric involvement of the <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> (“non-spade” apical HCM) [27].|$|R
50|$|Today an old {{circular}} rampart, a {{tower and}} several <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> remain {{of the former}} castle.|$|R
40|$|Segmented troughlike {{reflector}} {{for solar}} cells approach concentration effectiveness of true parabolic reflector yet simpler and less expensive. <b>Walls</b> of <b>segmented</b> reflector composed of reflective aluminized membrane. Lengthwise guide wire applies tension to each wall, thereby dividing each into two separate planes. Planes {{tend to focus}} Sunlight on solar cells at center of trough between <b>walls.</b> <b>Segmented</b> <b>walls</b> provide higher Sunlight concentration ratios than do simple walls...|$|R
50|$|Although aneurysms {{and left}} {{ventricular}} aneurysms may involve any <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> aneurysms in the posterolateral wall are frequently due to pseudoaneurysms. In contrast, {{the most common}} location for a true left ventricular aneurysm involves {{the apex of the}} heart.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> {{is visible}} on both sides. The side that {{originally}} faced West Germany contains sprayed graffiti and {{messages from the}} time the wall was standing; the side that faced East Germany, on the other hand, is entirely blank.|$|E
5000|$|Once a {{particular}} length of trench is reached, a reinforcing cage is {{lowered into the}} slurry-filled pit and the pit is filled with concrete {{from the bottom up}} using tremie pipes. The heavier concrete displaces the bentonite slurry, which is pumped out, filtered, and stored in tanks for use in the next <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> or recycled.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{holistic}} approach to enable mobile robots using video projection in a situation aware and dynamic way. Therefore, we show how to autonomously detect <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> that are suitable {{to be used as}} projection target in a dynamic environment. We derive several quality measures to score the <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> found in the local environment and show how these scores can be used by a particle swarm optimization to find the best local projection position for the mobile robot...|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{there are}} around {{half a dozen}} <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> visible today, varying in length from a few hundred to over 1,000 m. They are {{what is known as}} Pfostenschlitzmauern {{constructed}} of rocks, wood and earth.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} acute left {{ventricular}} failure associated with severe essential hypertension are presented. On admission echocardiography indicated severe dyskinaesia of all <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> of the heart. Anti-hypertensive treatment resulted in {{significant improvement in}} clinical and echocardiographic findings...|$|R
50|$|Muntanyola and Múnter {{are very}} old. The church of St. Quiricus and St. Julietta of Muntanyola was first {{documented}} in 938. The current church (on the same location) {{is from the}} 17th century, built and decorated with the simple forms of the Spanish Baroque. It holds some baroque paintings. The hamlet of Múnter and its church of St. Stephen appeared in documents {{for the first time}} in 929 under the name villa de Montari. Both churches are the main places of interest in the municipality. Múnter also had a castle on a small hill close to the church. Of this castle only a ruined <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> remains.|$|E
50|$|When {{the scoring}} cards {{are drawn from}} the Currency deck, or when there are fewer than four {{buildings}} remaining to be sold, scoring occurs. Each player scores one point for each <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> in their longest wall. The player with the most of a given building card type scores points according to that type; {{in case of a}} tie, points are split between players. More common building types are worth more points, and building types are worth more points in later scoring rounds. In the final scoring round, the player with the most of a given currency type takes the tile of that currency type and may add it to their Alhambra before scoring.|$|E
50|$|City walls enter play {{once the}} first pile is {{exhausted}}. Whenever a feature is scored, walls {{are added to}} the board. The first player to score after the first pile is exhausted places the city gate next to any tile, and thereafter all players must place a <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> such that it is adjacent to a tile and to other wall segments (or the city gate). Wall segments prevent tiles to be placed beyond the wall, and also serve to complete features. After the second pile is exhausted, each player places two wall segments. In a two-player game, two wall segments are placed instead of one after the first pile is exhausted, and four wall segments are placed instead of two after the second pile is exhausted.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There is much {{evidence-based}} research {{proving the}} effectiveness of contrast echocardiography, {{but there are still}} questions and concerns about its specific uses. This study tested {{the effectiveness of}} contrast echocardiography in defining the left ventricular endocardial border. Methods: From 30 patients, a total of 60 echocardiograms –– 30 with and 30 without use of contrast –– were retrospectively reviewed by four blinded cardiologists with advanced training in echocardiography. No single cardiologist reviewed contrast and noncontrast images of the same patient. Each set of 30 echocardiograms was then studied for wall-motion scoring. Visualization of left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> and a global visualization confidence level of interpretation were recorded. Results: Of all <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> (N = 510), 91...|$|R

50|$|Larssen {{sheet piling}} {{is a kind}} of sheet piling {{retaining}} <b>wall.</b> <b>Segments</b> with indented profiles (troughs) interlock to form a wall with alternating indents and outdents. The troughs increase resistance to bending. The segments are typically made of steel or another metal.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} main hall {{fills the}} entire {{width of the}} courtyard divided into a three aisles. Surrounding it are a total of 41 irregular rooms that are not symmetrical. From 1977 to 1982 Kassem Toueir excavated and rebuilt {{the site for the}} Syrian Department of Antiquities. The walls and arches now visible are mainly reconstructed from newly fired bricks. One original diagonal <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> remains, with a three-storey stucco, where the various remains of the past are superimposed on the modern, with some ancient Muqarnas and stepped arched niches still recognisable. When Friedrich Sarre and Ernst Herzfeld visited the site in 1907, followed by Gertrude Bell in 1910, they found this part of the building as a single upright on an otherwise flat ruin.|$|E
50|$|Slurry {{walls are}} {{typically}} constructed by {{starting with a}} set of guide walls, typically 1 m deep and 0.5 m thick. The guide walls are constructed on the ground surface to outline the desired slurry trench and guide the excavation machinery. Excavation is done using a special clamshell-shaped digger or a hydromill trench cutter, suspended from a crane. The excavator digs down to design depth (or bedrock) for the first <b>wall</b> <b>segment.</b> The excavator is then lifted and moved along the trench guide walls to continue the trench with successive cuts as needed. The trench is at all times kept filled with slurry to prevent its collapse, but the liquid filling allows the excavation machinery and excavation spoil to be moved without hindrance.|$|E
50|$|From {{the second}} floor to the {{underside}} of the cantilevered balcony the walls are English bond clay brick except for a segment on part of the third floor (at about 10,500mm to 13,000mm above ground) where the outer half of the wall is stone with brick inside. Some random stones run the full width of the wall here. Six narrow, regularly spaced windows open out of this <b>wall</b> <b>segment.</b> There are low rise brick arches above them and timber middle and inner lintels. In the brick above this segment, on the inside, there are curved hardwood plates (these appear to be the remains of the windmill's curb support, curb and cap frame cut down by Andrew Petrie in 1861 to provide clearance for the stairway). These timbers appear to have been locally sourced and comprise grey ironbark and spotted gum and yellow wood (Eucalyptus siderophloia, Eucalyptus maculata and Flindersia xanthoxya).|$|E
50|$|The siphuncle {{is located}} {{close to the}} ventral <b>wall.</b> <b>Segments</b> are {{box-shaped}} and strongly expanded. Septal necks are strongly recumbent; connecting rings thick, with inflated bullettes. Parietal deposits grow forward from the septal foremina, commonly forming a continuous internal lining. Cameral deposits are common.|$|R
50|$|The line is also {{referred}} to as the Attila Line, named after the Turkish code-name for the 1974 military intervention: Operation Atilla. Turkish forces built a barrier on the zone's northern side, consisting mainly of barbed-wire fencing, concrete <b>wall</b> <b>segments,</b> watchtowers, anti-tank ditches, and minefields.|$|R
50|$|The City Walls adds eight city wall {{cards to}} the deck, {{which allows the}} player to add <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> to tiles without them. Walls added in this manner, however, cannot be removed for the {{remainder}} of the game, and may not have city gates built on them.|$|R
40|$|An ink jetprinting device {{includes}} {{a pressure chamber}} formed by a plurality of wall segments, a first aperture extending through a <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> and communicating with an ink jet orifice and a second aperture extending through a <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> and communicating with an ink supply duct. The pressure chamber is arranged to contain an ink composition including a carrier composition and a composition including at least one functional component. The plurality of wall segments are at least partly coated with a coating layer of a coating compound having a stronger interaction {{with at least one}} component of the carrier composition relative to the composition including the at least one functional component. A method for manufacturing such an ink-jet printing device is disclosed...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{architectural}} {{plans as}} data source, {{we proposed a}} method which can automatically generate indoor map spatial data. Firstly, referring to the spatial data demands of indoor map, we analyzed the basic characteristics of architectural plans, and introduced concepts of <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> adjoining node and adjoining <b>wall</b> <b>segment,</b> based on which basic flow of indoor map spatial data automatic generation was further established. Then, according to the adjoining relation between wall lines at the intersection with column, we constructed a repair method for wall connectivity {{in relation to the}} column. Utilizing the method of gradual expansibility and graphic reasoning to judge wall symbol local feature type at both sides of door or window, through update the enclosing rectangle of door or window, we developed a repair method for wall connectivity in relation to the door or window and a method for transform door or window into indoor map point feature. Finally, on the basis of geometric relation between adjoining <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> median lines, a wall center-line extraction algorithm was presented. Taking one exhibition hall's architectural plan as example, we performed experiment and results show that the proposed methods have preferable applicability to deal with various complex situations, and realized indoor map spatial data automatic extraction effectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{beam theory}} for open and closed section, thin-walled, {{composite}} beams is presented. The layup of each <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> is arbitrary, {{the effects of}} shear deformation and restrained warping are neglected. Closed form expressions are developed for the calculation of the 4 4 stiffness matrix. It is also shown that the local bending stiffnesses of the wall segments may be neglected when the laminate is either symmetrical or orthotropic. 1...|$|E
50|$|The rim of Abenezra has a noticeably {{polygonal}} shape, with uneven <b>wall</b> <b>segments.</b> The inner <b>walls</b> are terraced, and {{the floor}} is irregular and ridged. These ridges form unusual, sinuous patterns across the floor. The crater overlays {{the eastern part of}} another crater-like formation designated Abenezra C.|$|R
50|$|On July 17 {{parts were}} {{obtained}} from Resolute {{that were used to}} construct a crude replacement trailer. Enlisting the help of volunteers from HMP and members of a Japanese TV crew, six of the <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> were transported from their landing location within the crater to the construction site.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} may {{be completed}} by placement of <b>wall</b> <b>segments,</b> and they are scored at that time. This does not, however, cause new walls to be built. Completed roads or markets that do not score due {{to the absence of}} followers do not cause walls {{to be added to the}} city.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 67). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Naphthalene sublimation and pressure measurement experiments were conducted to study heat (mass) transfer enhancement by blockages with staggered round and square holes for turbulent air flows through the holes in the blockages in an 8 : 1 rectangular channel. The diameter of six round holes and the width and the height of six square holes in each of four blockages were 2 / 3 of the height of the channel. The distance between consecutive blockages was two times the channel height. Average and local heat (mass) transfer and overall pressure drop results were obtained for four Reynolds numbers, defined based on the channel hydraulic diameter, of between 7, 000 and 28, 000. The results showed that the blockages enhanced the average heat (mass) transfer on the channel wall by 4. 7 to 6. 3 times, and increased the pressure drop along the test channel by up to almost 490 times that for fully developed turbulent flow through a smooth channel at the same mass flow rates. The blockages with round holes enhanced more heat (mass) transfer on the channel wall but caused larger pressure drops than the blockages with square holes. For a given pumping power, the blockages with square holes enhanced more heat (mass) transfer than the blockages with round holes. Because of the very large pressure drops caused by both the blockages with round and square holes, the heat (mass) transfer per unit pumping power was lower with the blockages than without the blockages. The local heat (mass) transfer was very high immediately upstream of a blockage, but was quite low immediately downstream of a blockage. The streamwise variation of the heat (mass) transfer coefficient was smaller on the <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> between two blockages with square holes than between two blockages with round holes. Flow reattachment on the <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> downstream of a square hole increased the heat (mass) transfer over two symmetrical regions on the <b>wall</b> <b>segment.</b> In the case of the round holes, the air jets might reattach near the downstream end of the <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> where the heat (mass) transfer was very high...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system which}} allows the selective reisolation and structural analysis of a newly made (nascent) segment of pneumococcal peptidoglycan at various times after its incorporation into the preexisting old cell wall was developed. Age-related changes were observed in {{each one of the}} major nine wall peptide components resolvable by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The nascent <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> (made in 1. 7 % of a generation time) contained 60 % of its peptides as the alanyl-isoglutamyl-lysine tripeptide monomer, 12 % as the directly cross-linked peptide dimer (tri-tetra peptide), and a total of 2 % as the two major peptide trimers. In the mature <b>wall</b> <b>segment</b> reisolated 1 h later (1 generation time), the proportion of the tripeptide monomer dropped to 40 %, while the major dimer and trimers increased to 23 % and 8 %, respectively. The age-related structural changes were completely inhibited by cefotaxime. The observations indicate that covalent bonds in the structure of pneumococcal peptidoglycan undergo substantial secondary rearrangements after incorporation into the preexisting wall. These changes are likely {{to be related to the}} movement of the conserved cell wall segments within the cell surface during cell division...|$|E
40|$|Background: More {{diagnostic}} techniques {{require a}} better understanding of the forces and stresses developed in the wall of the left ventricle. The aim of this study was to differentiate significant coronary artery disease (CAD) patients using a non-invasive quantification of myocardial wall stress in the diastole phase. Methods: Sixty male subjects with sinus rhythm (30 patients with significant and 30 with moderate left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis in the proximal portion) as well as 35 healthy subjects as the control group were recruited into the present study. By two-dimensional, pulsed wave, and tissue Doppler echocardiography, the average end-diastolic wall stress was calculated at the left ventricle anterior and interventricular septum <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> using regional <b>wall</b> thickness, meridional and circumferential radii, and non-invasive left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Results: A comparison of the calculated end-diastolic myocardial wall stress between the patients with significant and moderate coronary stenosis on the one hand and the healthy subjects on the other showed statistically significant differences in the anterior and septum <b>wall</b> <b>segments</b> (p value < 0. 05). The patients with significant left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis had higher end-diastolic myocardial wall stress than did those with moderate stenosis and the healthy group in all the anterior and septum <b>wall</b> <b>segments.</b> Conclusion: It is concluded that non-invasive end-diastolic myocardial wall stress in coronary artery disease patients i...|$|R
