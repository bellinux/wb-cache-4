5|$|One Yak-15 <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> a {{prototype}} aerial refueling system in 1949, although the installation on the fighter and the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber {{used as the}} tanker were both dummies to test procedures and fit.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 {{was converted}} {{to replace the}} Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E

5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed and the line closed again in 1910. A section of the track <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007.|$|E

5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed. One gun, of an unknown calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> {{the configuration of}} the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> the aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight {{was conducted with}} a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways {{might be the only}} runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{part of the}} 2nd BS through February 1919, but {{had been}} transferred to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet by May, Orion becoming the squadron flagship. By the end of 1919, the 3rd BS had been disbanded and the sisters had been transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, although Monarch was transferred to Portsmouth in early 1920. Monarch and Thunderer were temporarily recommissioned {{during the summer of}} 1920 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. Orion joined Monarch at Portsmouth later in the year and became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Conqueror followed Orion to Portsmouth and relieved her as flagship in mid-1921 and the latter ship was again temporarily recommissioned to transport troops. Thunderer was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and Orion became a gunnery training ship after being relieved. In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, Orion and Conqueror were sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year; Monarch was initially listed for sale, but was hulked instead. In 1923, she was converted into a target ship and <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> the effects of bombs and shells, until she was sunk in early 1925. Thunderer was the last surviving ship and was sold in late 1926. On her way to the scrapyard, she ran aground {{at the entrance to the}} Port of Blyth, Northumberland, but was refloated and scrapped the following year.|$|E
