40|$|Although the {{encapsulation}} of paclitaxel into liposomes {{has been}} extensively studied, its significant hydrophobic and uncharged character has generated substantial difficulties concerning its efficient encapsulation into the inner <b>water</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> liposomes. We found that a more hydrophilic paclitaxel molecule, 7 -glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel, retained tubulin polymerization stabilization activity. The hydrophilic nature of 7 -glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel allowed its efficient encapsulation into the inner <b>water</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> liposomes, which was successfully accomplished using a remote loading method with a solubility gradient between 40 % ethylene glycol and Cremophor EL/ethanol in PBS.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that the immunoliposomes enhanced the toxicity of 7 -glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel in HER 2 -overexpressing cancer cells and showed more rapid suppression of cell growth. The immunoliposomes strongly inhibited the tumor growth of HT- 29 cells xenografted in nude mice. Notably, mice survived when treated with the immunoliposomes formulation, even when administered at a lethal dose of 7 -glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel in vivo.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{encapsulation}} {{of proteins}} and nucleic acids within the nanoscale <b>water</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> reverse micelles {{has been used}} for over 3 decades as a vehicle {{for a wide range of}} investigations including enzymology, the physical chemistry of confined spaces, protein and nucleic acid structural biology, and drug development and delivery. Unfortunately, the static and dynamical aspects of the distribution of water in solutions of reverse micelles complicate the measurement and interpretation of fundamental parameters such as pH. This is a severe disadvantage in the context of (bio) chemical reactions and protein structure and function, which are generally highly sensitive to pH. There is a need to more fully characterize and control the effective pH of the reverse micelle <b>water</b> <b>core.</b> The buffering effect of titratable head groups of the reverse micelle surfactants is found to often be the dominant variable defining the pH <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>core.</b> Methods for measuring the pH of the reverse micelle aqueous interior using one-dimensional 1 H and two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy are described. Strategies for setting the effective pH of the reverse micelle <b>water</b> <b>core</b> are demonstrated. The exquisite sensitivity of encapsulated proteins to the surfactant, water content, and pH of the reverse micelle is also addressed. These results highligh...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to put forward a discussion of how a better understanding of the issues surrounding control can be an important element in the development of generativity strategies in business models for mobile platforms, such as Apple's iPhone. Generativity refers to "a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences" [29]. In this paper generativity is defined as the ability of a self-contained system to create, generate, or produce new content, structure, or behaviour without additional help or input from the original creators [23]. Although generativity is at the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>Apple's</b> expansion model, the company has to keep a tight control on the innovation platforms in order to protect their revenue sources, whilst at the same time ensuring that this does not stifle third party development and the innovation of compelling services. This is part achieved by the controlling access to the platform through the App Store for all actors of the platform ecosystem. It is possible to analyse the relationships between Apple and the other actors <b>of</b> the <b>Apple</b> Mobile Platform and identify through a longitudinal analysis of control the formation of strategies that balance or shift the control between actors, which gives further insight on possible sources of revenue based on the value network defined for such control points...|$|R
25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic <b>Water</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard there is quite a lot of freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal.
