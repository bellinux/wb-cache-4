5|$|MiniDisc, Columbia CM 40579 (US). Only as {{the master}} prior to 1997, {{but not as}} the Jazz Masterpiece remaster. This <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> {{by the end of}} the 1990s when {{production}} of Jazz Masterpiece series had ceased. None issued were at the correct speed.|$|E
5|$|Seiderman {{developed}} a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster {{cast of the}} face {{of each of the}} actors who aged, except Joseph Cotten who <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> at that time. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.|$|E
5|$|Wallis's {{first choice}} for {{director}} was William Wyler, but he <b>was</b> <b>unavailable,</b> so Wallis {{turned to his}} close friend Michael Curtiz. Curtiz was a Hungarian Jewish émigré; {{he had come to}} the U.S. in 1926, but some of his family were refugees from Nazi Europe.|$|E

5000|$|A witness may <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> for {{a variety}} of reasons. A common reason for a witness to <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> <b>is</b> that the witness is {{claiming}} a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. Other privileges are also a source of unavailability. Witnesses may also <b>be</b> <b>unavailable</b> because they have died, had memory loss, or simply decided not to cooperate as a witness against the defendant.|$|R

5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Final Destination, New Line Cinema contacted Reddick regarding {{plans for a}} sequel.

Final Destination 2 was released on January 31, 2003, {{as well as on}} DVD on July 22, 2003, which includes commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, and videos.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose {{made his}} {{debut in the}} English County Championship for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1989—the club signed him for the 1988 season but as he was playing in the West Indies touring team, he <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> that year. He took a wicket with his first {{delivery}} for the club, but was not particularly successful {{in the first part}} of the season; he settled down later and took 28 first-class wickets at 28.39 for Northamptonshire in nine games.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} against Richmond, Temple Owls {{announced}} that starting center Micheal Eric <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> {{for the season}} with a right patella injury. Lavoy Allen returned and Temple Owls ended the Spiders' eight game road winning streak, scoring 73–53. Ramone Moore scored 24 points. Juan Fernandez registered 20 points off of 9–10 shooting. Temple Owls controlled the game with a 16–0 run in the second half and shot 56 percent on the game. Lavoy Allen became Temple Owls' all-time leading rebounder in a 66–52 rout of Saint Joseph's. Allen snatched 12 boards to surpass Temple Owls radio analyst Johnny Baum's career 1,042 rebounds. Ramone Moore's 17 points led the team, and Allen scored 14 points to go along with his milestone rebounds. Temple Owls' forward Scootie Randall <b>was</b> <b>unavailable,</b> having a foot injury.

5|$|Bill Wallis, {{who played}} Mr. Prosser and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in the {{original}} series, <b>was</b> <b>unavailable,</b> and Toby Longworth took the role of Jeltz in the new series.

5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had {{his first}} success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have {{influenced}} his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he <b>was</b> <b>unavailable,</b> J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. Fender {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.|$|E

5|$|Following the tour, Wright {{left the}} group {{to work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade.

5|$|For the 1909 season, MacLaren {{worked to}} improve his fitness prior to that summer's Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, but when he <b>was</b> <b>unavailable,</b> MacLaren was {{appointed}} captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled in their early tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren's deployment of fielders.|$|E
5|$|Gunn {{represented}} Scotland at {{the youth}} international level. He {{was part of}} the squad that won the 1982 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship, but <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> to play in the final because Aberdeen had reached the 1982 Scottish Cup Final. He was replaced by Robin Rae for the final, in which the Scots beat Czechoslovakia 3–1.|$|E

5|$|John Barry, who {{had worked}} on the {{previous}} five films, <b>was</b> <b>unavailable</b> during production. Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked Paul McCartney to write the theme song. Since McCartney's salary of $15,000 (plus royalties) was high and another composer of Barry's stature could not be hired with {{the remainder of the}} music budget, George Martin, who had little experience of film scoring, was hired.|$|E
