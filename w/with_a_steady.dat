5|$|Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> {{stream of}} reform and {{attempts}} to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw {{the beginnings of a}} slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment {{was thus}} heavy {{throughout}} the Augustan period, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> {{increase in the}} number of units formed. By AD 23, the Roman historian Tacitus records that there were roughly the same numbers of auxiliaries in service as there were legionaries. Since at this time there were 25 legions of c. 5,000 men each, the Auxilia thus amounted to c. 125,000 men, implying c. 250 auxiliary regiments.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E

5|$|In late July2003, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist northwest of Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) early on July30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 0600UTC on July31, followed by the JTWC at 0600UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north-northwestward {{under the influence of}} a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on August2, thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was well organized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> outflow pattern.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, a {{tropical}} storm was located about 200mi (330km) east of Guadeloupe. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> west-northwest path, the storm moved across the northern Lesser Antilles on September 23, during which it intensified into a hurricane. It passed a short distance north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as it reached its peak intensity of 90mph (150km). Late on September 26 the hurricane turned northwestward, bringing it through the Turks and Caicos Islands and eastern Bahamas. Recurving north-northeastward, the cyclone moved into open waters, and was last classified as {{a tropical}} cyclone on September 30 about 390mi (630km) east of Cape Hatteras. However, one hurricane researcher assessed the hurricane as lasting until October 3, with the cyclone turning eastward and dissipating near the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} {{of carbon}} dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are {{in the form of}} small isolated travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> flow {{of carbon dioxide}}. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

25|$|His {{goal was}} stability, not general control, which {{simplified}} the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to steady-state error), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term {{was added to}} improve stability and control.|$|E
