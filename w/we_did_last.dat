500|$|Prior to the race, Oxford University Boat Club {{president}} and Dutch international rower Sjoerd Hamburger claimed [...] "Last {{year we had}} an exceptional crew, power-wise, which we don't have this year, but we're starting to match the times <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year, so I'm very pleased". His Cambridge counterpart, American Deaglan McEachern, responded: [...] "we're faster". Umpire and former Cambridge Blue Simon Harris suggested {{that he did not}} anticipate any problems with the two coxes obeying his instructions: [...] "I've been impressed by the coxes, how they've responded to the umpire's calls".|$|E
500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is unfortunate}} but true that ‘the environment’ is flavour {{of the month}} at the moment. Unfortunate because, in media terms, this means that next month, when another toxic spill lays waste another urban creek, the {{response}} {{is likely to be}} - 2 ̆ 2 Oh, environment.

5000|$|Brian Higgins said, [...] "By {{the time}} <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the <b>last</b> album, it was different. They were so big then. They {{were ready to}} sell a million albums immediately, so they didn't ... {{something}} a bit highbrow. They needed something that would hit you right between the eyes ... The group has moved more and more into the mainstream, because {{that was what was}} required." ...|$|R

60|$|I daresay {{you know}} already that I held many councils in London {{about coming to}} Ireland at all, and was much against it. Everything looked as bad here as need be, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> very well <b>last</b> night after all.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} be happy if you were left," [...] said Anne. [...] "May I go on as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> winter? I will try to do better now I have him to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the very}} reason," [...] said Mary, the colour flying to her checks. [...] "It will not do to stay {{lingering}} here as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> summer, and not only on your own account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Forrest said. [...] "Let us {{take it for}} granted, then, {{that he did it}} {{only because}} he {{preferred}} to play with me to playing against me. What is to become of our little scheme if we cut as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night all the time?" ...|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz {{noted that}} the episode's conceit got many crew members excited: [...] "We'd never really done an X-Files like this. We could explore Mulder's and Scully's {{differences}} by seeing the extremes of their two hallucinations—a serious version of what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> comically <b>last</b> season in 'Bad Blood'". This presented an opportunity for Mulder to confront his partner {{with the fact that}} he is normally right, resulting in a response from Scully, affirming the fact.|$|R
60|$|The hounds bayed our {{approach}} to camp. We both made a great show about beginning our little camp tasks, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not <b>last</b> very long. The sun felt so good {{and it was so}} pleasant to lounge under a pine. One of the blessings of outdoor life was that a man could be like an Indian and do nothing. So from rest I passed to dreams and from dreams to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|A folk-pop guitar-driven ballad, [...] "White Flag" [...] {{talks about}} changes in our daily life and {{that none of the}} bad things <b>we</b> <b>do</b> will <b>last</b> forever. The last track of the EP, [...] "Best Thing I Got" [...] is a piano pop song with drums and guitar. Lyrically, the song talks about love and [...] "being a non-perfect girl who wants life to be full of freedom and {{learning}} ur own way of how to deal with problems".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you will make it even some time, Bill; so don't let's say {{anything}} more about it, but put on your clothes. We will {{have a cup of}} coffee each and a loaf between us for breakfast, and then we will go for a walk into the park, the same as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> Sunday, and hear the preaching." ...|$|E
60|$|What are {{the reasons}} for this demand? There are three reasons--and only three. Old-age pensions, the navy, and the {{decrease}} in the revenue derived from alcoholic liquor. From those three causes we require sixteen millions more money this year than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year. Now who has a right--this is my first question--to reproach us for that? Certainly the Conservative Party have no right.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well for you," [...] he remarked, dismally, [...] "but it is a horrible grind for me. I have just succeeded in forgetting all that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> session, and our {{programme}} for next. Now I've got to wade through it all. I wonder why on earth Providence selected for me an uncle who thinks it worth while to be a Cabinet Minister?" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{think the}} Pixies had made enough anti-videos that Charles {{was ready to}} do things that were more {{visually}} hopped up. The [...] "Los Angeles" [...] video that <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> the <b>last</b> minute and a half of the song is this open field of grey over which hovercrafts are floating. It's about as tripped up as any video I've ever been involved in, and it was also realizing a dream of Charles', getting him in a hovercraft.|$|R
60|$|This threat had {{the desired}} effect. One by one, {{the men were}} let {{up out of the}} forecastle, and sent into the boat. Cooked meat, bread, rum and water, were {{supplied}} to the English; and, to be ready to meet any accident, we lowered them a compass, and Sennit's quadrant. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> the <b>last</b> at his own earnest request, for he seemed to suspect we intended sending him adrift, as indeed was my plan, at the proper moment.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> really <b>did</b> wonders <b>last</b> {{night in}} the way of arrangement. I see the ground-plan of the first three acts distinctly. The {{dressing}} and furnishing and so forth, will be a perfect picture, and I will answer for the men in three weeks' time.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we {{lose the}} game with Rockville to-day it will be our own fault," [...] he said, to the crowd that {{had participated in the}} Gee Eyes' doings. [...] "We should have gotten home at least an hour earlier than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night--or rather this morning." [...] And then he made each player take a good rubbing down and just enough {{exercise}} to limber up his muscles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, old fellow," [...] he began, when Harnett {{returned}} from making his toilet at the brook-side, [...] "I {{realize that we}} played you a dirty kind of a trick in using your team as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night; {{but at the time}} I was so anxious to get everything over here all right that I did not stop to think about it. Of course, I can't undo what has been done, but if any money trouble comes to you because of last night's work, neither you nor Gurney shall lose a cent. Try to forget it, won't you, George? Shake hands with me, and say that you will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But {{we should}} lose our seven camel-loads of goods, {{and we shall}} want them for trade as we go along," [...] Jethro said. [...] "I propose that we should form the camels into a square, as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night; that you two and six of the men armed with bows and arrows shall occupy it {{and take care of}} the girls, while the rest of us charge the Arabs. If we can defeat the {{horsemen}} it is probable that the men on foot will draw off. But while we are doing so some of those on foot may rush forward and attack you. We will take care not to pursue, and you can rely upon our coming to your assistance as soon as you are attacked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well done, indeed!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Gallantly <b>done,</b> lads! <b>We</b> {{heard the}} firing, and feared {{you would be}} crushed before we could get up.

5000|$|Currently Caustic Resin are {{considered}} to be on an indefinite hiatus however, no official statement has been made. Brett Netson has been quoted to answer the question 'Is Caustic Resin still a band?' with 'Err.. no, maybe... never no, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> one <b>last</b> tour. The small club circuit well, it's not too cool... a threshold got crossed from the late 90's into the early 2000s were things really changed.

6000|$|... "I do not think, señor," [...] Dias said, [...] "that {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to keep that watch, for, as we knew from the noise when you fired last night, there are numbers of birds and at least one beast--I fancy it is a bear from the sound of its roar--up there, and it would be strange if a number of men making their way down did not disturb some of them; indeed, if one bird gave the alarm, it would put them all in motion; besides, there are certainly monkeys, for I heard their cries and chattering when the birds flew up. Still, it is perhaps as well that one of us should watch. Shall we divide, as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night? only, of course, José takes his place with you." ...|$|E

"Our {{orders were}} to go to Sudbury, and I think we'd better keep on in that direction, rather than lose time by {{carrying}} you to Ticonderoga. <b>We</b> could <b>do</b> that <b>last</b> if <b>we</b> pleased, for our boat is hidden among the bushes nearabout where Master Jones turned back.
