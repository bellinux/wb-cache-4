25|$|Ottoman {{artillery}} {{was famous}} for {{the size of its}} cannon, and their number; from the highly mobile anti-personnel Abus gun to the massive Great Turkish Bombard. These bombards were a product of specialised study in the production of 'giant guns' known literally as castle smashers 'kale-kob'. Although such weapons being primarily used in sieges; where they were cast on site due to the logistical difficulties attributed to transport them there, they were used as late as 1809 massive stone-firing guns were used with some effect against British ships during the Dardanelles Operation, throwing 1000-pound marble with a range of 1 mile. Accuracy was achieved by using <b>wadded</b> shots wrapped in sheepskin with ready-measured stacks of powder. Unlike the European powder, the Ottoman powder is thought to be better for upon firing; it produced white smoke rather than black smoke.|$|E
2500|$|The formal attire of {{the field}} {{infantry}} was minimalist. Ordinary foot soldiers were typically dressed only in thick quilted cotton jackets called taikpon (...) , even in the campaigns that required them to cross thick jungles and high mountains. Their dresses were hardly {{enough to keep the}} conscripts warm during the army's punishing, many-week-long marches. The palace guards wore more ostentatious uniforms—Bayinnaung's palace guards wore [...] "golden helmets and splendid dresses"—and rode horses and elephants. In the First Anglo-Burmese War, a Western observer at the Burmese capital noted of the army leaving for the front: [...] "each man was attired in a comfortable campaign jacket of black cloth, thickly <b>wadded</b> and quilted with cotton".|$|E

She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had her cheeks puffed out with cotton and her nose was <b>wadded,</b> too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy."

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to {{encircle}} the subtype of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) present in patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (<b>WAD)</b> and study the debut of TMD symptoms, the provoking factors and the outcome of conservative TMD treatments. The results could add to the aetiological discussion about TMD mainly as being part of chronic <b>WAD</b> pain or not. The subjects were referred patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> at a specialized rehabilitation centre where they were diagnosed using a standardized classification of <b>WAD</b> diagnosing that resulted in approximately 20 % <b>WAD</b> grade 2 and 80 % <b>WAD</b> grade 3. In Studies I and II, a total 136 individuals with chronic <b>WAD</b> {{were found to have}} a significantly higher prevalence of pain associated with TMD compared to a control group of 66 general dental patients. The symptoms debuted approximately six months after the whiplash injury and were most often provoked by stress. In Study III, the effect of a therapeutic jaw exercise (TJE) program on TMD was studied over six months in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD, randomized to TJE (25 subjects) or not (30 subjects). TJE had no effect on TMD. In Study IV, patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD were found to have a mainly myogenous origin of TMD pain. Five months of stabilisation appliance therapy (SAT) equally resulted in an almost complete perceived reduction of jaw pain and frontal headache in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD (n= 14) and TMD patients without <b>WAD</b> (n= 10). In the long-term, TMD was significantly lower in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> who were treated compared to patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD who were not treated (n= 9). TMD in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> grades 2 or 3 may be the same kind of musculoskeletal disorder as in TMD patients without <b>WAD,</b> and not primarily part of the <b>WAD</b> pain. A functional TMD examination as well as assessment of perceived stress can be recommended as part of the standardized screening procedure for patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> grades 2 and 3. Patients with symptoms and signs of TMD could be recommended SAT. Patients with symptoms of frontal headache alone should also be considered as candidates for SAT...|$|R

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster slug and the sabot slug is the <b>wad</b> slug, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun slug designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster slug, a deep hollow is located in the rear of this slug, which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the slug much like the Foster slug. However, unlike the Foster slug, a <b>wad</b> slug additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the slug while also reducing the amount of expansion of the slug when fired, reducing the stress on the shot <b>wad</b> in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster slugs that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} slug, much like those on the Brenneke, the <b>wad</b> slug is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The <b>wad</b> slug is loaded using a standard shotshell <b>wad,</b> which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the <b>wad</b> slug is slightly less than the nominal bore diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge <b>wad</b> slug, and a <b>wad</b> slug is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the slug is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge <b>wad</b> slug masses include -oz. and 1-oz. <b>wad</b> slugs, and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell <b>wad</b> intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card <b>wad</b> is also sometimes located between the slug and the shotshell <b>wad,</b> depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded <b>wad</b> slug shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|R

40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{pregnant}} Yankasa (YK) and West African Dwarf (<b>WAD)</b> ewes, {{made up of}} 6 pregnant YK and 6 pregnant <b>WAD</b> ewes in each group, were assigned at random to first, second and third trimester of pregnancy, to study the clinical manifestation of. T. vivax infection at each trimester of pregnancy. A fourth group made up of 3 pregnant YK and 3 pregnant <b>WAD</b> ewes served as the non-infected controls for the study. Pre- infection mean rectal temperatures of the YK and <b>WAD</b> ewes were 38. 6 Co and 38. 7 Crespectively, while post-infection temperatures were as high as 41. 5 C and 41. 6 C for the YK and <b>WAD</b> ewes respectively.

The infected YK and <b>WAD</b> ewes exhibited pyrexia, signs of anaemia shown by pale mucus membrane, decrease in packed cell volume (PCV) values, decrease in total plasma protein (TP) values, weight loss, lethargy, dullness, abortions and death of ewes. The severity of the infection increased as the pregnancy advanced in the ewes. <b>WAD</b> ewes in the first trimester were least susceptible to the infection and self-cure was observed in one <b>WAD</b> ewe. The infected <b>WAD</b> ewes controlled the effects of the infection on abortions and mortality more than the YK ewes.
