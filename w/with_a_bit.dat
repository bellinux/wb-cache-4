However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

After getting behind early, the change of scenery didn‚Äôt hurt the team in the long run though, as they posted 19‚Äì15 come from behind victory in front of an overflow crowd. The win gave the team a 23‚Äì17 record, and clinched the division and conference titles.

25|$|England's total {{could have}} been {{significantly}} higher <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck ‚Äì the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ricky Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a single for 20. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, hitting 76 runs {{in an hour and}} a half, but a couple of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity.
