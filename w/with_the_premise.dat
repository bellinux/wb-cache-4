5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after coming up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E

Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

Filming began in October in London and the {{production was}} first broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 24 January 2010. It was the second most watched programme of the day but gained mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

25|$|Hamline University (1854) Hamline {{was founded}} and named after Methodist Bishop Leonidas Lent Hamline, who {{provided}} USD $25,000 {{of his own}} money to launch the school. The university opened in Red Wing, Minnesota, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that the school would eventually move to Saint Paul. A statue of the bishop, sculpted by the late professor of art Michael Price, stands on campus. In 1869, the university shut down its operations after enrollment dropped drastically due to the Civil War. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872. A new building opened in 1880 in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood housing 113 students. The building burned in 1883, and the following year, a new building was developed: Old Main, Hamline's oldest remaining building.|$|E

25|$|Then in 1990 and 1993 {{a method}} was finally devised to {{experimentally}} assess whether the anisole and toluene radical anion protonated ortho or meta. The esoteric method began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that the isotope selectivity in protonation in a protium–deuterium medium would be greater for the radical anion, {{of the first}} protonation step, than for the carbanion of the penultimate step. The reasoning was that carbanions are much more basic than the corresponding radical anions and thus will react more exothermically and less selectively in protonation. Experimentally {{it was determined that}} less deuterium at the ortho site than meta resulted (1:7) for a variety of methoxylated aromatics. This is a consequence of the greater selectivity of the radical anion protonation. Computations (e.g. ROHF/6-31g) of the electron densities concurred with the experimental observations. Also, it was ascertained that frontier orbital densities did not, and these had been used in some previous reports.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{science fiction}} author Philip José Farmer wrote Tarzan Alive, a {{biography}} of Tarzan utilizing the frame device {{that he was a}} real person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with Doc Savage and Sherlock Holmes, are the cornerstones of the Wold Newton family. Farmer wrote two novels, Hadon of Ancient Opar and Flight to Opar, set in the distant past and giving the antecedents of the lost city of Opar, which {{plays an important role in}} the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's A Feast Unknown, and its two sequels Lord of the Trees and The Mad Goblin, are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon. A Feast Unknown is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.|$|E

40|$|Logic is {{the study}} of the quality of {{argument}}s. An argument consists of a set of premises and a conclusion.

The truth of <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> is a contingent factor that depends {{on the state of the}} world. <b>The</b> strength <b>with</b> which <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> confirm <b>the</b> conclusion is supposed to be independent of the state of the world.

500|$|As {{he had on}} his 1968 {{debut album}} Song of Innocence, Axelrod {{composed}} musical interpretations {{of the works of}} English poet William Blake on Songs of Experience. He used eight poems from Blake's Songs of Experience (1794). The album's gatefold featured Blake's poems reprinted for each song and liner notes that stated, [...] "an anthology of awareness after birth ... based on the 18th century poems of William Blake." [...] Blake's poems began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> of birth and innocence, and explored themes of life experience, rite of passage, and changes of perspective in life.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "companion-lite" [...] episode, Century House {{was written}} by Tom MacRae for Series 3 of the revised show. The Doctor was to appear on a live {{broadcast}} of Most Haunted, investigating a house haunted by the [...] "Red Widow", with Martha Jones watching at home as a framing device. The episode did not fit into the production schedule, and was pushed back to Series 4 and reworked such that the show was watched by Donna Noble and her mother Sylvia. Due to dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise,</b> and to avoid two comedic episodes in the same series, the episode was dropped and replaced with Davies' Midnight.|$|E
500|$|Hansell {{outlined}} {{an alternate}} strategy for defeating Japan, using precision bombing as its basis, {{that he believed}} would have also succeeded by November 1945 while obviating the need for area bombing using incendiaries or the atomic bomb. He did not find fault with the incendiary strategy per se, but rather <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> that fire-bombing was necessary because otherwise Japan could not be defeated except by invasion of her home islands. Historian Michael Sherry concluded that the case he presented was [...] "powerful". Arnold by implication had erred in changing AAF strategy, especially {{taking into account the}} [...] "deep and pervasive revulsion among the American people against strategic bombing of all sorts" [...] that was a consequence.|$|E

An additional [...] "flop-over" [...] edit restored the image to normal, which became the standard for all broadcasts but compromised the plot: if Doppelgänger is screened in this modified form, the viewer is led {{to conclude that the}} parallel Ross has landed on the non-reversed, normal Earth.|$|E
500|$|Included in {{the first}} game late in the {{development}} process, Reptile's character concept was conceived while Boon was driving back to work from lunch. Noting the success of utilizing a palette swap method for Scorpion and Sub-Zero's character sprites, he and Tobias decided to include a [...] "super secret hidden feature" [...] in Mortal Kombat, choosing Reptile's green color as a contrast to Scorpion's original yellow and Sub-Zero's blue colors. Developed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> of being [...] "a cooler version of Scorpion", the character's concept was completed in a single evening. Reptile's inclusion was intended as a marketing tool for the arcade game: as extreme conditions must be met to encounter Reptile, the designers hoped to rely on word of mouth to spread rumors of the character's existence. However, the character {{was not included in the}} title until version 3.0 of the game.|$|E
