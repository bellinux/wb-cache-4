40|$|We explore phase {{transitions}} of plan modification, which mainly {{focus on}} the conformant planning problems. By analyzing features of plan modification in conformant planning problems, quantitative results are obtained. If the number of operators is less than, almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved <b>with</b> <b>plan</b> modification. If the number of operators is more than, almost all conformant planning problems can be solved <b>with</b> <b>plan</b> modification. The results of the experiments also show that there exists an experimental threshold of density (ratio of number of operators to number of propositions), which separates the region where almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved <b>with</b> <b>plan</b> modification from the region where almost all conformant planning problems can be solved <b>with</b> <b>plan</b> modification...|$|R
