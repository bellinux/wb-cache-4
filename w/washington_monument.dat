5|$|The <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> {{attracted}} enormous crowds {{before it}} officially opened. For {{six months after}} its dedication, 10,041 people climbed the 898 steps and 50 landings to the top. After the elevator {{that had been used}} to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers, the number of visitors grew rapidly, and an average of 55,000 people per month were going to the top by 1888. The annual visitor count peaked between 1979 and 1997, where an average of 1.1 million visitors visited annually; however, from 2005 to 2010, the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> has had an average of only 631,000 visitors each year.

5|$|Washington {{became an}} {{international}} icon for liberation and nationalism, {{as the leader}} of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire. The Federalists made him the symbol of their party but, for many years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument.</b> On January 31, 1781, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln are {{depicted}} in stone at the Mount Rushmore Memorial.

5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base.

After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Myers and {{his wife}} did the first balloon {{ascension}} on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the aeronaut Tracy A. Tisdell to draw crowds. A second ascension was done by Myers on August 27.

50|$|In early 1848, workers {{started to}} build the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument's</b> foundation. According to {{historian}} Jesse Holland, {{it is very likely}} that African-American slaves were among the construction workers and stonecutters, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private constructions. However, unlike with respect to the White House, no documents attesting to the use of slave labor in the Monument's construction have been found.|$|R
5|$|The National Mall is a large, open park in {{downtown}} Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall {{is often the}} location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. The <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> and the Jefferson Pier are {{near the center of}} the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at the east end of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.|$|E
5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument,</b> the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the central tower of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{expected}} participants grew, the rally was moved from {{the grounds of the}} <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Monument</b> {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
