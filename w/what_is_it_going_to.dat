The answer, as we now know, is no, {{but the bottom line is}} that this episode finally gave us the Demon Dean moments we've been imagining.

From this meeting came a reciprocal friendship and a certain admiration of Lyautey for Charles. During this period Charles wrote the Meditations on the Holy Gospels. In April 1905, Commander Laperrine requested Charles de Foucauld to leave {{with him on a}} tour in the Hoggar. Having sought advice from the abbot Huvelin and Bishop Guerin, he participated in a new tour of supply. He started on June 8, 1905, continuing his prayer life while learning Tamahaq. On 25 Juin, 1905, they met amenokal (chef of the tribe) Moussa Ag Amastan, who decided to make an alliance with the French authority. Charles de Foucauld and Moussa Ag Amastan met and seemed to appreciate each other. Their meeting developed into a deep friendship.

5000|$|Following Cottle's long {{coaching}} tenure, Loyola hired Bill Dirrigl {{as their}} head coach. After four seasons Dirrigl was fired and Loyola graduate Charley Toomey {{took over as}} head coach in 2006. In both 2007 and 2008, Toomey led the Greyhounds to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. The 2010 and 2011 NCAA lacrosse championships were held at M&T Bank Stadium. Loyola, worked in conjunction with Johns Hopkins, Towson, and UMBC to run these events. The Hounds failed {{to advance to the}} 2009 NCAA lacrosse playoffs despite having the ninth place RPI, the third highest strength of schedule, and a 9-5 record. Instead Brown gained the slot because of their wins over Cornell and University of Massachusetts. Brown had an RPI of twelve, their schedule ranked a low of thirty six, and were ranked third in the Ivy League. Coach Toomey compared the 2009 Greyhound's dilemma to that of the 2006 Harvard squad saying, [...] "I can remember in 2006, Harvard gets in at 6-6, losing their last three games, and they said, ‘It’s not a numbers thing, it’s a strength-of-schedule thing.’ … So <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be? Is it going to be big wins or numbers? If it’s numbers, we look doggone good. If it’s about big wins, then we might be on the outside looking in." [...] Harvard made the tournament over Toomey's squad that season, the reason being that their 'big wins' were not as competitive as Harvard's record, RPI and SOS. RPI vs. Big wins has been a very large argument in the NCAA tournament selection process the past few years.|$|E

The key drivers for this change are global climate change, global peak oil and the massive overshoot of the renewable capacity of the world's natural systems (natural capital). The level of change required will need to be nothing less than revolutionary. Revolutionary not in an anarchic sense, but revolutionary in the way our whole way of living is directed, designed and structured in its relationship to the natural world around us, and the way we interact with it. The system changes required are beyond the scope of any one individual, organisation, community or region. It will require unified action, carefully targeted to best provide support to enable individuals to make all necessary changes to sustainable patterns of resource consumption to which they have 'control over', further to that needed to be implemented by Local and State Government services and infrastructure along with that of private industry and commerce. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take, to awaken in us the sea change in values about living systems that we so desperately need?"...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Due to the {{globalization}} and economic growth, both the U. S. and Chinese governments increased their investment in Chinese language education across the US, especially in K- 12 schools (Shi, 2010). This rapid development demands tremendous support, {{especially from the}} research on Chinese language learning and teaching. Unfortunately the {{research in this area}} is very limited, particularly on writing in Chinese. For those whose first language is alphabetical, writing in Chinese is tremendously difficult. Learners of Chinese usually do not compose writing until intermediate high level, before which learners usually learn to decode and write Chinese characters (Ke, 1998; Shen, 2005). Therefore the research on composing in Chinese is scarce and none at the beginning level. Gee believes that writing as a form of acquisition of literacy can be practiced in a very early stage (Gee, 2012). <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like if I introduce writing into beginning level curriculum? In order to explore this question and help fill the gap of research on writing, this ethnographic case study attempts to use sociocultural theories (Cope 2 ̆ 6 Kalantsz, 2000, 2009; Gee 2012; Kern, 2009; Norton, 2000; Norton 2 ̆ 6 Toohey 2004) and second language teaching and genre-based pedagogies to explore writing (composing) in Chinese as form of co-construction of text by beginning level students and teacher in an urban high school. Since no research on writing at this level was found, this study is exploratory. The goal is to investigate: 1) how do student’s identities revealed in the writing process affect her investment in writing and in the learning of the target language? 2) how do beginning level student and teacher co-construct texts with different genres using Chinese as foreign language? 3) what are the intertextualities and genre moves student uses to construct her writing (Bakhtin, 1982) ? The findings from this study will offer insights of creating more opportunities for learners to learn Chinese language, especially on composing in early learning stage. It is my hope that this study will contribute to the field of Chinese language learning in K- 12 level...|$|E
40|$|I {{have always}} been drawn to {{investigating}} the nature of ambiguous objects; objects whose role is unclear; objects that fall between distinct categories, and that exist in {{what appears to be}} transitional stages. The pieces I make provoke the imagination by building in experimental self-defined systems that refer to contemporary architecture, as well as comment on the ceramic and non-ceramic process. My pieces vary in form and intention just as the skyline carries changes in form and order. I want to make experimental objects that develop in front of me from the ground up, without a pre-planned result. Using fundamental elements and principles of design I use color, line, negative space, balance and composition {{to create a sense of}} tension, playful construction, and mysterious purpose in my work. The various apartments I’ve rented in Lincoln, Nebraska have all been ones with views of towers, cranes, and structures going up and coming down in all directions. The connection, or rather disconnect between interior and exterior when a building is structural and in progress is what interests me specifically. At this stage I am free to wonder what may become of this thing. What is it for? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become? These questions are answered only when the exterior is started and only if I am still able to watch the construction on a routine basis. Because of this relationship between interior and exterior I aim to construct work where facade and structure are indistinguishable. It is through this playful, unplanned process that a narration starts, showing the viewer each decision I’ve made throughout a piece down to the direction of each and every cut. However, I believe a piece is most successful when it asks the viewer to finish this story visually. The most intriguing objects both suggest and obscure their function simultaneously. I am asking questions about the conventions of ceramics through the use of shapes, surfaces, formats, and processes that come from outside of those conventions. To create, modify and manipulate material is as inherent as eating and breathing. Forever, man has modified conventions through the development and discovery of new processes and techniques. I have followed suit by using a combination of old and new building techniques in my own work. The orderly coils that create my work reflect both rigor and expression as I seek to describe my relationship with these constructions and the freedom I find within the design of an object. My work is, in part, defined by a combination of traditional and industrial ceramic applications as well as non-ceramic processes. Pieces speak to Ceramic tradition through the use of clay, glaze, and hand building techniques that refer to utility while I expand upon these traditions with additions of my own creations such as unique three-dimensionally printed dies that I combine with industrial processes such as the extruder or slip casting. Most builders and artists embrace new technologies. One of those technologies is the three dimensional printer which I use to produce the dies I extrude with as well as produce the prototypes from which I slip cast. This way of working allows me to modify and manipulate both material and technique. Color, scale, and presentation are carefully considered. I employ large areas of one color to contrast with another. These contrasting tonalities define both the elements and the structure of the sculptures. In industry, the colors of building materials are branding techniques for companies; I incorporate the same ideas looking for surfaces that are “mine” while reflecting those ideas. Unusually bright glazes or paints work adjacently to similar colors that are more dry and dull, which gives a viewer a sense of history to consider. All of the surfaces are integrated with their forms as if there is no relation between surface and form, but rather just one. The way in which I compose is directly related to the ideas found in avant-garde design. Relating ideas include building in original ways that transform the space the object rests in as well as making the viewer aware of the space they are inhabiting. Contemporary architectural feats, as evidenced in the Olympic building in China for example, drive me to build compositions with ideas relating to monumentality, remembrance, and landmark. Architects Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron (Herzog 2 ̆ 6 de Meuron), Stefan Marbach, Li Xinggang and artist Ai Weiwei worked jointly on the stadium. They created something that is purely form and structure. The inside is the outside and the materials needed for the construction were used in ways never seen before. Like this landmark, I create compositions that stem from an obsession to construct in unique and precarious ways that I don’t often see. When translated to art objects, they become unconventional compositions for myself as well as viewers to investigate. I’ve become fixated on these quirky and idiosyncratic building processes, as well as the playful, unplanned assembly of each piece that gives my work a sense of remnant. These fixations relate inherently to the freedom I see in contemporary design and architecture that exists all around me. It is my intention that as I build imaginatively each piece is connected with these ideas I carry. Advisor: Peter Pinnell 12 photographs are attached (below) as supplemental files...|$|E
