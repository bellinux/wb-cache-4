25|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{has long}} {{been aware of the}} work and {{theories}} of Professor Lowe and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> his statements scientifically sound. It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that we welcome proof of his genius. We shall follow the outcome of his plan with interest.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it {{desirable}} {{to avoid the}} term 'solution' altogether for the traffic problem is not such much a problem waiting for a solution as a social situation requiring {{to be dealt with}} by policies patiently applied over a period and revised {{from time to time in}} light of events.|$|E
60|$|We nodded. Even {{in our own}} humble {{life after}} our day's work <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> this true.|$|R
6000|$|DORA. Cardinal, indeed! If only Beatrice {{were here}} with her seven handmaids, that she might see what a fine eighth <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> for her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. See here." [...] He {{took out}} the charred {{fragment}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in the grate in Mrs. Inglethorp's room, {{and handed it to}} the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he <b>had</b> <b>found</b> it.|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{no signs}} of ivory-billed woodpeckers. No sightings, double knocks or calls, no replies to our many double-knock imitations. We have seen a few {{cavities}} of the appropriate size and shape for ivory-bills, but these can be old, or exceptionally large pileated woodpecker cavities, or mammal-enlarged pileated woodpecker cavities.… Given the results, it is unlikely a population of any meaningful size of ivory-billed woodpeckers exists in south Florida.|$|E
25|$|It {{is useful}} to compare the {{situation}} to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a free particle outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy E larger than the barrier height V0 will be slowed down but never reflected by the barrier, while a classical particle with E < V0 incident on the barrier from the left would always be reflected. Once <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the quantum-mechanical result we {{will return to the}} question of how to recover the classical limit.|$|E
25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{told him}} of my father's cruel death; of what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> to tell the horrible story, and before I had {{finished}} the tears were running down his cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{second and}} the secret was out, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> a great nugget of pure gold, four pounds of it or more. 'It's gold, lad,' I said, 'it's gold, or I'm a Dutchman!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, then, was {{the meaning}} of the little imp's token which he promised us?" [...] said Tressilian. [...] "Had we lingered near the spot, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> it a love-token with a vengeance." ...|$|R
500|$|One {{would have}} thought that claims dating back {{for more than a century}} and a half would have been barred long ago. As our opinion indicates, however, neither petitioners nor <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> any {{applicable}} statute of limitations or other relevant legal basis for holding that the Oneidas' claims are barred or otherwise have been satisfied.|$|E
500|$|Former Department of Homeland Security {{employee}} Philip Haney described Tablighi Jamaat {{as part of}} a [...] "trans-national Islamist network" [...] {{that was}} also affiliated with the Dar Al Uloom al Islamiyah mosque in San Bernardino, which terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook attended frequently. Assistant FBI Director Michael Heimbach said [...] "We have significant presence of Tablighi Jamaat in the United States and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that al Qaeda used them for recruiting." ...|$|E
500|$|Delivery by air {{lasted for}} less than a year. [...] In May 1930, the Newsboy was damaged by high winds while parked at the McCook airport. [...] Strunk opted not to repair it and return it to service, citing [...] "week after week of inclement weather, during which time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it {{impossible}} to fly our route on schedule". [...] The airplane was not yet built, he wrote, that could [...] "fly successfully in rain, wind, sleet, snow and fog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{she been}} very ill?" [...] asked Mr. Jarndyce {{of the gentleman}} whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in {{attendance}} on her. She answered for herself directly, though he had put the question in a whisper.|$|R
60|$|He {{came to his}} senses--that is to say, {{he opened}} his eyes and looked vacantly about him--between four and five hours after the time when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> him on the floor of the workshop.|$|R
60|$|So I told them, {{and when}} I {{came to the}} images that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> {{standing}} on the coffin, Iduna, who was paying little heed, stopped from her fondling of the necklace and asked where they were.|$|R
500|$|... "We protest {{before your}} Majesty {{and the whole}} world that until this great person be removed from {{intermeddling}} with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> those large supplies formerly and lately given." [...] Despite Parliament's protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.|$|E
500|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{these fish}} {{when they were}} {{too small to be}} worth cooking in the usual way, {{excellent}} when quite simply baked in the following manner, the flesh being remarkably sweet and tender, much more so than it becomes by frying or broiling. After they have been cleaned, dry them in a cloth, season the insides slightly with fine salt, dredge a little flour on the fish, and stick a few very small bits of butter on them, but only just sufficient to prevent their becoming dry in the oven; lay them singly on a flat dish, and bake them very gently from fourteen to sixteen minutes. Serve them with the same sauce as baked soles.|$|E
500|$|Other {{crew members}} accept the cancellation, but Shatner and Nimoy try {{to hang on}} to their Star Trek personae as Kirk and Spock. However, Nimoy is {{eventually}} reduced to a sobbing, nervous wreck, and is carried off the set. Shatner remains defiantly in the Captain's chair, as Herb Goodman mentions to Shatner he {{got a phone call from}} a margarine company. Finally, the set is completely dismantled, and still in his chair, Shatner, as Captain Kirk, makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration, concluding: [...] "And except for one television network, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> intelligence everywhere in the galaxy." [...] Raising his hand in the Vulcan salute, he goes on, [...] "Live long and prosper". Then he brings his fingers together, his hand still raised, and adds, [...] "Promise".|$|E
60|$|There was no moving her--there {{was nothing}} more to be said. I signed to Penelope to come away with me. We left her, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> her, {{sweeping}} the corridor, like {{a woman in a}} dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{leave it}} to you if somethin' of the kind don't seem reasonable," [...] the old man replied, grimly, and then he set about making a dinner from the supply of {{provisions}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in the ravine.|$|R
60|$|At {{night we}} all came {{together}} to see what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got; and it appeared <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found,</b> in that day's heap of earth, about fifty pounds' weight of gold dust, and about thirty-four pounds' weight more in {{all the rest of}} our works in the river.|$|R
500|$|On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying [...] "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [...] found no evidence that anyone higher [...] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind it}} was to [...] "make available to the general public, {{in a way that}} was easy to absorb, those aspects of psychological knowledge <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> most helpful ourselves towards making life more understandable, meaningful, and enjoyable".|$|R
6000|$|... "John," [...] I said, [...] "I {{have brought}} you some {{property}} which I {{think you have}} lost," [...] and I handed him the morocco-bound Christian Year and the water-colour drawing which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in the sacked mission house at Kilwa.|$|R
6000|$|Said Media, [...] "Had {{we arrived}} at Willamilla in the morning, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> Donjalolo and his court in the eastern village; but being afternoon, we must travel farther, and seek him in his western retreat; for that {{is now in the}} shade." ...|$|R

2500|$|Clay {{and stone}} tablets {{unearthed}} at Harappa, which were carbon dated 3300–3200BC., contain trident-shaped and plant-like markings. [...] "It {{is a big}} question as to if we can call what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> true writing, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> symbols that have similarities to what became Indus script" [...] said Dr. Richard Meadow of Harvard University, Director of the Harappa Archeological Research Project. This primitive writing is placed slightly earlier than primitive writings of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia, dated c.3100BC. These markings have similarities to what later became Indus Script.|$|E

5000|$|Weeks later, after major {{efforts and}} disappointments, Capra located {{hard-to-reach}} archives within government facilities, and by avoiding normal channels {{was able to}} gain access: [...] Peterson and I walked away on air. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the great cache of enemy films—and it was ours! ...|$|R
60|$|I agreed heartily with him, {{and then}} I {{told him what}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> in his absence, that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him.|$|R
60|$|Passing {{down that}} splendid apartment, which {{an hour later}} had ceased to exist, lamps in hand, for these <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> time to fetch and light, we reached {{the mouth of the}} passage that led to the {{underground}} city without meeting a single human being.|$|R
