Although mining does not occur in these washes, storm water runoff from areas disturbed by mining activities could potentially degrade the quality of water going into them.

Water quality is monitored and controlled at these ponds, {{as well as at}} livestock watering ponds, seeps and storm water runoff.

2500|$|Chester Borough {{split from}} Chester Township in 1930 over the {{creation}} of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township {{did not wish to}} financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the NJ State Plan and codified in the Highlands <b>Water</b> <b>Protection</b> Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the [...] Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment.
