5|$|The jacket {{prescribed}} for infantry use {{was of the}} same design for all service men. The design itself depended entirely on the region, time, {{and the source of}} fabrics. The Eastern Theater uniform jacket was the Richmond Depot design, with three primary types issued throughout the war. The jacket varied from a cadet gray, piped and trimmed jacket, looking much like a pre-war militia jacket, to the jeans-cloth jacket that was worn out in six months. The materials and uniforms imported from England were also issued to the troops through this facility. The Western and Deep Southern facilities manufactured similar uniforms, being jeans-cloth, dyed with vegetable based grays, that would fade to brown or tan. The typical jackets issued had 5-7 button fronts, <b>with</b> <b>collar</b> and cuff trim that varied from era, region and source, and an outside pocket on occasion.|$|E

25|$|The President of Finland is {{the grand}} {{master of the}} Order of the White Rose. According to the protocol, the {{president}} shall wear the Grand Cross of the White Rose <b>with</b> <b>collar</b> on formal occasions. The original design of the collar, decorated with 9 swastikas, dates from 1918, and was designed by the artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president Urho Kekkonen in 1963 after it became known that the President of France Charles De Gaulle was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.|$|E

50|$|A {{research}} project involves fitting cougars, the top predator in the park, <b>with</b> GPS radio <b>collars</b> and tracking their movements. Simultaneously vicuñas, {{one of their}} main prey animals, are being fitted <b>with</b> <b>collars</b> to monitor their behaviour. It {{has been found that}} in areas of the park with plenty of cover, such as canyons and wetlands, the vicuñas are much more alert to danger and consequently spend less time feeding than they do on open plains. This alters the composition of the plant species present with a resulting increase in invertebrates and in biodiversity. There are plans to fit some condors <b>with</b> <b>collars</b> to find out to what extent they benefit from an increase in the frequency of vicuña kills.|$|R
