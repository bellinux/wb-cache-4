50|$|Parcels {{of land in}} Eastfield {{were found}} to have been {{contaminated}} by chromium waste from the <b>Whites</b> <b>Chemical</b> Works, the most conspicuous of which was a large play area made from a filled-in quarry at the end of Dukes Road; this stood empty and fenced-off {{for a number of years}} before the waste was eradicated, and now modern apartments and a new landscaped park (Quarryfield) occupies the site.|$|R
50|$|With {{the first}} rains {{after the initial}} explosions, coming on 18 August, <b>white</b> <b>chemical</b> foam covered the streets. Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on {{sensitive}} skin parts after coming into contact with rain droplets. However, meteorologists sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.|$|R
5000|$|White {{was born}} in 1812 at Shawfield House in Rutherglen which {{at that time was}} a rural country estate {{on the banks of the}} River Clyde. However in 1820 his father John and his uncle James had {{established}} a chemicals enterprise (J & J <b>White</b> <b>Chemicals)</b> in the area, and in the subsequent decades the business expanded to become dominant in the industry with its facilities spread over the whole of the Shawfield district.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, surveys {{carried out on}} blaes playing fields due to be built on for a nursing home {{revealed}} dangerously high levels of hexavalent chromium. Further investigations confirmed that J & J <b>White</b> <b>Chemicals</b> had been routinely discarding up to 2.5 million tonnes of their waste materials (Chromate Ore Processing Residue, COPR) at locations around Rutherglen, Cambuslang and Glasgow (such as Carmyle) for many years, {{and at the time}} this was permitted.These sites were often old quarries or mines requiring suitable landfill for reuse.|$|R
50|$|J & J <b>White</b> <b>Chemicals,</b> also {{referred}} to as Shawfield Chemical Works', was established in 1820 by James White I and John White I after a soap business on the same site, in which John White (I) was a partner from 1810, had failed. John White I had also purchased Shawfield estate and its policies including Shawfield House and Hayfield, and in the following years the business flourished, particularly in the manufacture of bichromate of potash, with their premises expanding over the previously rural estate.|$|R
50|$|Rutherglen was a {{centre of}} heavy industry, having a long coal mining {{tradition}} which died out by 1950. J&J <b>White's</b> <b>Chemical</b> Works (later ACC Chrome & Chemicals) in Shawfield, {{which was in}} existence from 1820 to 1967, produced more than 70% of the UK's Chromate products including chromic acid, chromic oxide pigment, sodium and potassium chromate and dichromate. Today {{there is a significant}} legacy of soluble chromium (VI) waste in the area. Rutherglen, and most of the other towns encircling the city, are dormitory suburbs of Glasgow.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{detectors}} (“sensors”) usually {{consist of}} a two-dimensional array of receptors exposed to the solution to be tested, from whose output the bulk solution concentration of the analyte of interest can be determined. Both input and output—the number of analyte particles striking the array in a given interval of time, and the number captured—are countable events. The gain is the quotient of these two numbers, and the detectivity the quotient of their fluctuations. The gain and detectivity provide a universal framework for comparing different types of sensors, and in which the desirable properties of sensors, e. g. their ability to detect very weak signals (“sensitivity”), and to detect the analyte {{in the presence of}} a large excess of other molecules (“selectivity”), can be related to various physico-chemical parameters such as the packing density and size of receptors, and their affinity for the analyte. Analyte multivalence, although formally a source of inefficiency, is very useful for making the sensor more resistant to spurious chemical noise. An important result is that <b>chemical</b> <b>fog</b> engendered by a huge excess of nonspecifically binding particles has no effect on the detectivity, provided that the nonspecific interaction is reversible...|$|R
5000|$|Chrystal {{was educated}} at The Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University. After {{working in a}} {{laboratory}} in the 1870s he joined J & J <b>White</b> <b>Chemicals</b> as an expert chemist, and after his uncle John died in 1881 he became the technical partner in the business. By this time Chrystal’s cousin John Campbell White, the son of his other uncle James, was also a partner. After the death of James White in 1884, another cousin Hill Hamilton Barrett became the commercial partner. At this time the Shawfield works, mainly producing bichromate of potash, were the largest of their kind {{in the world and}} employed over 500 men. Chrystal was credited with improving the manufacturing processes for the products.|$|R
50|$|White {{was born}} at Hayfield, near Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, the only son of James White of Overtoun (1812-1884), by Fanny Campbell, {{daughter}} of Alexander Campbell, of Barnhill, Dunbartonshire, Sheriff of Renfrewshire. He had six sisters. His father was originally a lawyer, who had left the legal profession to join John & James <b>White,</b> <b>chemical</b> manufacturers, a firm founded by his father and uncle at Rutherglen in 1810. James Smith was chief administrator of the fund {{set up for the}} sufferers of the City of Glasgow Bank collapse in 1878. After his death citizens of Glasgow erected a statue of James White at Cathedral Square, Glasgow. John White was educated at Stow's Academy, Glasgow, and at the University of Glasgow. He won prizes in both logic and natural philosophy. He came into close contact with William Thomson, the future Lord Kelvin, and worked in his laboratory for a year.|$|R
50|$|In 1859, James White, {{a retired}} {{lawyer and a}} {{co-owner}} of the J & J <b>White</b> <b>Chemical</b> Works in Rutherglen, bought Overtoun Farm {{with the purpose of}} building a mansion there. He intended for it to be a country retreat, and initially acquired 900 acre; he soon increased this to 2000 acre. White hired the Glasgow-based architect James Smith (1808-1863) (father of the murder suspect Madeleine Smith) to design and construct the house. A farmhouse on the site was demolished {{to make way for the}} mansion. Overtoun House was built between 1860 and 1863, though Smith died before work was completed, and the house was completed by one of his partners. White's family began living in the mansion in 1862. It is recorded that the grounds were laid out by Mr C Kemp of Birkenhead, which is thought to refer to the landscape gardener Edward Kemp (1817-1891), who was superintendent of Birkenhead Park for Joseph Paxton.|$|R
50|$|Lead(II) acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2), {{also known}} as lead acetate, lead diacetate, plumbous acetate, sugar of lead, lead sugar, salt of Saturn, or Goulard's powder, is a <b>white</b> {{crystalline}} <b>chemical</b> compound with a sweetish taste. It is made by treating lead(II) oxide with acetic acid. Like other lead compounds, it is toxic. Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin. With water it forms the trihydrate, Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, a colourless or white efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance.|$|R
40|$|During a {{study of}} the {{distribution}} of injected titanium dioxidO in the rat, small clusters of abdominal lymph nodes, here designated celiac, were found to be intensely <b>white.</b> <b>Chemical</b> analysis revealed that TiO 2 was present in higher concentration in these lymph nodes than in any other anatomical structure. With time the concentration of TiO ~ increased progressively and remarkably in these lymph nodes; often it exceeded by more than 10 times that in the cells of the second rank. Why does this extraordinary accumulation of TiO, take place selectively in celiac lymph nodes? Titanium dioxide was first employed in biological experiments in {{a study of}} symmetry of bone marrow (1) in the extremities of dog and rabbit. TiO 2 has many advantages in chemical investigation of scavenging by cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Titanium occurs in tissues of normal animals but only in trace mounts (2, 3). TiO 2 is insoluble in aqueous solutions; it is chemically unreactive in biological systems; it is not radioactive; it is not radio-opaque; it is not costly. Stable suspensions of TiO 2 in fine particulate form are easily prepared...|$|R
40|$|Three {{scenario}} {{projections for}} future market potentials of biobased bulk chemicals produced {{by means of}} white biotechnology are developed for Europe (EU- 25) until the year 2050, and potential nonrenewable energy savings, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and land use consequences are analyzed. These scenarios assume benign, moderate, and disadvantageous conditions for biobased chemicals. The scenario analysis yields {{a broad range of}} values for the possible market development of <b>white</b> biotechnology <b>chemicals,</b> that is, resulting in a share of <b>white</b> biotechnology <b>chemicals</b> relative to all organic chemicals of about 7 (or 5 million tonnes), 17. 5 (or 26 million tonnes), or 38 % (or 113 million tonnes) in 2050. We conclude that, under favorable conditions, white biotechnology enables substantial savings of nonrenewable energy use (NREU) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to the energy use of the future production of all organic chemicals from fossil resources. Savings of NREU reach up to 17 % for starch crops and up to 31 % for lignocellulosic feedstock by 2050, and saving percentages for GHG emissions are in a similar range. Parallel to these environmental benefits, economic advantages of up to 75 billion € production cost savings arise...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the morphology of fibers and its mechanical properties, images were obtained by visual examination and micro-morphology analysis. A visual examination of bamboo strips (Fig.  1) clearly demonstrates that the natural pale yellow of the strips gradually turns <b>white</b> throughout <b>chemical</b> treatment, indicating a significant removal of lignin. The change in color directly reflects changes in the constituents of bamboo fibers, in which a light brown color generally indicates the presence of lignin while white fibers generally indicate holocellulose. The additional treatment of acidified NaClO 2 and NaOH combined with the freeze-drying method also resulted in air voids inside the cell wall because of the removal of hemicellulose and lignin.|$|R

40|$|Aluminium is a bluish or silvery <b>white</b> <b>chemical</b> element {{from the}} boron group. In the {{aluminium}} industry, {{the quality of}} alumina, aluminium ore are commonly assessed {{on the basis of}} an important parameter called attrition index (Yang, 2003). Attrition index indicates / signifies chipping affinity of minerals under impact. The attrition index attempts to quantify the tendency of the alumina to break down during handling and produce fines. Alumina particle with a poor attrition index produces more dust, leading to loss of product and environmental pollution during handling and leads to problems in alumina smelters. Attrition property of a particle depends upon its physical, mechanical, metallurgical and chemical properties. Attrition is affected by many variables like size, shape, surface, porosity, hardness, cracks, time, velocity, pressure, shear, temperature, etc. Strength of alumina is currently measured using so called Forsythe technique. Forsythe technique involves producing a fluidized column of alumina in a standardized arrangement and measuring the change in the mass of particles < 45 fl m over a set period of time. In this paper an attempt has been made to evaluate the strength of alumina based on single impact using the newly designed and built experimental rig at CQUniversity Australia. The set-up developed at CQUniversity was based on the approach used by Ghadiri and Bentham et al to evaluate the strength of paracetamol. This method used a glass tube to funnel particles towards a target for a single impact event. Once the particles leave the target material, they are collected on filter paper and sized. The particles are driven by a vacuum behind the filter (Audet & Clegg, 2008). This paper proposes to extend the work further and develop a more fundamental understanding of alumina particle breakage during single impact. The output of the research works would be helpful for alumina refineries/industries as well as for environmental agencies to understand more accurately the pollution levels caused by the refineries...|$|R
