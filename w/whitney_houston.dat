5|$|Mottola {{had assumed}} the top {{position}} at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through {{various stages of}} change. One he felt was {{very important for the}} label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival <b>Whitney</b> <b>Houston</b> from Arista Records, or a pop star to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my <b>Whitney</b> <b>Houston</b> record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who noted {{it as an}} essential addition in Madonna's repertoire.

It also {{reached the top of}} the charts in Canada, Finland, Italy and Sweden, while reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Even though the song was commercially successful, Madonna has never performed it in any of her concert tours, nor included it on her greatest hits albums, GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009).|$|E

5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists <b>Whitney</b> <b>Houston</b> and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E
5|$|The single premiered on Chris Moyles's breakfast show on 7 September on BBC Radio 1. On Sunday 18 October 2009 {{the song}} was {{released}} for digital download in the UK.

It consisted of a sheer bodysuit, a red military jacket with black epaulettes {{as well as other}} details, black harem trousers and Alexander Wang boots. The outfit itself was subject to media attention, with some reporting that online debates had drawn comparisons to the outfit worn by 1992 video game antagonist M. Bison from the Street Fighter series. Media also considered Cole's outfit and performance inspired by Janet Jackson. Media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that Cole denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance.

5000|$|The {{commercial}} success of Rhythm Nation 1814 was an unexpected achievement for mainstream pop music. Although Jackson was told focusing her albums theme on social consciousness would negatively impact sales, it was [...] "a prediction soon proved wrong when {{the album was}} certified multi-platinum" [...] and subsequently topped the pop, R&B and dance music charts. In She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul (2003), Lucy OBrien wrote that contrary to A&Ms fear that the album would underperform, its multi-platinum sales pushed Jackson {{to a level of}} superstardom rivaling her brother Michael, calling it a [...] "personal manifesto" [...] and regarding it as a female counterpart to Marvin Gayes Whats Going On (1971). Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007), wrote that the album [...] "may remind some of Sly Stone prior to Theres a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people." [...] It made history as the only album to generate seven top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing Michael Jacksons Thriller (1982) and Bruce Springsteens Born in the U.S.A. (1984), each having seven top ten hits. It is also the only album to achieve number one hits in three separate calendar years, with [...] "Miss You Much" [...] in 1989, [...] "Escapade" [...] and [...] "Black Cat" [...] in 1990, and [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] in 1991.

5000|$|Singer <b>Whitney</b> <b>Houstons</b> {{enormous}} {{popularity in}} the 1980s gave audiences {{a chance to see}} John Simmons in action during events such as the Moment of Truth World Tour. This conquest of the international pop music audience took place in 1987 and 1988, the last years of Simmons life, but as a keyboardist as well as an excellent vocalist himself, Simmons was Houstons musical director and backup bandleader, an assignment he had also previously carried out for Stephanie Mills. Simmons had his own taste of chart success {{as a member of the}} Reflections, a vocal group formed in New York City in the early 1970s. His background was in gospel, a talent that logically helped push him into R&B waters, as in the case of many other performers in these related styles. Soulful singer Melba Moore wanted a vocal group who could hold forth with credibility during a special gospel section of her live show, settling on Simmons and colleagues including his brother Edmund Simmons. The Reflections wound up touring with Moore for more than three years. The group then began recording on its own for the Capitol label. [...] "Three Steps from True Love" [...] became a hit, but the only one the group managed to have while active. [...] "Shes My Summer Breeze," [...] upon what would have to be described as subsequent Reflections, eventually turned trendy on the British rare groove scene. Simmons discography also includes sideman appearances on recordings by Mills and Peggi Blu. His greatest stretch seems to have taken place on a Leadbelly tribute concert produced by avant-garde jazz composer Heiner Stadler.|$|R
