Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in Cymbeline.|$|E

After President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) goes back on his promise to make Frank Secretary of State, Frank enlists Claire {{to help him get}} revenge and propel them both to positions of power.

Jolie further wrote, [...] "On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity." ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 December 1936, Edward made a BBC radio {{broadcast}} from Windsor Castle; having abdicated, {{he was introduced}} by Sir John Reith as [...] "His Royal Highness Prince Edward". The official address had been polished by Churchill and was moderate in tone, speaking about Edward's inability {{to do his job}} [...] "as I would have wished" [...] without the support of [...] "the <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love". Edward's reign had lasted 327days, the shortest of any British monarch since the disputed reign of Lady Jane Grey over 380years earlier. The day following the broadcast he left Britain for Austria.|$|E
500|$|The King's {{desire to}} marry {{a woman who had}} two living ex-husbands {{threatened}} to cause a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom and the Dominions, and ultimately led to his abdication in December 1936 to marry [...] "the <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love". After abdicating, the former king was created Duke of Windsor by his brother and successor, King George VI. Edward married Wallis six months later, after which she was formally known as the Duchess of Windsor, without the style [...] "Her Royal Highness". She was instead styled as [...] "Her Grace", a style normally reserved for non-royal dukes and duchesses.|$|E
500|$|The King {{signed the}} Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, in the {{presence}} of his three surviving brothers, the Duke of York (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the Dominions finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, {{explained}} his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, [...] "I have {{found it impossible to}} carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> love." [...] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heiress presumptive.|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{animosity}} {{between the two}} men was their competition for the attention of the poet Frances Sargent Osgood in the mid to late 1840s. While both she and Poe were still married to their respective spouses, the two carried on a public flirtation that resulted in much gossip among the literati. Griswold, who was smitten with Osgood, escorted her to literary salons and became her staunchest defender. [...] "She is in all things the most admirable <b>woman</b> <b>I</b> ever knew", he wrote to publisher James T. Fields in 1848. Osgood responded by dedicating a collection of her poetry to Griswold, [...] "as a souvenir of admiration for his genius, of regard for his generous character, and of gratitude for his valuable literary counsels".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Phoebe Green was {{considered as a}} recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance. Chris Carter explained the character's origins, saying [...] "I thought {{it was interesting to}} show a little bit of Mulder's history by bringing an old girlfriend back. I've always wanted to do a Scotland Yard detective who was a <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> also thought it was an interesting chance to use Amanda Pays and make a villainess of her". Executive producer Robert Goodwin felt that the episode [...] "was a hard one. Any kind of a fire stunt is a major undertaking, because it involves so many overlapping things. It was a major feat, a real logical and creative feat, because you wanted it to look good".|$|E

500|$|Discussing Rose's {{increased}} role in {{the second}} season, after making brief guest appearances in the first, Fazekas stated that the opportunity presented itself to [...] "bring [...] out to L.A." [...] for the second season, in order for Carter to have another person to talk to, [...] "who knows her secrets and {{knows a lot about}} what's going on." [...] Boone called Rose [...] "a little bit of a bestie," [...] trying to get information from Carter and Sousa to help [...] "move things along" [...] since she sees an attraction between the two. For the second season, Rose goes into the field, with Boone saying, [...] "She gets recruited and she is [...] herself excited that she gets {{to go out there and}} be a bad <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> think she’s quite capable." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{after the}} Beatles {{released}} Lennon's [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] and [...] "Real Love", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney {{and his family}} collaborated with her and Sean to create the song [...] "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Of Ono, McCartney stated: [...] "I {{thought she was a}} cold <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." [...] Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time, and when Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan married twice, was widowed {{once and}} has five {{children}} and three grandchildren. Brosnan met Australian actress Cassandra Harris through her stepson David Harris, one of Richard Harris's nephews, in 1977, {{shortly after he}} left drama school. On meeting her, he has described his feelings, saying, [...] "What a beautiful looking <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> never for an instant thought she was someone I'd spend 17 {{years of my life}} with. I didn't think of wooing her, or attempting to woo her; I just wanted to enjoy her beauty and who she was." [...] They began dating, and eventually bought a house in Wimbledon. They married on 27 December 1980 and had one son together, Sean, who was born on 13 September 1983. They lived with her children, Charlotte (1971-2013) and Chris, and after their father Dermot Harris died in 1986, he adopted them and they took the surname Brosnan.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a <b>woman,</b> <b>I</b> think. I'm just devastated for her". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, [...] "Most of Becky’s storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere, but with this one {{it was just like}} a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|Most significant, from Phillips' own {{point of}} view, is her exposé of the [...] "Boys' Club" [...] {{in the higher}} echelons of Hollywood, where she claimed it was her gender that led to her {{ultimate}} ostracism. [...] "If I had been a man, they would have closed ranks around me", she said, referring to her drug addiction. [...] "They hated the woman thing. And I wasn't even regarded as a <b>woman,</b> <b>I</b> was a girl." [...] Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as: [...] "you [...] guys don't take women seriously; you like us around... we aren't allowed to be players". Those same few men, like [...] "Valley viper" [...] Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency were, in her eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{the songs}} from the album explore social issues. The songs [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lush" [...] and [...] "Too Famous" [...] use satire to criticise the {{superior}} attitudes of male musicians, while [...] "Husband" [...] disapproves [...] "gruff and pushy" [...] boyfriends. The band also clarified that they have nothing against men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E
