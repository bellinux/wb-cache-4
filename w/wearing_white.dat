5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese <b>wearing</b> <b>white</b> headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon with the majority of the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, <b>wearing</b> <b>white</b> dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July that Scott {{would be taking}} command, hoped to bring the war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. <b>Wearing</b> <b>white</b> headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E

5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer <b>wearing</b> <b>white</b> clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes into her room to see her.

A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, <b>wearing</b> <b>white</b> clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras zoom in on Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear <b>wearing</b> <b>white</b> leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E
