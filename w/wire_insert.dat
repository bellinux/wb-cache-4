40|$|The present {{project work}} on “Experimental Studies on Heat Transfer Augmentation Using Galvanised Iron <b>Wire</b> <b>Insert</b> With and Without Baffles” was {{undertaken}} {{with a view}} to increase the effective thermal performance of heat exchangers. Every commercial, industrial and domestic application, where conversion or utilization of energy is involved, requires a heat exchange process. In the present project work, the effect of addition of GI <b>wire</b> <b>insert</b> with and without baffles, in the flow path of liquid was investigated. This project deals with the using four Twisted Galvanised Iron (GI) wires with and without baffles, as passive augmentation device. By introduction of these inserts in the flow path of liquid in the inner tube of the heat exchanger the effect of turbulence on Nusselt number was observed. It was compared with the values for smooth tube. The effect of baffles made of tin was also taken into account and a comparative study was {{made on the basis of}} varying baffle space. All the results and readings were compared with the standard data from the smooth tube. The Nusselt number was found to increase with decreasing baffle space. The 4 <b>wire</b> <b>insert</b> with baffle space 6 cm was found to be the most efficient among all the configurations used...|$|E

40|$|This project work, “Experimental {{studies on}} {{pressure}} drop for flow through tubes using Galvanised Iron <b>wire</b> <b>insert</b> {{with and without}} baffles” was undertaken in a view of studying the effect of turbulence on pressure drop of a heat exchanger. Most of the commercial, domestic and industrial applications where conversion or utilisation of energy is involved require a heat exchange process. This project deals {{with the introduction of}} three and four Galvanised Iron wires with and without baffles as passive augmentation device. The baffles used in the experiment were made up of thin tin sheets. By introduction of these inserts in the flow path of liquid in the inner tube of heat exchanger the effect of turbulence on pressure drop was observed. It was compared with the value of smooth tube. The effect of baffle was also taken into account and a comparative study was {{made on the basis of}} varying baffle space (â= 24, 12 & 6 cm). The flow rate was varied from 350 - 1250 litres/hour. All the readings and results were compared with the standard data from the smooth tube. The friction factor for inserts without baffles was in range of 1. 31 - 4. 28 and with baffles was in range of 2. 38 - 21. 87. The pressure drop reading was found to increase with decreasing baffle space. The friction factor was highest for the four <b>wire</b> <b>insert</b> with 6 cm baffle spacing...|$|E
40|$|A semiautomatic grinder was {{designed}} and built at Mound Laboratory to grind molded plastic detonator heads to close tolerances. It uses a vertical spindle, dry grinding technique to decrease grinding time of some diallyl phthalate (DAP) detonator heads with <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> and to eliminate the problem of error in repeatability which is characteristic of the manual grinding process. The semiautomatic grinder is essentially air-operated with electrical control and was primarily designed using standard components for ease of manufacture and maintenance. As development of the semiautomatic grinder progressed, DAP detonator heads with <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> ground using the manual surface grinder were evaluated along with {{the same type of}} detonator heads ground using the semiautomatiac grinder. Also, a time study was conducted to determine the cost savings of grinding miniature DAP detonator heads with <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> using the semiautomatic grinder. Inspection and analytical results and radiographic sections of ground detonator head surfaces from each grinding technique indicated that the semiautomatic grinding technique provides acceptable ground DAP detonator heads with <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> at a cost savings of 83. 5 % and a significant reduction in grinding time...|$|R

40|$|A new {{electrospray}} tip with a <b>wire</b> <b>insert</b> {{was tested}} and {{compared with the}} conventional bare fused silica capillary tip. The new tip combined the approach of conventional fused silica spray tips with those containing metal wires. Here, we used a floating wire so that the tips could be prepared and replaced more easily. With the conventional tip, the electrospray process became unstable and the spray current fluctuated significantly {{in the presence of}} an air bubble. When the wire-inserted tip was used under the same conditions, much less signal deterioration occurred. The superior performance of this tip over the conventional tip was attributable to its enhanced electric conduction. The new tip has great potential for improving signal stability in LC mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effect of Si {{content of}} Al-Si matrix on roll cast <b>wire</b> <b>inserted</b> strip was {{investigated}} in this paper. 99. 5 %Al, Al- 4 %Si, Al- 12 %Si and Al- 18 %Si were used as matrix. Slit depth of the nozzle, superheat of melt, wire-diameter and roll speed {{was chosen as the}} casting parameters, too. Addition of the Si was useful to prevent the reaction between the matrix and the wire. A downward melt drag twin roll caster could cast the <b>wire</b> <b>inserted</b> strip of the Al-Si matrix of which Si content was ranging up to 18 %. Composite strip, which matrix was hyper eutectic Al- 18 %Si, could be cast at the speeds up to 20 m/min. The gap between the wire and matrix became thin when the superheat was high. When the slit depth of the nozzle was too shallow, the wire could not be inserted in the strip. The thickness of the <b>wire</b> <b>inserted</b> strip became thinner as the roll speed became higher...|$|R

30|$|Although many use crossed pin fixation, {{controversy}} persists {{regarding the}} number of Kirschner wires {{to be used for}} fixation. A greater number of <b>wires</b> <b>inserted</b> in each of the epicondyles may offer more stability, but multiple entry points over a small cartilaginous area would increase the chances of skin nipping, nerve entrapment, and pin-tract infections.|$|R

40|$|The present {{experimental}} work {{are carried out}} with copper twisted tape inserts 3 mm with 5. 2, 4. 2 and 3. 2 twists respectively. The inserts when placed {{in the path of}} the flow of the fluid, create a high degree of turbulence resulting in an increase in the heat transfer rate and the pressure drop. The work includes the determination of friction factor and heat transfer coefficient for various twisted <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> with varying twists and different materials. The Reynolds number is varied from 5000 to 16000. Correlations for Nusselt number and friction factor are developed for the twisted <b>wire</b> <b>inserts</b> from the obtained results.

30|$|An {{incomplete}} V-shaped osteotomy {{was implemented}} as planned preoperatively using a power saw with preservation of a medial bony hinge {{at the apex}} of the osteotomy to be completed manually like osteoclasis. After wedge removal, the osteotomy site was closed by abducting the lower limb and manipulating the proximal fragment {{with the aid of a}} strong <b>wire</b> <b>inserted</b> as a joystick helping manipulation of this short segment producing the required correction. Now, the first transfixing K <b>wire</b> was <b>inserted</b> from proximal lateral direction pointing at and engaging the medial or posterior cortex of distal fragment at least 2  cm distal to the osteotomy site (Fig.  4 c) and a second wire—at least—was inserted and checked with the image intensifier (Fig.  4 d, e).|$|R
