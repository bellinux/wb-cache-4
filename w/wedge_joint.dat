Rice, cotton, canola oil, green ramie, Italian aspens, various fishes from the Dongting lake, fleshes {{are the major}} {{products}} in the county. The settle-in of Zoomlion industrial park is deemed as a milestone for the industry development in this county. It brings as well {{a large amount of}} jobs to this region. Raw agricultural products are processed by some local companies and exported abroad, for example, onions are cooked and canned to export to Japan by private JiaodeChang, Italian aspens are fabricated by private Guozhen Wooden Co. into shining fire-resistant <b>wedge</b> <b>joint</b> board for house construction in North America. Other state-owned factories such as paper-making company, spinning mill went into bankruptcy several years ago due to environmental pollutions, corruption and low efficiency to compete in the market. Industry in this country is developing gradually with vast configuration change. The eastern part of the county is protected by the state law as a wet land conservation area. Thousands of acres of reeds sprawl across the wet land. Thanks to the enforcement of state law, the ecological system is minimally disturbed by anthropogenic activities in the conservation area and hosts hundreds types of fishes, birds and wild animals. A lot of tourists are attracted to the Western Dongting Lake National Wet Land Park to enjoy the peace and harmony of nature of Dongting Lake.|$|E

40|$|The notched <b>wedge</b> <b>joint</b> {{design has}} proven to be the {{preferred}} method of joint construction by research studies given the obvious benefits of higher density, reduced permeability and greater edge confinement when compared to traditional joint methods. Greater quality of joints and improved pavement performance is evident in states that specify the joint type, but not without careful quality control during the construction process. Pavements exhibit longitudinal joint cracking as early as three years into the service life of a roadway, exposing the pavement to damage and costly repairs, or total replacement. Workmanship determines the quality of the finished joint and good construction is the only means to reduce permeability caused by low densities. The notched <b>wedge</b> <b>joint</b> design seems to ensure higher densities and less potential for failure. Prior to this study, contractor input was rarely solicited by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) or by the industry as a whole. State roadway projects were chosen based on DOT collected information, and contractor representatives were surveyed to gain a greater understanding of the contractor perspective and process. The survey results exhibited many commonalities in method as well as differences in opinions and unique practices supported by industry research. This information was analyzed and used to propose specification revisions and to develop recommendations for a joint density testing process for performance data collection...|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which an {{organosilane}} surface treatment regime can promote durability enhancement of an adhesively bonded aluminium alloy system has been determined. Results have revealed the range of application and film-conditioning parameters which contribute to joint durability in a simple Boeing <b>wedge</b> <b>joint.</b> Organosilane solution parameters relating to solvent type, solution concentration, pH and hydrolysis time have all been shown to influence resultant durability. Interestingly, parameters such as film drying temperature and in-process time delay (time interval between application of the organosilane to the alloy surface and subsequent bonding) have little influence on joint performance. The factors responsible for the durability variations observed have been considered using various surface analytical techniques. Superficially, failure surfaces indicative of interfacial failure between substrate and adhesive have been observed. More detailed characterisation using both XPS and SIMS has indicated failure processes associated with a 'diffusion zone' comprising aluminium oxide and the organosilane.

50|$|The Yoke and Rack {{construction}} differs critically in the {{way that}} the legs of the piece are joined to the horizontal portion (be it tabletop, seat or cabinet carcass) using a type of <b>wedged</b> mortise-and-tenon <b>joint</b> where the end grain of the leg is visible as a circle in the frame of the tabletop. The cross-pieces (stretchers in the western equivalent) are joined through mortise-and-tenon joinery as well. The legs and stretchers are commonly round rather than square or curvilinear. The simplest pieces are simply four splayed legs attached to a solid top, but more complicated pieces contain decorative brackets, drawers and metal latches.

[...] Early chairs made in America usually have stretchers connecting {{the front and back}} legs and a cross stretcher connecting the two side stretchers, creating what is known as an [...] "H" [...] stretcher assembly. A common misconception about this assembly is that the stretchers hold the legs together in order to keep them from pulling apart. In the traditional Windsor design, the <b>wedged</b> tenon <b>joint</b> which joins each leg to the seat is strong enough in itself to prevent the legs from creeping outward. The stretcher system actually pushes the legs apart to retain the necessary tension which reduces slack.|$|R

The tracked vehicle is manufactured by BAE Systems Hägglunds AB in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The differential gear has a bolted house. The differential meets the requirement specifications, {{but the problem is}} that the bolts are sheared off because of the extreme torque that the differential is exposed to resist. Previous report on the differential show pictures of bolts which have been sheared off at the threads. This report is also includes three lists that explain seven different proposals which some are approved and some are not, and the report also presents the force, tensile, and shear stress. In a bolted connection there is both axial tension stress and radial shear stress, which can lead to wear out and broken bolts. To solve the problem, better bolts are need for the differential gear housing halves. The bolts are from M 8 to M 10 and all bolts are not directly compatible, so geometric modifications might have to be done. This reports proposes several solutions to this complex problem and also analyzes the proposed solutions. The report also describes various theories from a technical and a historical point of view.

Although the analysis to welded <b>joints</b> and <b>wedge</b> <b>joints</b> have been included in the proposed solution.

In contrast to the incorporation of more conventional physical and chemical foaming agents into bondlines, typically in excess of a 10 % addition level, it was found that the addition of just a few per cent of graphite was sufficient to provide a reliable disbonding mechanism.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} geological risks, {{the study of}} rocky slopes {{plays a key role}} in the Earth Sciences, especially in areas of high vulnerability due to the presence of human settlement. The present paper describes the stability and runout analyses carried out along the Alta Tambura road, in correspondence with the Guadine village connecting the Massa urban settlement to the Apuan Alps (Tuscany, Italy). The integration among various types of survey and analytical methodologies allowed for the application of up-to-date approaches for hazard assessment. Results from these types of studies are useful in the decision-making process concerning choosing the most appropriate mitigation works and, as in such a case, their a posteriori validation. With regard to the survey techniques, terrestrial laser scanning and digital close-range photogrammetry were used to produce the digital elevation model, oriented stereo-images, orthophotos and accurate positions and volumes of rocky <b>wedges</b> and <b>joints</b> located on the slope overhanging the analyzed road. Thanks to this data, a deterministic stability analysis was conducted and the spatial distribution of rock fall density, velocities and kinetic energies was modeled by means of the "cone-method".

The definitive version is available at: [URL] present investigation focuses on novel anodising processes which are being developed for the replacement of the hexavalent chromium containing 40 / 50 V Bengough-Stuart process, with particular emphasis on their resultant performance in structurally bonded systems used in the demanding and harsh environments encountered on operational aircraft. An electrolytic phosphoric acid based deoxidiser (EPAD) has been studied in combination with a standard sulphuric acid anodise. It has been shown that the EPAD provides an open porous structure in order to enhance adhesion to the modified sulphuric acid anodised (SAA) surface. Additionally, a post anodising (PAD) treatment has been used to aid structural adhesion in combination with the SAA processes. 2 As a control, the standard 40 / 50 V Bengough-Stuart chromic acid anodising (CAA) {{has been used as a}} baseline performance indicator in adhesion tests. Single lap shear (SLS) and modified Boeing wedge tests were used to determine adhesion performance. SLS tests were used to determine initial, dry <b>joint</b> strengths whilst <b>wedge</b> test <b>joints</b> immersed in deionised water for up to 100 hours gave a measure of joint durability. Overall, excellent initial joint strengths and durability have been found with both EPAD plus SAA and PAD plus SAA processes suggesting that these environmentally benign treatments may be used as possible drop-in replacements for the currently used hexavalent chromium process. Electron microscopy has been used to investigate the topographical changes introduced to the surface by the various surface pretreatments under investigation to provide an explanation for the observed adhesion test results...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of studies aimed at assessing the quasi-static behavior of both the rock surrounding an emplacement borehole and the lining within an emplacement borehole for a nuclear waste repository in tuff. Two-dimensional thermomechanical analyses of conditions similar to those representative of the horizontal emplacement option were performed using a distinct element code. Three different behavior models (equivalent continuum, <b>wedge,</b> and parallel <b>joint)</b> were used to investigate the state of deformation at 0 and 100 years following waste emplacement. Three different rock strength assumptions were studied corresponding to ``design,`` ``recommended`` and ``limit`` values given in the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigation (NNWSI) Project Site Characterization Plan Conceptual Design Report (MacDougall et al., 1987). The ground reaction curve concept is introduced to study the potential liner loading resulting from thermally induced borehole closure. The report concludes that for the conditions and parameters assumed, liners may not be significantly loaded by borehole closure, because predicted closures will likely be less than tolerances required to install the lining. The report also concludes that gravity loading of linings by blocks which fall from the surrounding rock should not over-stress the lining. 25 refs., 51 figs., 14 tabs...|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain the}} basic {{data for the}} {{mechanical}} properties of Joomeokjang and Nabijang joints, which are most widely used in Hanok, a comparative analysis for the compression test was carried out. The compressive strengths of the Nabijang and Joomeokjang joints were 55 % and 47 %, respectively, {{compared to that of}} the non-jointed control specimen. An F-test and a t-test were carried out to understand the significant differences between the compressive performances of the Nabijang and Joomeokjang joints.

Although the compressive strength of the Nabijang joint was higher than that of the Joomeokjang joint, the Nabijang joint showed a splitting failure, a complete scattering around the <b>wedge</b> of the <b>joint.</b> Splitting was also the main failure type for the Joomeokjang joint and the crushing failure was mixed. It was understood that joints should be processed or constructed with the acknowledgment that longitudinal splitting {{in the vicinity of the}} mortise is the main failure place for both traditional joints.

40|$|AbstractThe classic crustal strength-depth profile {{based on}} rock {{mechanics}} predicts a brittle strength σ 1 −σ 3 =κ(ρ¯gz−Pf) that increases linearly with depth {{as a consequence}} of [1] the intrinsic brittle pressure dependence κ plus [2] an assumption of hydrostatic pore-fluid pressure, Pf = ρwgz. Many deep borehole stress data agree with a critical state of failure of this form. In contrast, fluid pressures greater than hydrostatic ρ¯gz>Pf>ρwgz are normally observed in clastic continental margins and shale-rich mountain belts. Therefore we explore the predicted shapes of strength-depth profiles using data from overpressured regions, especially those dominated by the widespread disequilibrium-compaction mechanism, in which fluid pressures are hydrostatic above the fluid-retention depth zFRD and overpressured below, increasing parallel to the lithostatic gradient ρ¯gz. Both brittle crustal strength and frictional fault strength below the zFRD must be constant with depth because effective stress (ρ¯gz−Pf) is constant, in contrast with the classic linearly increasing profile. Borehole stress and fluid-pressure measurements in several overpressured deforming continental margins agree with this constant-strength prediction, with the same pressure-dependence κ as the overlying hydrostatic strata. The role of zFRD in critical-taper <b>wedge</b> mechanics and <b>jointing</b> is illustrated. The constant-strength approximation is more appropriate for overpressured crust than classic linearly increasing models...|$|R
40|$|Software {{to create}} individualised finite element (FE) {{models of the}} osseoligamentous spine using {{pre-operative}} computed tomography (CT) data-sets for spinal surgery patients has recently been developed. This study presents a geometric sensitivity analysis of this software to assess the effect of intra-observer variability in user-selected anatomical landmarks. User-selected landmarks on the osseous anatomy were defined from CT data-sets for three scoliosis patients and these landmarks were used to reconstruct patient-specific anatomy of the spine and ribcage using parametric descriptions. The intra-observer errors in landmark co-ordinates for these anatomical landmarks were calculated. FE models of the spine and ribcage were created using the reconstructed anatomy for each patient and these models were analysed for a loadcase simulating clinical flexibility assessment. The intra-observer error in the anatomical measurements was low {{in comparison to the}} initial dimensions, {{with the exception of the}} angular measurements for disc <b>wedge</b> and zygapophyseal <b>joint</b> (z-joint) orientation and disc height. This variability suggested that CT resolution may influence such angular measurements, particularly for small anatomical features, such as the z-joints, and may also affect disc height. The results of the FE analysis showed low variation in the model predictions for spinal curvature with the mean intra-observer variability substantially less than the accepted error in clinical measurement. These findings demonstrate that intra-observer variability in landmark point selection has minimal effect on the subsequent FE predictions for a clinical loadcase...|$|R

The participants in the study included three male high school athletes (mean age 13. 3 years). The knee Q angle of each subject was assessed under three experimental conditions, no wedge, medial wedge, and lateral wedge. In addition, the subjects were filmed while running on a treadmill at 26. 8 m/s (6. 0 mph) under each of the experimental conditions. All subjects were tested wearing identical BGPRO running shoes and identical 1 / 4 in. medial or lateral wedges running the length of the shoe. Two high speed Locam cameras, filming at 100 frames/second, were used to film the posterior frontal plane movement of the subjects. Knee Q angle was determined from 35 mm stationary photography. The results of this study indicated that medial and lateral wedge conditions did not significantly effect a change in knee Q angle, running subtalar angle, hip angle to center of gravity, knee angle to center of gravity, the horizontal distance between knee and center of gravity, the horizontal distance between heel and center of gravity, and the distance between consecutive foot strikes between subjects.

Laterally wedged insoles can reduce many of the biomechanical risk factors for disease development in osteoarthritis patients and lean individuals but their efficacy is unknown for at-risk, obese women. The purpose was to determine how an 8 ° laterally wedged insole influenced kinetic and kinematic gait parameters in obese women. Gait analysis was performed on fourteen obese (average 29. 3 years; BMI 37. 2 kg/m 2) and 14 lean control women (average 26. 1 years; BMI 22. 4 kg/m 2) with and without a full-length, <b>wedged</b> insole. Peak <b>joint</b> angles, the external knee adduction moment and its angular impulse were calculated during preferred and standard 1. 24 m/s walking speeds. Statistical significance was assessed using a 2 -way ANOVA (α= 0. 05). The insole significantly reduced the peak external knee adduction moment (mean decrease of 3. 6 ± 3. 9 Nm for obese and 1. 9 ± 1. 8 Nm for controls) and its angular impulse in both groups. The wedged insoles also produced small changes in ankle dorsiflexion (obese: 1. 2 ± 1. 4 ° increase; control: 1. 5 ± 1. 4 ° increase) and eversion range of motion (obese: 1. 3 ± 1. 9 ° decrease; control: 1. 5 ± 1. 2 ° decrease) but did not alter peak angles of superior joints.

40|$|Background - Segmental {{biomechanics}} of the scoliotic spine {{are important}} since the overall spinal deformity {{is comprised of}} the cumulative coronal and axial rotations of individual joints. This study investigates the coronal plane segmental biomechanics for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients in response to physiologically relevant axial compression. Methods - Individual spinal joint compliance in the coronal plane was measured {{for a series of}} 15 idiopathic scoliosis patients using axially loaded magnetic resonance imaging. Each patient was first imaged in the supine position with no axial load, and then again following application of an axial compressive load. Coronal plane disc wedge angles in the unloaded and loaded configurations were measured. Joint moments exerted by the axial compressive load were used to derive estimates of individual joint compliance. Findings - The mean standing major Cobb angle for this patient series was 46 °. Mean intra-observer measurement error for endplate inclination was 1. 6 °. Following loading, initially highly wedged discs demonstrated a smaller change in wedge angle, than less wedged discs for certain spinal levels (+ 2,+ 1,− 2 relative to the apex, (p < 0. 05)). Highly wedged discs were observed near the apex of the curve, which corresponded to lower joint compliance in the apical region. Interpretation - While individual patients exhibit substantial variability in disc <b>wedge</b> angles and <b>joint</b> compliance, overall there is a pattern of increased disc wedging near the curve apex, and reduced joint compliance in this region. Approaches such as this can provide valuable biomechanical data on in vivo spinal biomechanics of the scoliotic spine, for analysis of deformity progression and surgical planning...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{settings}} and lithological characteristics are traditionally assumed {{to influence the}} development of erosional landforms, such as gully networks and rock couloirs, in steep mountain rock basins. The structural control of erosion of two small alpine catchments of distinctive rock types is evaluated by comparing the correspondences between the orientations of their gullies and rock couloirs with (1) the sliding orientations of potential slope failures mechanisms, and (2) {{the orientation of the}} maximum joint frequency, this latter being considered as the direction exploited primarily by erosion and mass wasting processes. These characteristic orientations can be interpreted as structural weaknesses contributing to the initiation and propagation of erosion. The morphostructural analysis was performed using digital elevation models and field observations. The catchment comprised of magmatic intrusive rocks shows a clear structural control, mostly expressed through potential <b>wedges</b> failure. Such <b>joint</b> configurations have a particular geometry that encourages the development of gullies in hard rock, e. g. through enhanced gravitational and hydrological erosional processes. In the catchment underlain by sedimentary rocks, penetrative joints that act as structural weaknesses seem to be exploited by gullies and rock couloirs. However, the lithological setting and bedding configuration prominently control the development of erosional landforms, and influence not only the local pattern of geomorphic features, but the general morphology of the catchment. The orientations of the maximum joint frequency are clearly associated with the gully network, suggesting that its development is governed by anisotropy in rock strength. These two catchments are typical of bedrock-dominated basins prone to intense processes of debris supply. This study suggests a quantitative approach for describing the relationship between bedrock jointing and geomorphic features geometry. Incorporation of bedrock structure can be relevant when studying processes governing the transfer of clastic material, for the assessment of sediment yields and in landforms evolution models...|$|R
3000|$|Foot {{and ankle}} {{deformities}} {{have been the}} most challenging and disabling problems with FH. FH foot deformity has many components. At the ankle there is a dysplasia of the distal tibia and of the talus, which ranges from mild valgus of the distal tibia to severe dysplasia with flat malformed, maloriented joint surfaces. The distal tibial physis is more affected then the proximal tibial physis, with the former being often <b>wedge</b> shaped. The <b>joint</b> surface of the distal tibia ranges from a normal plafond with a 90 ° lateral distal tibial angle (LDTA) and 80 ° anterior distal tibial angle (ADTA) to a valgus plafond with an LDTA of < 90 ° and an ADTA of > 80 ° (procurvatum). The distal tibial articular surface is often concave in the frontal plane as part of a ball and socket ankle joint. The talus too ranges in its articular shape from normal to ball shaped in the frontal plane and from round to nearly flat in the sagittal plane. The talar neck may be very short and have little concave offset. The ankle joint function with FH may range from: normal range of motion, stable, no valgus instability, and no deformity; to, limited arc of motion, unstable with valgus instability, and fixed equino-valgus or varus deformity. Part of this deformity and instability is related to the fibular deficiency and part to the subtalar pathology. The fibula normally contributes to the lateral stability of the ankle. If the fibula is absent or deficient, then the ankle will sublux or roll into valgus. The subtalar joint pathology ranges from a normal subtalar joint to a subtalar joint with subtalar coalition. This subtalar coalition usually involves the posterior facet and is often malunited into equino-valgus. In a small minority of cases the subtalar coalition is malunited into equino-varus (clubfoot type). The combination of a malunited coalition, with valgus ankle joint instability, with a maloriented distal tibia produces a very significant magnitude of equino-valgus deformity of the foot and ankle. This foot malorientation is also associated with contractures of the tendo-Achilles and peroneal tendons. A further tether into equino-valgus may come from the fibular remnant referred to as the anlage. This anlage may be fibrous or both fibrous and cartilaginous. In some cases there is coalition of the cartilaginous fibular anlage to the calcaneus. Much of this patho-anatomy can be well visualized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).|$|R
