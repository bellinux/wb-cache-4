5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial <b>waste,</b> <b>air,</b> noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

Despite this, environmental regulations to which large companies must comply with are often not applicable to SMEs. This study examines <b>wastes</b> and <b>air</b> emissions generated by SMEs in the Western Australian manufacturing sector. The study consisted of (1) face-to-face surveys of 42 SMEs in Perth, Western Australia; (2) detailed waste and energy audits for a sub-group of the above; and (3) exploring innovative sustainability approaches for SMEs to reduce <b>wastes</b> and <b>air</b> emissions. A relatively small number of initiatives to reduce wastes and emissions undertaken by the SMEs were found such as investing in improved technologies or equipment, and utilising waste streams as inputs for other business operations. A decrease in the uptake of sustainability initiatives was evident compared to previous studies in the region. The paper presents an overview of the findings of the study, as well as the barriers to the uptake of sustainability initiatives among the SMEs for reducing their <b>wastes</b> and <b>air</b> emissions...|$|R

Waste activated sludge and primary sludge are combined, where appropriate, and passed to a thickener where the solids content is increased. This substantially reduces the volume that is required to be treated in the digester.The process is usually run as a batch process {{with more than one}} digester tank in operation at any one time.Air is pumped through the tank and the contents are stirred to keep the contents fully mixed. Carbon dioxide, <b>waste</b> <b>air</b> and small quantities of other gases including hydrogen sulfide are given off. These waste gases require treatment to reduce odours in works close to housing or capable of generating public nuisance. The digestion is continued until the percentage of degradable solids is reduced to between 20% and 10% depending on local conditions Where non sewage waste is being processed, organic waste such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste and be significantly reduced in volume leaving an output that can be used as soil improver or biomass fuel.|$|E
