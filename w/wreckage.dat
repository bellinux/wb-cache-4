5|$|In 1986, the <b>wreckage</b> of an Avenger {{was found}} off the Florida coast during {{the search for}} the <b>wreckage</b> of the Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation {{archaeologist}} Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of the}} missing planes.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} <b>wreckage</b> from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the {{original}} <b>wreckage</b> had been found. This <b>wreckage</b> was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December 1961, {{an empty}} {{coaching}} stock train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with a freight train at Conington, Huntingdonshire. Locomotive No. 60078 Night Hawk was hauling a freight train that ran into the <b>wreckage.</b> A third freight train then ran into the <b>wreckage.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1998, the TSB {{initiated}} a heavy lift operation {{to retrieve the}} major portion of the <b>wreckage</b> from the deep water before the expected winter storms began. By 21 October, an estimated 27% of the <b>wreckage</b> was recovered.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the <b>wreckage</b> within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the <b>wreckage</b> would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected <b>wreckage</b> emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|Stock {{footage of}} the plane <b>wreckage</b> was {{utilized}} in the 2004 film, The Day After Tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the <b>wreckage.</b> Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged <b>wreckage</b> to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|An Su-25K of the Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo {{disappeared}} in December 2006 during a routine rebasing operation and no <b>wreckage</b> was ever found.|$|E
5|$|Joanna is then {{ordered to}} snoop around and {{investigate}} the crash site. In the process, she is captured {{and taken to}} the Pelagic I ship, along with the alien <b>wreckage.</b> Nevertheless, a mysterious alien rescues her and convinces her to sink the Pelagic I with the <b>wreckage</b> and escape. She succeeds and when she contacts Carrington, she tells him that she discovered that the <b>wreckage</b> belonged to an alien race called the Skedar. The situation changes abruptly when the Carrington Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team who hopes to destroy any clues of the conspiracy. Joanna manages to defend the Institute and her work earned her enough recognition {{to take part in}} her next mission. The game ends with the Carrington Institute carrying out further investigations of dataDyne, setting the stage for the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and {{climbed out of the}} <b>wreckage.</b> After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off {{in the direction of a}} nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the <b>wreckage.</b> Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the <b>wreckage,</b> including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{charged with}} {{investigating}} the accident, examined the <b>wreckage</b> at Long Island MacArthur Airport. Reports from witnesses {{of the crash}} indicated the aircraft appeared {{to have made a}} normal takeoff and began climbing normally. But, moments later it began banking sharply to the right. Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found in the <b>wreckage</b> that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.|$|E
5|$|A wooden motor barge, the Halfren of 1913, {{was also}} used in the {{demolition}} work, for collecting small pieces of <b>wreckage.</b> Worn out by this work and the frequent groundings, it was abandoned on the shore at Aust.|$|E
5|$|Air India Express Flight 812 was a {{scheduled}} passenger service from Dubai to Mangalore, which, at around 06:30 IST on 22 May 2010, overshot the runway on landing, fell over a cliff, and caught fire, spreading <b>wreckage</b> across the surrounding hillside. Of the 160 passengers and six crew members on board, only eight passengers survived.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{cross-country}} flight to Wright Field in Ohio from Platt-LePage's Pennsylvania plant, {{testing of the}} XR-1A continued until a mechanical failure in the rotor hub led to a crash landing on 26 October 1944, the company deciding to sell the <b>wreckage</b> for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Following the crash, the aircraft's cockpit voice {{recorder}} was recovered from the <b>wreckage</b> and the data recorded found to be intact and usable. Under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 Air Taxi rules, no flight data recorder was required {{for this type of}} flight and one had not been installed.|$|E
5|$|In 2018, John Connor (Bale) leads {{an attack}} on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and {{schematics}} for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue, the T-800. John survives a violent assault on the base, which is destroyed. Following John's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's <b>wreckage</b> and begins walking towards Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft <b>wreckage</b> in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|In Survivor's Quest, Zahn's 2004 {{sequel to}} Vision of the Future, Luke and Mara journey to {{investigate}} the <b>wreckage</b> of Outbound Flight, a Jedi expedition destroyed by Thrawn years before. Newly discovered by the Chiss, the remains {{turn out to be}} the lure in a trap laid by the bloodthirsty Vagaari to avenge themselves on the Chiss.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating <b>wreckage</b> caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Richards {{found one}} dog alive in its cage and {{released}} it. Webb found another suffering from burns and hiding behind a farmyard. An RSPCA inspector later arrived {{and took the}} injured dog to a vet in Abingdon. One badly injured dog was put down. Six dogs were found dead in the <b>wreckage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has the <b>wreckage</b> of two {{complete}} {{aircraft that}} were recovered from separate crash sites near Murmansk in 1990 and 1994. These wrecks were purchased from New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally {{planned for the}} remains to be restored to airworthy, in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The Flight Data Recorder was recovered intact from the <b>wreckage,</b> but the Cockpit Voice Recorder had been damaged in the post-crash fire and was unusable.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The <b>wreckage</b> had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen {{to believe that a}} specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette <b>wreckage,</b> thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wreckage</b> of the {{aircraft}} was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 and was taken to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine guns in the nose but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane still exist, including the two engines {{and a piece of}} the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six deaths in {{incidents}} related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds. A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident. Another four {{people were killed in}} an automobile accident in southern Jalisco. Two of the victims died in the <b>wreckage</b> and the other two died after being brought to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed <b>wreckage</b> of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the <b>wreckage</b> that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 <b>wreckage</b> in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found <b>wreckage</b> and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{subsequent}} {{search for}} the Japanese carriers was unsuccessful. In September 1999, a joint expedition between Nauticos Corp. and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office searched for the Japanese aircraft carriers. Using advanced renavigation techniques {{in conjunction with the}} ship's log of the submarine USS Nautilus, the expedition located a large piece of <b>wreckage,</b> subsequently identified as having come from the upper hangar deck of Kaga. The main wreck of Kaga has yet to be located.|$|E
5|$|Glasnost {{reforms in}} the same year brought about a {{relaxation}} of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location of the <b>wreckage</b> and had possession of the flight data recorders. On December 10, 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the <b>wreckage</b> was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.|$|E
5|$|In {{its earlier}} years, the studio did not {{hesitate}} to take advantage of scandal sheet–worthy events. After the death of celebrated Paramount actor Wallace Reid, brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, Dorothy Davenport, signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: Human <b>Wreckage,</b> released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused {{the hull of}} the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the <b>wreckage</b> of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. No one on the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July, Linienschiffsleutnant Ludwig Müller sailed U-20 {{out from}} Trieste for the Gulf of Venice. A day later, U-20 was spotted by the Italian {{submarine}} F-12, {{which was on}} patrol in the northern Adriatic. F-12 initially pursued U-20 underwater, {{and then on the}} surface. At a range of , F-12 torpedoed U-20 at position , sinking her with all hands. There was no <b>wreckage</b> on the surface, only an oil slick. Like all of her sister boats, U-20 had no wartime successes.|$|E
5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the <b>wreckage.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1952, {{locomotive}} No. 46242 City of Glasgow was hauling {{an express}} passenger train when it overran signals {{and crashed into}} a local passenger train at , Middlesex. Another express passenger train ran into the <b>wreckage.</b> In the second deadliest railway accident in the United Kingdom, 102 people were killed at the scene and 10 more died later from their injuries; no fewer than 340 people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the <b>wreckage</b> of the crashed helicopter.|$|E
