5|$|Ripley's early {{television}} and film career was characterised by minor roles as prostitutes or mistresses; {{in what was}} to be her film debut, she filmed two scenes as a prostitute in the film Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh, 1994). In the first scene, her character was strangled by the creature (played by Robert De Niro's stand-in). The second scene featured De Niro himself, though Ripley's character was lying dead in a mortuary throughout. Pleased <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like her breakout role, Ripley bought a dress for the premiere, though she was distraught when Branagh sent her a card apologising for cutting her scenes from the finished film. The same year, she filmed the role of Karen Hughes, the sister of a mute character who believes she sees a murder, in the low-budget film Mute Witness (Anthony Waller, 1995). After Mute Witnesss British television premiere in 1999, a Daily Record critic wrote that Ripley's dramatic scenes were not as good as her comic ones.|$|E
25|$|After day two Team USA led <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like an {{unassailable}} 12-6 lead. Europe {{took the}} final days first session 5-0 {{to get back into}} contention at 11-12, before leading 14-13 going into the final evening session.|$|E
25|$|Security was {{frequently}} a problem, {{particularly in the}} club's latter years. There were several shootings {{inside and outside the}} club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.|$|E
5000|$|Mike and Ran, {{a pair of}} cats <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like {{bandages}} {{between their}} legs, a comical way of suggesting they've been neutered.Mike's weapon set is heavily based on first Darius, while Ran takes her weapons from the R-Type Leo.|$|R
50|$|Will, Lyra, Tialys, and Salmakia {{reach the}} world of the dead from a world <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like a Dutch or Danish farmstead, where the villagers have just been massacred by armed {{soldiers}} and their village razed (this conflict is never explained).|$|R
6000|$|... "Beyond the Jewish ruler, banded close, [...] A company full glorious, I saw [...] The twelve apostles stand. O, <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> [...] Of ravishment and joy, what rapturous tears; [...] What {{hearts of}} ecstacy, they gazed again [...] On their beloved Master"---- ...|$|R
500|$|The {{main part}} of the body was {{typically}} about [...] wide and had 15 segments, on each of which there were pairs of lobes (flaps) pointing downwards and outwards. The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it. The body ended <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out, forming a tail like a V-shaped double fan.|$|E
500|$|Art {{directors}} Nilo Rodis and Dave Carson {{designed the}} Klingon Bird of Prey, while George constructed the model. Nimoy wanted {{the ship to}} be reminiscent of an attacking bird, with movable wings that changed {{depending on whether the}} ship was in a cruising or attack posture. George took design cues from sketches of bodybuilders and football players, incorporating the starship equivalents of down-stretched, threatening arms and muscular shoulders, together <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like shoulder pads and a chin guard on the ship's outstretched neck. Although the stolen Romulan ship thread was cut from the film, the Bird of Prey design had incorporated elements of Romulan design. [...] "It has some of the basic bird shape, but it's more ominous", Ralston said. A graphic bird design was integrated into the ship's underside.|$|E
500|$|Mark Bingham {{called his}} mother at 09:37:03 from row25. He {{reported}} that the plane had been hijacked by three men {{who claimed to have}} a bomb. Jeremy Glick called his wife at 09:37:41 from row27 and told her the flight was hijacked by three dark-skinned men who looked [...] "Iranian", wearing [...] and wielding knives. Glick remained connected {{until the end of the}} flight. He {{reported that the}} passengers voted whether to [...] "rush" [...] the hijackers. The United air traffic control coordinator for West Coast flights, Alessandro [...] "Sandy" [...] Rogers, alerted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Herndon Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, that Flight93 was not responding and was off course. A minute later, the transponder was turned off, but the Cleveland controller continued to monitor the flight on primary radar. The Herndon Center relayed information on Flight93 to FAA headquarters. Joseph DeLuca called his father at 09:43:03 from row26 to inform him the flight had been hijacked. Todd Beamer attempted to call his wife from row32 at 09:43:48, but was routed to GTE phone operator Lisa D. Jefferson. Beamer told the operator that the flight was hijacked and that two people who he thought were the pilots were on the floor dead or dying. He said one of the hijackers had a red belt <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> to be a bomb strapped to his waist. When the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, Beamer briefly panicked, exclaiming, [...] "We're going down! We're going down!" [...] Meanwhile, Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit, refusing to allow a hijacker to engage the autopilot and thereby set its coordinates for their target, Washington, D.C. The hijackers were heard to say [...] "Inform them, and tell him to talk to the pilot; bring the pilot back", possibly referring to Homer (CVR transcripts). A United employee in San Francisco, California, sent an ACARS message to the flight at 09:46, [...] "Heard report of incident. Plz confirm all is normal." [...] Linda Gronlund called her sister, Elsa Strong, at 09:46:05 and left her a message saying there were [...] "men with a bomb." ...|$|E
5|$|Measure 1–30: the {{orchestra}} presents itself <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like a ritornello, but {{is in fact}} rather a concerto tutti.

40|$|The use {{of games}} {{technology}} in {{education is not}} a new phenomenon.

40|$|The commandry at the Masonic Temple has {{gathered}} for a photograph {{in one of their}} buildings rooms. There is an ornate wall behind the group <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like thrones directly behind them. The men are all dressed in commandry uniforms with plumed hats and swords.

2500|$|The CBS Television series Route 66 (1960–1964), {{featuring}} two untethered {{young men}} [...] "on the road" [...] in a Corvette seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary {{jobs in the}} various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, {{gave the impression of}} being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for On the Road. Even the leads, Buz and Todd, bore a resemblance to the dark, athletic Kerouac [...] and the blonde Cassady/Moriarty, respectively. Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by Route 66 creator Stirling Silliphant and sought to sue him, CBS, the Screen Gems TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a very potent cause of action.|$|E
60|$|Then suddenly, {{a bright}} idea broke on my brain at once. The Index! The Index! Presumably, as no fold seemed {{to obscure the}} first words, the name began <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a B. That was always something.|$|E
60|$|Kate was violently {{opposed to}} {{anything}} of this kind, and, at last, told Aunt Matilda {{that if she}} persisted in surrounding her house <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a forest of tombstones, she, Kate, would have to stop coming there.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of small gold ingots (referred to by modern numismatists as Piloncitos), presumed {{to have been}} used as currency and [...] "stamped <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like the pre-Spanish Baybayin character [...] ", have led some historians such as Ambeth Ocampo theorize that the writing may be a reference to Ma-i, although numerous other interpretations have also been suggested.|$|R
5000|$|The qilin (...) or kirin is {{a mythical}} hooved chimerical {{creature}} known in Chinese and other East Asian cultures, said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a sage or illustrious ruler. It {{is a good}} omen thought to occasion prosperity or serenity. It is often depicted <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like fire all over its body.|$|R
40|$|The basket or bridal veil conceals {{her face}} until {{she is in}} her husbands house. " A covered sedan sits outside a doorway. A young woman, presumably the bride, {{stands in front of}} the sedan door <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> to be a basket over her head. To her right stands a man, and on the stairs to her left are two other men...|$|R
60|$|The man did so {{and went}} off with the barrow. Maumbry {{paused for a moment}} to wipe his face, and resumed his homely {{drudgery}} amid this squalid and reeking scene, pressing down and stirring the contents of the copper <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like an old rolling-pin. The steam therefrom, laden with death, travelled in a low trail across the meadow.|$|E
60|$|The {{audience}} of partners {{were listening to}} it intently, the more because it seemed to them that Bob {{had made a mistake}} as to the tune, and they were anxious to see {{what he was going to}} do about it--when the pony Toby had been riding suddenly dashed into the ring, <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> very like a boy on his back.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice's manner puzzled him. As a rule, she was friendly, yet {{he could}} not flatter himself that he was making much progress, and {{sometimes}} she was distinctly aloof. He might have placed a favorable interpretation upon her reserve, but unfortunately it was tinged <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> very much like hostility. Harding imagined that she was influenced by her father; and he was troubled.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{miscegenation}} scene (in which Julie's {{husband is}} supposed to suck blood from her hand {{so that he can}} truthfully claim that he has [...] "Negro" [...] blood in him), he is seen pricking her finger <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like a sewing pin, rather than using an ominous-looking switchblade, as in the play and the 1936 film, to cut her hand with.|$|R
50|$|Up until now, {{scientists}} {{assumed that}} the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates was a shark-like animal, with no distinct jawbones, and that modern jaws evolved in early bony fishes. This discovery shows that modern jaws evolved earlier. It is possible that Chondrichthyes started with distinct jaws and then dispensed with them. This {{has been called the}} earliest known animal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like a face.|$|R
5|$|Piper Maru, a French salvage vessel, is {{exploring}} the Pacific Ocean. Gauthier, {{a member of}} the ship's crew, dives down into the sea and finds a sunken fighter plane from World War II.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is what they call dying, sister. It is a much lovelier way to end than as we do in the dust bin or rag-bag. I wonder if there is a little Heaven {{anywhere}} for good dolls?" [...] answered Flora, <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a tear on her cheek; but it was only a drop from the violets sent by the kind Doctor last night.|$|E
60|$|As {{they passed}} indoors, the little cleric hopped {{suddenly}} {{on to the}} table, and standing on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak. Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed; while Fanshaw was so amused <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a performing pigmy on his little stand, {{that he could not}} control his laughter. But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'While your Mr. Leggatt was effectin' repairs, another {{searchlight}} {{broke out}} to the southward, {{and the two of}} 'em swept our ridge on both sides. Right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a hill, so to speak, crowned <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a little fort. Morshed saw it before the beams shut off.

50|$|Cassie and Tobias {{are having}} strange dreams about a {{presence}} in the ocean. Jake sees a news item on television about debris <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like Andalite lettering on it that has washed up on the beach, and when he shows it to the others, Cassie and Tobias have such strong visions that they momentarily pass out. The Animorphs decide to investigate, and acquire dolphin morphs to do so.|$|R

50|$|The view is next {{of a road}} {{outside a}} saloon and shadows in the window {{indicate}} that the patrons are having a good time. A small gun chase takes place and a passer-by is whacked on the head <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like a bottle of beer. Next, a really tall cowboy walks down the road but has {{the middle of his}} body shot out by the patrons. This results in him being reduced {{to the size of a}} midget.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry did so, {{holding it}} close to the top box, of which the lid, {{rendered}} rotten by time even in that dry place, {{appeared to have been}} smashed in, probably by Da Silvestra himself. Pushing my hand {{through the hole in the}} lid I drew it out full, not of diamonds, but of gold pieces, of a shape that none of us had seen before, and <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like Hebrew characters stamped upon them.|$|E
60|$|Again he {{left the}} cave, {{returning}} ten minutes later <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like a slender bamboo, save {{that there were no}} joints in it. Through the middle of the pole, running the entire length, was a small hole hardly larger than {{is to be found in}} a reed, and with this while standing five or six feet from the stream he drank at leisure, keeping his eyes fixed upon the surface of the water to guard against an attack.|$|E
60|$|The {{place was}} glorious beyond compare, but very {{strange to me}} {{and not to be}} described. I sat me down upon a boulder which burned like a ruby, whether with heat or colour I do not know, by the edge of a stream that flowed <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> like fire and made a lovely music. I stooped down and drank of this water of flames and the scent and the taste of it were as those of the costliest wine.|$|E
5000|$|Over his career, Hodges {{has worked}} in painting, drawing, {{printing}} and sculpture. Much of his work, across mediums, has been interested in organic geometry: [...] "I {{have done a lot}} of works that use geometry but at the same time I {{have done a lot of}} works <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like repeated forms when, in fact, every curve is different. So I guess, a kind of organic geometry is actually what I am aiming at, sort of like nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|How can we {{assert that}} magic stones, or any such stone objects, {{perforated}} or not, were necessarily incongruous with [...] "the earlier Scottish civilisation?" [...] No civilisation, old or new, {{is incapable of}} possessing such stones; even Scotland, as I shall show, can boast two or three samples, such as the stone of the Keiss broch, a perfect circle, engraved <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> like an attempt at a Runic inscription; and another {{in a kind of}} cursive characters.|$|R
