500|$|In 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers' Association stated, [...] "We {{still do}} not believe CCD (which is now better defined) is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> to {{experience}} colony losses, many if not most {{of which can be}} explained."

500|$|In the United Kingdom, a {{national}} bee database {{was set up}} in March 2009 to monitor colony collapse {{as a result of a}} 15% reduction in the bee population that had taken place over the previous two years. In particular, the register, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and administered by the National Bee Unit, will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate. In October 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers’ Association stated, [...] "We still do not believe CCD is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained. The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors that reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions." ...|$|E

[...] "The President should know that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> the effort to discredit VVAW," [...] Colson assured Halderman. Nixon aides formed the Vietnam Veterans for a Just Peace, according to Colson, as a [...] "counterfoil" [...] to Kerry and the VVAW, and they did everything they could to boost the group. [...] John O'Neill, representing this group, made public appearances denouncing the antiwar veterans and promoting Nixon's Vietnamization policy. [...] According to White House memos, Colson worked behind the scenes to get a Kerry-O'Neill debate on nationwide television. [...] "Let's destroy this young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader," [...] he wrote, referring to Kerry.|$|E
5000|$|Brave is {{the first}} Pixar film {{starring}} a female protagonist. Merida was originally to be voiced by Reese Witherspoon, who declined due to scheduling issues.

[...] Instead, the character was voiced by Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald.

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Keating, and {{renaming}} COP Keating after him, a “Night Letter” appeared {{on the door of}} the Upper Kamdesh mosque on April 29 of 2007. Part of the letter stated: [...] “At the present time for those who work and obey the American devils by taking contracts for building schools, road, and power plants: also those who work as police, district administrators, and commanders as well as sold-out mullahs who deny Allah’s orders and holy war and deny the holy Quran: [...] We are telling you that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> our holy war in Allah’s will…Soon we will start our operations.” This letter was written in Pashto and signed “Mujahideen”. The following day insurgents kidnapped and murdered Fazal Ahad, an elder from the village of Badmuk who was attempting to end the Kom/Kata tribal disagreements by arranging a meeting in Kamdesh. In response to this, the local Afghan officials sent more government troops into the area to increase security. These troops were ambushed on the Naray/Kamdesh road and shot up badly enough to prevent their arrival in Kamdesh.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's {{inspector-general}} Aqil al-Turehi, he had {{investigated the}} device in 2008 but found it [...] "inoperative" [...] and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: [...] "There was corruption {{associated with this}} contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally {{in the field of}} explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device." [...] Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been [...] "marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions." [...] The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns. An unnamed Iraqi officer told the Agence France-Presse that [...] "We know it doesn't work and that it has been banned , but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> to use it. It is bullshit.

6000|$|Here is {{the real}} difficulty. Cyclic poets of the eighth and seventh centuries had {{certainly}} lost touch with the Epic tradition; their poems make that an admitted fact. Yet poets of the eighth to seventh centuries were, by the theory, busily adding to and altering the ancient lays of the Iliad. How did they abstain from the new or revived ideas, and from the new genre of romance? Are we to believe that one set of late Ionian poets--they who added to and altered the Iliad--were true to tradition, while another contemporary set of Ionian poets, the Cyclics--authors of new Epics on Homeric themes--are known to have quite lost touch with the Homeric taste, religion, and ritual? The reply will perhaps be a Cyclic poet said, [...] "Here I am going to compose quite a new poem about the old heroes. I shall make them do and think and believe as I please, {{without reference to the}} evidence of the old poems." [...] But, {{it will have to be}} added, the rhapsodists of 800-540 B.C., and the general editor of the latter date, thought, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>continuing</b> an old set of lays, and we must be very careful in adhering to manners, customs, and beliefs as described by our predecessors. For instance, the old heroes had only bronze, no iron,--and then the rhapsodists forgot, and made iron a common commodity in the Iliad. Again, the rhapsodists knew that the ancient heroes had no corslets--the old lays, we learn, never spoke of corslets--but they made them wear corslets of much splendour. [Footnote: The reader must remember that the view of the late poets as careful adherents of tradition in usages and ideas only obtains sometimes; at others the critics declare that archaeological precision is not preserved, and that the Ionic continuators introduced, for example, the military gear of their own period into a poem which represents much older weapons and equipments.] This theory does not help us. In an uncritical age poets could not discern that their genre of romance and religion was alien from that of Homer.|$|E
