5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tampa Bay {{to the lowest level}} ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|Many early {{suggestions}} {{focused on}} adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following {{the hypothesis that}} hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s.

Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs, and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port {{to be handed over}} to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{brought a}} storm surge of 10–12 ft (3–3.5 m) to Tampa Bay. The highest rainfall total in Tampa was at 8.53 in (23.5 mm). However, the observer noted that winds probably blew <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gauge. The barometric pressure fell to , breaking a previous record set in 1910. The hurricane also brought sustained winds of 75 mph (119 km/h) and a storm tide of 10.5 ft (3 m). Damage {{from the wind}} was generally minor, {{while most of the}} impact wrought by the storm was due to abnormally high tides in Tampa and elsewhere in the area. Much of the city was flooded, with the worst along Bayshore Boulevard, where some of the most expensive properties were located. At Hyde Park, dwellings were inundated about halfway up the first story, prompting several people to be rescued by boat. Electrical poles and wires were washed away near the intersection of Bayshore Boulevard and Howard Avenue. The latter was also left impassible by car. In the Palmetto Beach neighborhood, much of the section was inundated. A group of about 40 volunteers rescued a number of women and children. A total of 50 homes were destroyed by cedar logs used to construct cigar boxes at the Tampa Box Company on 22nd Street.|$|E
