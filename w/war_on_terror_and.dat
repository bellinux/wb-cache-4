5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{produced}} by longtime Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich in Los Angeles. To avoid the protracted recording sessions of previous albums, Radiohead recorded Hail to the Thief quickly and focused on recording live takes rather than overdubs. Songwriter Thom Yorke wrote many of the lyrics {{in response to the}} <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> the resurgence of right-wing politics in the west {{at the turn of the}} millennium.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), mixed {{rock and}} {{electronic}} music with lyrics {{inspired by the}} <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> <b>and</b> was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E

40|$|In this Article I seek {{to begin}} a more {{sustained}} comparison between the <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> <b>and</b> crime. While I share much of the criticism of how we have waged the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror,</b> I suspect it is both too simple and ultimately too comforting to assert that the Bush administration alone remade our justice system and betrayed our values … Many critics of the Bush administration 2 ̆ 7 s terror policies open with some version of the question-how did it come to this? My Article seeks to address the same question. Specifically, I will explore five areas in which our domestic criminal system has informed our approach to the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror: (1) the scope of our prison complex, (2) prison conditions and prisoner abuse, (3) our harsh treatment of juveniles, (4) attacks on judicial authority, and (5) undermining the role of defense counsel. In addition, I will discuss the innocence movement, which I argue has somewhat tempered the prosecution of both the <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> crime <b>and</b> <b>terror...</b>|$|R
