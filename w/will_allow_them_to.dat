5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set inside an ancient Egyptian tomb. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to escape the tomb, the Great Sphinx, before all oxygen runs out. To achieve this end, the player must navigate a series of chambers linked by corridors, solve logic puzzles and deal with hostile enemies by either avoiding or fighting them. The tomb has seven floors. Pendragon's only form of defence is his whip, which he can utilise to defend himself from enemies. The player also has access to a torch, which <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see in certain pitch-black areas of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Once the Earl Marshal has {{approved}} the petition he will issue his Warrant to the King of Arms, this <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{proceed with the}} granting of the arms. It is during this stage that the designing and formation of the arms begin. Although the King of Arms has full discretion over {{the composition of the}} arms, he will take into full account the wishes of the applicant. These will include allusions and references to the applicant's life and achievements. The design of any new coat of arms must abide by all the rules of heraldry as well as being entirely original and distinct from all previous arms recorded at the College's archives. A preliminary sketch will then be approved and sent to the petitioner for approval.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E

5|$|The party {{returns to}} Alexandria to install Garnet as queen, but are {{assaulted}} at her coronation by Kuja. Garnet and Eiko summon an eidolon to combat Kuja's; when Kuja {{tries to take}} control of their eidolon, he is stopped by an old man named Garland, who then uses Kuja's ship to destroy Garnet's eidolon and damage the city. Kuja flees with the intent to fight Garland for power. Seeking to stop both of them, the party gets an experimental airship from Cid that runs on steam rather than Mist, which <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> journey to the other continents. Chasing Kuja, they find a portal to the parallel world of Terra; there they discover that Terra is dying, and its people created Garland to orchestrate merging the two worlds. Garland in turn created Genomes, self-aware soulless beings which would be taken over by Terran souls after the merging. The Iifa Tree serves to block Gaian souls from leaving Gaia but letting Terran souls in to be reborn into the Genomes, with the Gaian souls transformed into the Mist. Kuja and Zidane are Genomes, and Kuja turned against Garland to avoid being taken over {{at the conclusion of the}} plan. Kuja kills Garland with his newly gained powers, then destroys Terra as the party flees to Gaia with the Genomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how that <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E

25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is a consequence}} of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means that at any given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time to sequester resources that <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> interchange as the game progresses. The aim {{of this is to}} confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be in a totally different position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E

He later befriends another slave named Einar who teaches him how to farm. Thorfinn and Einar are to work {{together}} as slaves and as farmers. Their farm, given to them by Ketil, <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> purchase their freedom through the success with their crops. Einar and Thorfinn also befriend Ketil's father and Snake, the head guard of the farms. This friendship leads to mutual assistance which grants Einar and Thorfinn tools that were necessary to clear, till, and plant on the plot of land given to them by Ketil. Einar is in love with a fellow slave, Arneis, who returns his affections. However, she is Ketil's mistress.|$|E
25|$|In each level, {{the player}} is {{accompanied}} by three computer-controlled wingmen: Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. At certain pre-scripted points, one will fly into the player's view, often either chasing an enemy or being chased and asking for assistance. Ignoring a wingman's pleas will result in him taking damage, or even being shot down. They cannot be damaged by the player's own lasers (although they will complain if hit). Regardless of their survival, wingmen are not present during boss battles but rejoin the player before the next stage. A player may choose to help their wingmen when they ask for assistance, as doing so <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> engage some of the enemies not destroyed by the player, helping the player to succeed and additionally {{making it easier to}} achieve maximum score in a given level. Additional points are also granted {{at the end of each}} level depending on the health of each wingman. If a wingman gets shot down, he will not return for the rest of the game.|$|E

50|$|Sims are {{influenced}} by the player to interact with objects or other Sims. Sims may receive guests, invited or not, from other playable lots or from unhoused NPC Sims. If enabled in the game's options, Sims have a certain amount of free <b>will,</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> autonomously interact with their world. However, the player can override most autonomous actions by cancelling them out in the action queue {{at the top of the}} screen. Unlike the simulated environments in games such as SimCity, SimEarth or SimLife, Sims are not fully autonomous. They are unable to take certain actions without specific commands, such as paying bills, finding a job, exercising and conceiving children.

They learn that the Resistance may be able to close the portal using a copy of a Combine transmission Alyx is carrying. At an abandoned mine, Alyx is critically wounded by a Combine Hunter. A vortigaunt leads them to an underground Resistance shelter. Gordon recovers larval extract from a nearby antlion colony, necessary for the vortigaunts to heal Alyx. While the vortigaunts heal her, the mysterious G-Man contacts Gordon and hints at Alyx's importance to his own plans, revealing that he saved her life at the Black Mesa Research Facility despite objections from an unspecified third party.

500|$|Weeks {{after the}} attack, {{the death toll}} was {{estimated}} to be over 6,000, more than twice the number of deaths eventually confirmed. The city was only able to identify remains for about 1,600 of the World Trade Center victims. The medical examiner's office collected [...] "about 10,000 unidentified bone and tissue fragments that cannot be matched to the list of the dead". Bone fragments were still being found in 2006 by workers who were preparing to demolish the damaged Deutsche Bank Building. In 2010, a team of anthropologists and archaeologists searched for human remains and personal items at the Fresh Kills Landfill, where seventy-two more human remains were recovered, bringing the total found to 1,845. DNA profiling continues in an attempt to identify additional victims. The remains are being held in storage in Memorial Park, outside the New York City Medical Examiner's facilities. It was expected that the remains would be moved in 2013 to a repository behind a wall at the 9/11 museum. In July 2011, a team of scientists at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner was still trying to identify remains, in the hope that improved technology <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify other victims.

500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment that <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E

By simulating a few different cases with different symmetric and asymmetric non-uniform patterns of opinion changing probabilities, we demonstrate the significant effects that the different loyalty levels of different opinions have on the final state of the opinion distribution.
