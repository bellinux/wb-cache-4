The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.|$|E

After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

The Legacy sponsors campaign training schools, links candidates with volunteers and experts, collaborates with like-minded organizations and provides campaign grants to endorsed candidates.

25|$|The conquests {{destroyed}} little: <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> suppress were imperial rivalries and sectarian bloodletting {{among the}} newly subjected population. The Muslims tolerated Christianity, but they disestablished it; henceforward Christian life and liturgy, its endowments, politics and theology, {{would be a}} private and not a public affair. By an exquisite irony, Islam reduced the status of Christians to that which the Christians had earlier thrust upon the Jews, with one difference. The reduction in Christian status was merely judicial; it was unaccompanied by either systematic persecution or a blood lust, and generally, though not elsewhere and at all times, unmarred by vexatious behavior.|$|E

These efforts also led to a scandal when it was discovered millions of dollars {{had been given to}} foreign sales agents, with little or no record of who they were, or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> to earn the money.

As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle's village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others were to seize the Indians' belongings and horses.

Every man told her that they did <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> for their love to the dead chieftain. Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed. The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.|$|E
25|$|The older Calvinistic {{emphasis}} on free grace was given {{new life in}} Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men had faith in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no dread of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> because he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross.|$|E

Accordingly, when Edward III returned from Roxburgh in February 1335, it was to find the Bishop of Avranches waiting, demanding to know why Edward III was acting against David II and David's queen, Edward's own sister Joan. Edward III deferred his answer, {{but in the meantime}} agreed to allow the ambassadors to try to negotiate peace between England and Scotland. As serious as the French ambassadors may have been at their task, they were unable to make headway with the co-regents of David II, who were at this time divided by their own disagreements about governance. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> do, unwitting as they may have been, was allow time for the English to restore their finances.|$|E
25|$|Ranatunga {{went on to}} captain Sri Lanka in 1988, {{taking control}} of the {{national}} team for the next 11 years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit. He led the team to their greatest cricketing triumph, 1996 World Cup. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket's greatest prize. His strategies was commended by many cricketing greats and followed by other teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs as possible in the first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions. This strategy was perfectly executed by Sanath Jayasuriya. This strategy was still followed by the batsmen in the Powerplays.

25|$|The {{owner of}} the {{property}} in 1614 did not alter or further publicize the tomb.

In 1780 the then owners of the vineyard, the brothers Sassi, who apparently {{had no idea it}} was there, broke into the tomb again during remodelling of their wine cellar. They opened it to the leading scholars of the day. Someone, perhaps them, fragmented the slabs covering the loculi, with the obvious intent of accessing the contents, being careful to preserve the inscriptions. If the act is to be attributed to the Sassi, and if the motive of treasure-hunting is to be imputed to them, they found no treasure. <b>What</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> find they turned over to the Vatican under Pope Pius VI, including the gold signet ring taken off the finger bone of Barbatus.
