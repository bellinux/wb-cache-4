5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help his confidence throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that he <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, Gramsci {{died before}} he could {{completely}} articulate how hegemony mediates the subordinate classes in periods of relative calm or how to work against {{the powers of the}} ruling classes as exerted in this way. Importantly, however, he had vastly complicated the ways that later Marxists <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> mediation: as a means of persuasion utilized by the ruling classes, rather than as complete control of the available ideas within a given culture (ideology).|$|E
25|$|So Kock went {{directly}} to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised. Kock managed to convince him, however, and on December 31, the President promised that he <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his plan. But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which contained not a single word about {{this or any other}} colonial plan.|$|E
500|$|In {{a recent}} book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that [...] "Chadwick did {{more than any other}} {{scientist}} to give Churchill the Bomb.... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." [...] So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in [...] "looking forward" [...] to the Bomb's prospects.|$|E

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done.

500|$|During rehearsals {{and even}} during {{the run of the}} show, the music was {{repeatedly}} revised by Rodgers in an attempt to gear the songs to Traubel's voice. According to Bruce Pomahac of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, [...] "as she began to get cold feet about what her New York fans <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her as a belter, the keys of each of her numbers edged upward." [...] One of Traubel's numbers saw three different versions before being scrapped in favor of, according to Pomahac, [...] "something that sounded like an excerpt from Traubel’s Vegas act." [...] "All At Once You Love Her" [...] saw some popularity when recorded, during the run of the show, by Perry Como; in what Pomahac speculates was an attempt to appease Traubel, a reprise of the song was added for her, and provided [...] "one of the loveliest moments in all of Pipe Dream". The Organization announced that a new vocal score would be published in 2012, though it has not appeared as of 2017—the existing score reflects revisions made when Nancy Andrews took over the part.|$|E
500|$|At this point, Team International's Sabin and Shelley took {{advantage}} of their well-developed teamwork, having worked together as the Motor City Machine Guns since 2006, by double-teaming Dr. Wagner Jr. to allow Shelley to eliminate the Doctor over 47 minutes into the match. Just over a minute later Shocker and Último Guerrero countered one of Corleone's high flying moves to pin and eliminate Corleone from Team International. A double Superkick to Shocker allowed Shelley and Sabin to eliminate him, leaving Último Guerrero as {{the only member of}} Team Mexico. Último Guerrero was able to pin Chris Sabin, leaving only himself and Shelley. In the closing moments of the match, Último Guerrero managed to pin Sabin, eliminating him from the match. Minutes later Alex Shelley locked in a submission hold, then pulled Guerrero's mask off in the process out of view of the referee. The hold and Guerrero's attempts to cover his face led to Último Guerrero submitting to the hold moments later, giving Alex Shelley the victory and the International Gran Prix trophy. After the match Último Guerrero challenged Alex Shelley to a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", where Shelly would risk his hair against Guerrero's wrestling mask. Shelly said he <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it and would give Guerrero an answer after {{he had a chance to}} relax.|$|E

2500|$|Before leaving Washington D.C. for the Territory of Idaho, Edgerton had {{a private}} meeting with President Abraham Lincoln, in which he asked for the {{position}} of Territorial Governor of Montana. [...] Lincoln told Edgerton that he <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. Edgerton then left for the west, unsure {{of whether or not}} he would have a new position when he arrived, but on May 23, 1864, while on his way home, Mary Edgerton had a baby girl. She named her Idaho, unknowing {{of the fact that it}} was now the Territory of Montana.

2500|$|I {{got a job}} on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a {{week for}} myself, my horse, {{and the man who}} looked after it. I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E

2500|$|The Escape {{sequences}} {{were made}} {{to appeal to the}} players' instinctive desires; Uchikoshi wanted the player to experience the instinctive pleasure of [...] "I found it!". For the puzzles, Uchikoshi <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the details within the overall story, and the gimmicks and props found in the game; after deciding on them, they were integrated with the puzzles. He would also use puzzle-related websites as reference. He did not handle puzzle design himself, instead leaving a lot of the direction to other staff, and checking it multiple times. Because of the puzzle–story integration, the development team tried to avoid situations where the player gets stuck due to being unable to solve a puzzle, by including hints that would appear if the player repeatedly clicked on items; as the player continues clicking, the hints get more obvious, to the point of almost revealing the solution outright. In the second game, a difficulty setting was added, with puzzles being easier to solve on lower settings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
