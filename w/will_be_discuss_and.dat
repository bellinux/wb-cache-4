40|$|One of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} reading-pice for education with ethical and esthetical value for the children in the early child education at the family and in the kindergarten is the story. The story has big importance for education process in early childhood and for the school period of child development. As a meter of fact on that age with specifically language and statement the story offers possibility to see the beauty of art expression, to wake up the esthetical sense and with that procedure to prepare the child for easier perceive and understanding the complex contents of other literature zanres. So, through the world of the story, the child penetrates into the world of great literature, and here it found the perspective of forming their person. The story educates the child. It includes the ethical, esthetical and creativity in child’s spirit. The story strings into the child emotionality, it creates rich child vocabulary, it takes care about child spirit, and it makes the child able for life. With one word-the story is one of the original literatures zanier, which organize the child world and define child thinking from amorphous and diffuse aspect. The problem of the story interpretation is the problem, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>and</b> debate for all of time. Key words: story, child education, early school age, patriotism. ...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{environmental}} assessment methods attempt to measure {{improvements in the}} environmental performance of buildings relative to current typical practice or requirements. The assumption is that by continually improving the environmental performance of individual buildings, the collective reduction in resource use and ecological loadings by the building industry will be sufficient to fully address the environmental agenda. The choice of the term ‘green building assessment ’ {{is seen as a}} useful term to convey this intent. Several environmental methodologies and methods for evaluating environmental performance of buildings are being currently developed. In a global scale it is worth mentioning SB (Sustainable Building) Tool, formerly known as GB Tool (Green Building Tool) which is an international project coordinated from Canada, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) a method developed in the USA with a world wide application and CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency), a method developed in Japan. In Europe, some of the most frequently used include BREEAM (Building Research Establish Environmental Assessment Method) in the UK and also it is worth mentioning the HQE (High Environmental Quality) developed in France during the last decade and the VERDE method developed recently in Spain (Maria Sinou 2006). In this paper several method <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>and</b> will become main references for developing Sustainable building Tool for Malaysia...|$|E
