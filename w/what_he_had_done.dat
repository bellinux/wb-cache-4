5|$|Bart {{talks to}} Edna after class {{and starts to}} feel worse {{about what he did}} when he is unable to console her. He tells the family <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and the Simpsons then write a romantically poetic and {{diplomatic}} letter to tell her how Woodrow must leave, which makes Edna feel better.|$|E
5|$|Abra {{arrived back}} in Holby {{towards the end}} of series 8, {{immediately}} becoming embroiled in an illegal porcine kidney transplantation on renal patient Pete Golding. When Ric discovered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> the deception strained their friendship, and Abra came close to losing his job. Eventually, Ric decided the pressure of covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|The Multnomah {{name for}} Mount Hood was Wy'east. In {{one version of}} the legend, the two sons of the Great Spirit Sahale {{fell in love with}} the {{beautiful}} maiden Loowit, who could not decide which to choose. The two braves, Wy'east and Pahto, burned forests and villages in their battle over her. Sahale became enraged and smote the three lovers. Seeing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> he erected three mountain peaks to mark where each fell. He made beautiful Mount St. Helens for Loowit, proud and erect Mount Hood for Wy'east, and the somber Mount Adams for the mourning Pahto.|$|E

5000|$|From the PAP {{definition}} [...] "a {{person is}} morally responsible for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> only if <b>he</b> could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise", Frankfurt infers {{that a person}} is not morally responsible for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> if <b>he</b> could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise - a point with which he takes issue: our theoretical ability to do otherwise, he says, does not necessarily make it possible for us to do otherwise.|$|R
5|$|The first {{military}} execution in the war's western theater occurred on March 27, 1863, at Camp Burnside (Burnside Barracks). Robert Gay, a 27-year-old schoolteacher from Clay County, Indiana, was executed by a 20-man firing squad. After his capture by Confederates at Richmond, Kentucky, Gay declared {{allegiance to the}} Confederate States of America to escape further army service. After his return to Indiana, Gay was convicted of treason and executed, but not before he apologized for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Other executions took place in 1864, when three bounty jumpers were executed at Burnside Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> {{confessed to the}} police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E

5|$|Parcells {{first year}} proved difficult. In {{his first major}} {{decision}} as head coach, he decided to bench Simms in favor of Brunner based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in the 1981 season after Simms was injured. At first it appeared that Parcells' decision was justified, especially after a 27–3 victory over the Green Bay Packers gave the Giants a 2–2 record after 4 games. However, the Giants collapsed from there. The team went winless in their next seven games, losing six and garnering a tie with the St. Louis Cardinals, before defeating the Philadelphia Eagles to end the streak. The Giants then lost their remaining games to finish with a 3-12-1 record, including a 1-6-1 division record and a 1-7 home record (their only win was the game against the Packers; they defeated the Eagles at Veterans Stadium and their first win came at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium against the Falcons). Brunner had a subpar season, completing just 49.2% of his passes and throwing 9 touchdowns against 22 interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Phrynichus, {{fearing that}} Alcibiades if {{restored}} would avenge himself upon {{him for his}} opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, {{to tell him that}} Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation {{of the rest of the}} intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at Magnesia and communicated to them Phrynichus's letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E
25|$|At some point, McCroskey used {{a digital}} camera to record a video of himself, {{according}} to Ennis. In the video, he indicated that {{he knew he had}} to pay for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> and contemplated suicide, Ennis said.|$|E

25|$|In {{the evening}} of 6 December, police {{announced}} that a 14-year-old resident of Isfiya admitted to inadvertently starting the fire. The teen told investigators that after smoking a nargila, he threw a lit coal into an open area and was so shocked by the result that he returned to school without telling anyone <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sugihara {{died the}} {{following}} year {{at a hospital in}} Kamakura, on 31 July 1986. In spite of the publicity given him in Israel and other nations, he remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, showed up at his funeral, did his neighbors find out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> He may have lost his diplomatic career but he received much posthumous acclaim.|$|E

25|$|The {{form of the}} {{covenant}} resembles the suzerainty treaty in the ancient Near East. Like the treaties, the Ten Commandments begins with Yahweh's identification and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for Israel ("who brought {{you out of the}} land of Egypt"; Ex 20:2) as well as the stipulations commanding absolute loyalty ("You shall not have other gods apart from me"). Unlike the suzerainty treaty, the Decalogue does not have any witness nor explicit blessings and curses. The fullest account of the Mosaic covenant is given in the book of Deuteronomy.|$|E
25|$|After the detonation, Salmide {{presented}} {{himself to the}} French resistance and reported <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> The resistance hid him from the German forces who had branded him a traitor and ordered that he be arrested or shot on sight. Salmide spent {{the last months of}} the war in hiding with a French woman whose grandson, Alain Moga, would later serve as Bordeaux's deputy mayor. He hid from both the Gestapo and French police and later recalled that French officials nearly shot him after the war because of his German military service.|$|E
25|$|When Cecil landed his forces, they {{realised}} {{that they}} had no food or drink with them. Cecil then made the foolish decision to allow the men to drink from the wine vats found in the local houses. A wave of drunkenness ensued, with few or none of Cecil's force remaining sober. Realizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> Cecil took the only course left open to him, and ordered that the men return to their ships and retreat. When the Spanish army arrived, they found over 1,000 English soldiers still drunk: although every man was armed, not a single shot was fired as the Spanish put them all to the sword.|$|E

25|$|At the {{foundation}} of the University of Berlin (1810), in which he took a prominent part, Schleiermacher obtained a theological chair, and soon became secretary to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He took a prominent part in the reorganization of the Prussian church, and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the Lutheran and Reformed divisions of German Protestantism, paving the way for the Prussian Union of Churches (1817). The twenty-four years of his professional career in Berlin began with his short outline of theological study (Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums, 1811), in which he sought to do for theology <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for religion in his Speeches.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2007, Tulowitzki turned {{just the}} 13th unassisted triple play in MLB history, during a 9–7 home victory at Coors Field over the Atlanta Braves. As of 2009, {{eight of the}} 15 unassisted triple plays {{have been made by}} a shortstop. In the top of the seventh, Tulowitzki caught third baseman Chipper Jones' line drive with the runners moving, then stepped on second base to retire Kelly Johnson and tagged Édgar Rentería – who made no attempt to escape – before he could return to first base. Confused and not realizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> Tulowitzki went back and tagged second again, then threw the ball to Helton at first, neither of which was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{initially}} pleading {{not guilty}} to the remaining five murder charges on September 13, 1988, with the agreement of his two defense attorneys, Berdella ultimately conducted a plea bargain with the prosecutors to avoid {{the death penalty in}} these remaining charges. In this plea bargain, Berdella agreed to confess in graphic detail as to precisely whom he had killed, precisely what indignities he had subjected each victim to, how he had killed each victim, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with their bodies. These confessions were given to prosecutors between December 13 and December 15, 1988. In return for his cooperation, the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty at a formal hearing scheduled for 9 a.m on December 19.|$|E
