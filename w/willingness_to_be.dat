5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> photographed indicates that they knew {{that no one would}} be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E

He also strongly contended that Illinois had waived its immunity by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states to have waived immunity by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois had to have been aware of the possibility that entering the program would waive its own immunity, and its decision to participate in light of that danger showed a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held liable.|$|E

The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits, the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Geri Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress has achieved iconic status, {{becoming one of the}} most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture. The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop icons is also attributed to their vast merchandising and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of a media-driven world.

25|$|In {{the months}} prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much {{speculation}} as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced the Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay for health care {{services}} in contingent valuation studies should be assessed ex ante from an insurance perspective.

Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI {{for as many as}} 10–45 years. More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post-injury sexual functioning. Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners, <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sexually experimental, and good communication. Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships. For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction. For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.|$|E

Specifically, these two experiments demonstrate that <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay for an alternative in a menu can be manipulated without changing the objective quality of those alternatives because <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>is</b> correlated with an alternative’s quality z-score. This result is an artifact of the difficulty of translating psychological values (preferences) into numerical values (<b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay) combined with the comparative nature of the menu context...|$|R

To foster a critical mind, he suggests, the teacher ought to show the students the consequences of pursuing one's feelings over one's thoughts. For example, the teacher might allow students to choose a field trip between two different locations: one fantastic place which is given a dull overview, and a shabby place which is recommended by impressive advertisements. In teaching history, the teacher might examine a particular event from a multitude of different perspectives, and allow the students to use their critical faculties to make assessments of each.

However, the Phillies management (including general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. and president Dave Montgomery) did not think a fire sale would benefit the organization. According to Amaro: [...] Marlon Byrd and closer Jonathan Papelbon were top trade candidates because of other teams' needs and the fact that neither had no-trade clauses. Papelbon expressed a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traded, saying that it was [...] "mind-boggling" [...] to him that some players would prefer to remain on a losing team. According to a USA Today article: [...] Although Amaro announced Cole Hamels' availability, his high asking price hindered the possibility of a deal. Cliff Lee had been available, but after re-injuring his elbow (and probably missing the rest of the season) the possibility of a deal evaporated. The non-waiver trade deadline passed with no trades by the Phillies. Amaro was harshly criticized for holding onto Papelbon, Byrd, Hamels, Lee, A. J. Burnett and Antonio Bastardo. Although they did not make a deal before the non-waiver trading deadline, the team could still move a player on waivers; they did so, trading Roberto Hernandez to the Dodgers on August 7 for two players to be named later. The first named player was Jesmuel Valentin, son of former major leaguer José Valentín and a switch-hitting second baseman called a [...] "breakout candidate" [...] by a Baseball Prospectus writer. Observers generally considered Valentin a good fit for the Phillies, since the team did not give up much in return. Several weeks later the Phillies acquired their second named player, right-handed pitcher Victor Arano, to complete the trade.
