500|$|The Russian market, Nokian Tyres' largest, contributed 34% of the {{net sales}} and {{captured}} 26% of the Russian winter tyre market. CEO Kim Gran describes the Russian consumer as having a [...] "love affair" [...] with the Nokian brand citing that it stems from tyres which fits the local weather conditions and a genuine need in the market. The use of <b>winter</b> <b>tyres,</b> which has softer rubber compounds than all-season tyres, results in improved starting, stopping, and steering performance. The Hakkapeliitta brand was, at one time, the only Western tyre brand in Russia having entered the market during the Soviet era in 1964. In contrast to having a Russian tyre factory to benefit from lower tariffs, another tyre company, Continental AG, abandoned Russian tyre production and hopes for Russian membership in the World Trade Organisation will result in lower import tariffs.|$|E
50|$|Cadence braking (or {{any other}} type of braking) will not help much on {{extremely}} slippery surfaces such as ice (in theory it would, but in practice the ice can be so slippery that it makes little difference—a <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> would make more difference). Also, on very loose surfaces, a quicker stop can be achieved by simply locking the wheels, causing a wedge of loose material to build up ahead of the wheels and create a substantial braking force. This is useful only when stopping in a straight line, because locking the wheels means all steering control would be lost. In such conditions, ABS actually increases the stopping distances. On poor surfaces, in the past, rally drivers timed the pulsing of brake application so as {{to take advantage of the}} load transfer as the vehicle pitches forwards and backwards in response to the initial braking effort. With modern, over-dampened, and stiffly sprung suspensions this is less likely to be effective.|$|R
5000|$|The R8, {{like most}} mid- or rear-engine {{designed}} sports cars, utilises wider {{wheels and tyres}} on its rear axle. For the 18-inch alloy wheels (on standard summer tyres), there is just one range of sizes—the fronts are sized at 8.5J×18H2 ET42, whilst the rears are two inches wider at 10.5Jx18H2 ET50. With the 19-inch wheels (standard fit in most markets), the theme continues—the fronts are all 8.5J×19H2 ET42, and the rears are 11.0Jx19H2 ET50. 19-inch wheels for the <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> package have a ½" [...] narrower rear compared to the summer tyre wheel package. There is also a corresponding difference in tyre sizes—18's are 235/40 ZR18 95Y XL (eXtra Load) in front and 285/35 ZR18 101Y XL at the rear. For the 19-inch tyres, two different options are available—all fronts are 235/35 ZR19 91Y, and the rears are either 295/30 ZR19 100Y XL or 305/30 ZR19 102Y XL.

50|$|Ice {{and snow}} tend to {{accumulate}} {{on the roads}} during the <b>winter,</b> so <b>tyre</b> chains are given out. At these times the maximum speed is 40 km/h.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new retreaded passenger car tyres classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without special aggregates mixed into the tread rubber compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum braking friction corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> can get about 30 % improved braking friction and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth flooded ice with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|R

30|$|Aside {{from the}} overall safety {{effects of these}} tyre types, a more {{specific}} and long discussed issue has been whether studded tyres prevent wintry roads from becoming over-polished, and whether a certain proportion {{of them would be}} needed for the sake of safety. This cannot of course be answered with a single figure, since the degree of slipperiness varies with the weather conditions and is mitigated by several approaches with concurrent effects, such as <b>winter</b> maintenance and <b>tyre</b> properties. Nevertheless, the question is currently relevant, as the use of studded tyres is discouraged by many cities in the Nordic countries due to their adverse health effects [9].|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{handling}} {{evaluation is}} {{a crucial part of}} the vehicle development process. The evaluation can be done in two ways, subjectively; by expert test drivers or objectively; by performing repeatable standard manoeuvres usually by steering robots. Subjective testing is resource intensive as prototypes need to be built. Objective testing is less so, as it can be performed in a virtual environment in conjunction with physical testing. In an e˙ort to reduce resources and time used in vehicle development, manufacturers are looking to objective testing to assess vehicle behaviour. Vehicle handling testing in winter strongly relies on subjective testing. This thesis aims to investigate into the usage of objective test strategy to assess vehicle handling behaviour in winter conditions. Manoeuvres and metrics are defined for summer con-ditions, but not for winter. Hence the goal was to define new or modified metrics and manoeuvres custom to winter testing. Data from an objective winter test was obtained and analysed. The manoeuvres used were constant radius (CR), frequency response (FR), sine with dwell (SWD) and throt-tle release in turn (TRIT). The manoeuvres were compared to public standards from the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and National Highway Traÿc Safety Administration (NHTSA) as well as the vehicle manufacturer standards. The data from a reference vehicle is compared to that from three configuration vehicles, one without anti-roll bar in the front, one without rear anti-roll bar and a standard. The di˙erence in the signals between reference and configuration vehicles is compared to the spread in data of the reference vehicle to determine the signal-to-noise ratio in the manoeuvres. The spread of reference data is analysed to determine the distribu-tion and to di˙erentiate between the two test days. To replicate vehicle behaviour in simulation, <b>winter</b> <b>tyre</b> models using brush and Magic Formula model equations were investigated. These were used in a bicycle and a VI-CarRealTime model. The perfor-mance of these are checked and compared. The bicycle model is used in an unscented Kalman filter, to investigate potential improvements in signal processing. The metrics obtained from the study of standards are checked for robustness in winter conditions by analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. The procedure of selection of metrics from the ANOVA results is explained. Further, the manoeuvres are modified virtually in VI-CarRealTime, from the results of a sensitivity analysis. The di˙erence in metrics between reference and configuration vehicles is maximized. The final results of the thesis were; a test plan with modified manoeuvres and a set of robust metrics. Also containing important information to aid in the execution of the tests. The conclusions drawn were that the noise in winter testing is high, but the di˙erence between vehicles is statistically significant for some robust metrics. The metrics related to yaw rate were in general more robust. Open-loop throttle and steering control in manoeuvres should be avoided as far as possible. A bicycle model is not complex enough to represent vehicle behaviour at high slip angles. Performance increase of a UKF is not justified as to the e˙ort involved...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} project {{discussed in this}} paper was designed to subject the rolling noise measuring method based on a single-axle trailer, which had been worked out in the {{research project}} 'Development of a measuring method for tyre-road noise' (Project No. 105 05 211) in 1990, to detailed practical testing. The necessary tyre-road noise measurements were performed on {{a representative sample of}} commercial car tyres (n = 143). Apart from summer tyres, a limited number of <b>winter</b> and cross-country <b>tyres</b> were included in the sample. Tests also included remoulds as well as new tyres. Measurements were made on two different surfaces, an 0 / 8 asphalt concrete and 0 / 11 mastic asphalt. The former surface corresponds to the requirements of ISO standard 10844 (surface for vehicle homologation tests); the latter is typical for roads outside built-up areas. The study showed that the trailer drive-by method is fundamentally suitable for determining sound emission from car tyres. To ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, the tractor vehicle must, however, be fitted with especially low-noise tyres and additional screening in the tyre area. In certain cases (when very low-noise tyres are being measured) the above steps are insufficient to guarantee a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB(A) (minimum signal-to-noise ratio: 7 dB(A)). This problem was, however, solved by means of special 'calibration drives' with the tractor vehicle and by subtracting the tractor vehicle energy component. (orig.)

40|$|To {{cope with}} winter weather conditions, {{potentially}} including snow and ice, {{it is common}} to use <b>winter</b> <b>tyres,</b> or "all-seasons" tyres assumed to be safe both in summer and winter. In some northern countries, <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are mandatory. It is commonly assumed that <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are noisier than normal tyres (here called summer tyres) and <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> equipped with studs are assumed to be extra noisy. This paper presents a study where noise and rolling resistance properties of tyres for winter conditions are compared to summer and all-season tyres. The <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> include types optimized for central European climate, tyres optimized for Nordic climate and tyres with studs. In total, approx. 50 car tyres have been tested. Noise properties have been measured with the CPX method and rolling resistance has been measured with a trailer method; all measurements made on two road surfaces; SMA 8 and DAC 16. Results indicate that <b>winter</b> <b>tyres</b> are not noisier than summer tyres; except for studded tyres. Despite high differences among individual tyres, rolling resistance is approximately similar among the main types; surprisingly including also studded tyres.
