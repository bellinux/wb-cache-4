5000|$|A large {{proportion}} of a semitrailer's weight {{is supported by a}} tractor unit, or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. A semitrailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semitrailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to bearing <b>wheel</b> <b>weight</b> factors. Semitrailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages.

5000|$|In 1974, Rokon {{produced}} the RT340 TCR Automatic, using a snowmobile-type Salsbury CVT, {{rear wheel drive}} only, and dual disc brakes. Another unusual feature was a pull cord to start the engine. The transmission freewheels with the engine at idle; starts to engage about 2800 RPM; and is tuned so the engine always runs near peak power, at 6,000 to 6,700 RPM. The lowest gear ratio is 3.76:1 and highest 0.87:1. Using a CVT allows a use of a 2-stroke cycle motor with higher power but narrow power band. The engine sound is unusual as the engine stays at a nearly fixed speed and the transmission ratio changes according to speed. The transmission freewheels when not driving forward, {{so there is no}} engine braking. The transmission is vented to the outside for cooling, and so is contaminated by stream crossings and other environmental exposure. Water causes slipping but quickly goes away; however grit can cause transmission sticking. Riding on loose surfaces is sometimes complicated, as rear wheel breakaway does not cause telltale changes in the engine sound. However, most other riding is intuitive and sometimes much more convenient as the automatic avoids engine stalls and other problems with gear selection. Operation is loud (90.3 dB(A)) as the engine is always running fast except at idle. Despite low front <b>wheel</b> <b>weight,</b> about 43%, it had trouble pulling wheelies, a problem for Enduro riding. Prototypes were raced by factory riders from 1971 to 1973 under Tom Clark; [...] "TCR" [...] stands for [...] "Tom Clark Replica".

This {{study investigated the}} effects of the combination of press <b>wheel</b> <b>weight</b> and soil moisture on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedling emergence and crop establishment. Also soil physical properties of the seedbed including soil moisture and bulk density were recorded.

A factorial complete block design was applied with three levels of soil moisture 7. 1, 14. 3 and 20. 6 % and four levels of press wheel weights which were 5. 4, 8. 3, 10. 2 and 10. 5 kg cm - 1 of press wheel width.

This rate was significantly higher (p=< 0. 05) where the combination of 14. 3 % soil moisture and the amount of 5. 4 kg cm - 1 width of press wheels were used.

40|$|This study {{documents}} that lead weights, {{which are used}} to balance motor vehicle wheels, are lost and deposited in urban streets, that they accumulate along the outer curb, {{and that they are}} rapidly abraded and ground into tiny pieces by vehicle traffic. The lead is so soft that half the lead deposited in the street is no longer visible after little more than 1 week. This lead loading of urban streets by motor vehicle wheel weights is continuous, significant, and widespread, and is potentially a major source of human lead exposure because the lead is concentrated along the outer curb where pedestrians are likely to step. Lead deposition at one intersection in Albuquerque, New Mexico, ranged from 50 to 70 kg/km/year (almost 11 g/ft 2 /year along the outer curb), a mass loading rate that, if accumulated for a year, would exceed federal lead hazard guidelines more than 10, 000 times.

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{studies were}} undertaken {{in order to}} examine the effects that both external weight distribution, and internal, bike-rider interface forces had on cyclists. The first section of the study looked at the bike-rider interface forces, and how they fluctuate during normal cycling; as well as how they vary with changes in rider power output, hand position, and cadence. In order to analyze these changes in isolation, three different studies were undertaken. The studies each examined 10 USAC Category 3 or better riders who were tested for 6 minute trials. Riders were tested with their hands on the tops, drops and hoods, with cadences of 60 - 90 RPM, and power outputs of 1 - 4 watts per kg. It was found that for each 1 W/kg power output increase, saddle forces decreased by 5. 2 percentage points and bottom bracket forces increased by 3. 3 percentage points. Cadence did not affect bike-rider interface forces. Shifting a rider 2 ̆ 7 s hands from the hoods to the tops and the drops increased the stem force by approximately 2 and 4 percentage points, respectively.
