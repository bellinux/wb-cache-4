5000|$|The FZML {{was founded}} in 1990 {{by members of the}} important/considerable Ensemble for avant-garde music in East Germany Gruppe Neue Musik Hanns Eisler and by other artists, authors, {{scientists}} and journalists. The common goal <b>was</b> to <b>spread</b> contemporary <b>music</b> and to foster a vital dialogue about music and arts in present time. In 1993, the concert series “MUSIK-ZEIT” (music-time) became the first big success of the FZML. Apart from many world premieres it was central to promote the international music scene. In addition, the first educational project (“Schulmusikkonzerte” school-music concerts) was established to communicate contemporary music to the up-growing generation.In 1999, Thomas Christoph Heyde [...] became the artistic director. One year later the FZML moved into its first business premises. Starting in 2001, the FZML mounted annually one festival and several concert series. This continuity strengthened the popularity of the society and the FZML became established as an inherent part of Leipzig’s cultural life. The governments of Leipzig, Saxony and even of the Federal Republic started to support the FZML. In 2006 the festival series “MachtMusik” started, in 2007 the concert series “FreiZeitArbeit” (FreeTimeWork/LeisureWork) followed. Some educational and social projects followed the next years. With the 20th anniversary, the friends’ association “Freunde und Förderer des FZML” was founded. It supports the work of the FZML financially and in non-material ways. Until now, the yearlong international festival “CAGE100” with its worldwide more than 100 events in 2012/’13 was the biggest project for the FZML since its founding.|$|R
