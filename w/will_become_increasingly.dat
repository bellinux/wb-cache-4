As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) Program.

Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.|$|E

In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have some fun with their witty banter."

2500|$|There {{are other}} {{undesirable}} rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments. [...] For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs {{gets into a}} state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost. [...] This happens {{for the same reason}} as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. [...] However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.|$|E
2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [...] So to make these things easier computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E

2500|$|Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is neuropathic pain {{which is}} caused by damage to the neurons in the brain (central nervous system), {{as the result of}} a {{vascular}} injury. One study found that up to 8% of people who have had a stroke will develop central post-stroke pain, and that the pain will be moderate to severe in 5% of those affected. [...] The condition was formerly called [...] "thalamic pain", because of the high incidence among those with damage to the thalamus or thalamic nuclei. Now known as CPSP, it is characterized by perceived pain from non-painful stimuli, such as temperature and light touch. This altered perception of stimuli, or allodynia, can be difficult to assess due to the fact that the pain can change daily in description and location, and can appear anywhere from months to years after the stroke. CPSP can also lead to a heightened central response to painful sensations, or hyperpathia. Affected persons may describe the pain as cramping, burning, crushing, shooting, pins and needles, and even bloating or urinary urgency. [...] Both the variation and mechanism of pain in CPSP have made it difficult to treat. Several strategies have been employed by physicians, including intravenous lidocaine, opioids/narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-epileptic medications and neurosurgical procedures with varying success. Higher rates of successful pain control in persons with CPSP can be achieved by treating other sequelae of stroke, such as depression and spasticity. As the age of the population increases, the diagnosis and management of CPSP <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> important to improve the quality of life of an increasing number of stroke survivors.|$|E

The portrait of the author, by White, which faced the title-page, is without doubt the best likeness that has ever appeared of our great allegorist.[1] In addition to this is a whole length figure of the author, with a representation of Heart-castle on his left breast; the town of Mansoul, behind, being partly seen through him; Emmanuel and his army on the heart side, and Diabolus with his dragons on his right.

There will be a progressive change in the apparatus and quality of human life--the sort of alteration of the percentages that causes no intellectual shock. Electric heating, for example, will become practicable in our houses, and then cheaper, and at last so cheap and good that nobody will burn coal any more.

A more systematic and understanding social science will be estimating the probable growth and movement of population, and planning town and country on lines that would seem to-day almost inconceivably wise and generous.
