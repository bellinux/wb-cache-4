5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium <b>worn</b> <b>off.</b> It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, {{the novelty}} of the Pendolino has <b>worn</b> <b>off</b> and VR has even used the train in {{regional}} traffic between Oulu and Rovaniemi due to rail works in summer 2011. The problematic tilting mechanism was not used during winter 2010–2011 and the time benefit of the tilting was not {{taken into account in}} timetables of winter 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments <b>worn</b> <b>off</b> the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
50|$|For this election, the {{opposition}} emphasized the <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> of Lula {{because of the}} Mensalão scandal, that involved the bribing of parliament members by the ruling coalition, which had been widely reported on the mass media since mid-2005. This <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> however, appealed only to middle-class voters.|$|R

[...] The invisibility also <b>wears</b> <b>off</b> in death, and Griffin's body becomes visible again.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of LSVT-BIG for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off</b> {{remains to be}} determined. Therefore, we evaluated whether LSVT-BIG improves motor disability in eight PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off.</b> Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, daily off time, and mobility assessments were evaluated during the “on” time {{before and after the}} LSVT-BIG course. LSVT-BIG significantly improved UPDRS III scores at 4 weeks and UPDRS II scores in the “off” state at 12 weeks, with no changes in the other measures. The findings suggest that LSVT-BIG may be an effective therapy for advanced PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off...</b>|$|R
5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely <b>worn</b> <b>off.</b> The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E

50|$|The Notholithocarpus (prev. Lithocarpus) densiflorus {{leaves are}} alternate, 7 - 15 cm, with toothed margins and a hard, {{leathery}} texture, and persist {{for three to}} four years. At first they are covered in dense orange-brown scurfy hairs on both sides, but those on the upper surface soon <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> those on the under surface persisting longer but eventually <b>wearing</b> <b>off</b> too.|$|R

25|$|The {{reaction}} in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well. Once the euphoria of victory had <b>worn</b> <b>off,</b> Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.|$|E
25|$|In the {{election}} of 1972, Stanfield's Tories campaigned on the public's perception that the Liberals were mismanaging the economy. Though the Liberals started high in the polls, Trudeau's popularity had <b>worn</b> <b>off</b> and they slumped due to a poor campaign. The Tories came within two seats of defeating the Liberal government. The Liberals dropped to a minority government and stayed in power for two years with support from David Lewis and the New Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|The terga on {{segments}} II through VI of {{the abdomen}} are dark {{and have an}} almost triangular silvery-white marking on the base that is not aligned with the silvery bands of scales on the ventral side of the abdomen. The triangular marking and the silvery band are only aligned on abdominal segment VII. The transparent wings have white spots {{on the base of}} the costae. With older mosquito specimens, the scales could be partially <b>worn</b> <b>off,</b> making these characteristics not stand out as much.|$|E

25|$|The bedeguar gall is {{surrounded}} by a dense mass of sticky branched filaments. This structure gives the appearance of a ball of moss, and its filaments are often brightly coloured, being at their best around September; starting off green and then passing through pink and crimson to reddish brown. A large specimen can be up to 10cm in width. The larvae develop and then over winter as pupae in the now brown and dry-looking structure, emerging in May. The unilarval chambers are set in a woody core which persists after the filaments have <b>worn</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
25|$|A runestone is {{typically}} a raised stone with a runic inscription, but the term {{can also be}} applied to inscriptions on boulders and on bedrock. The tradition began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, {{but most of the}} runestones date from the late Viking Age. Most runestones are located in Scandinavia, but there are also scattered runestones in locations that were visited by Norsemen during the Viking Age. Runestones are often memorials to dead men. Runestones were usually brightly coloured when erected, though this is no longer evident as the colour has <b>worn</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pilots, Naval Flight Officers, and Naval Aircrewmen are {{authorized}} to wear green or desert flight suits (made of nomex for fire protection), with rank insignia for officers stitched on the shoulders, and a name tag/warfare insignia {{on the left}} breast pocket. Either a Command/Navy ballcap or a Khaki Garrison Cap (for Commissioned Officers and CPOs) are worn with this uniform. Green flight suits are the standard wear; however, wing commanders may authorize desert flight suits for personnel located in hot climates. As of 2012, flight suits may now be <b>worn</b> <b>off</b> base {{in the same manner}} as the Navy Working Uniform.|$|E

25|$|The discs are {{commonly}} made from cast iron {{and a certain}} amount of surface rust is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is <b>worn</b> <b>off</b> again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.|$|E
25|$|Dry socket {{typically}} causes pain on {{the second}} to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the anesthesia/analgesia has <b>worn</b> <b>off,</b> (e.g., normal pain from surgical trauma or mandibular fracture) or has a more delayed onset (e.g., osteomyelitis, which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction). Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm saline and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis. Sometimes part of {{the root of the}} tooth or a piece of bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A dental radiograph (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment.|$|E
25|$|Thermal burns usually {{result from}} placing hot food or {{beverages}} in the mouth. This may occur {{in those who}} eat or drink before a local anesthetic has <b>worn</b> <b>off.</b> The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and {{this has led to}} a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.|$|E

25|$|The {{balance of}} power in the air was altered for the next few months. The Luftwaffe had {{attained}} air superiority, if not supremacy at this point. The low German opinion of Soviet combat capabilities had been confirmed, and was bolstered by information provided by captured VVS personnel. The Soviet bomber fleet had been practically destroyed and its remaining forces continued ineffective and costly attacks on the German rear, while Axis surprise and qualitative superiority nearly forced a collapse of Soviet air units. However, the VVS recovered once surprise had <b>worn</b> <b>off,</b> as indicated in the lessening losses on the ground, and rise of casualties in the air. The autumn weather also provided breathing space to partially rebuild. Moreover, a number of crews survived the initial strikes on the ground, to be redeployed afresh. The Luftwaffe had been unable to destroy the VVS for those reasons.|$|E
500|$|Analgesics {{should not}} be taken [...] "on demand" [...] but [...] "by the clock" [...] (every 3–6 hours), with each dose {{delivered}} before the preceding dose has <b>worn</b> <b>off,</b> in doses sufficiently high to ensure continuous pain relief. People taking slow-release morphine should also be provided with immediate-release ("rescue") morphine to use as necessary, for pain spikes (breakthrough pain) that are not suppressed by the regular medication.|$|E
