40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> {{information exchange}} as alternative means to tax international interest income. For each regime, {{we consider the}} maximum level of taxation of foreign-source income that can be sustained as the equilibrium of a repeated game. The best regime {{is the one that}} brings the level of taxation in the repeated game closest to the cooperative level of interest taxation. Sustainable levels of taxation in either regime depend on the importance of bank profits and on the marginal cost of public funds, among other things. Simulations with the model illustrate the choice between <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> information exchange. An explicit possibility is the emergence of a mixed regime, with one country imposing a <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> the other country providing information. The basic model is extended to allow for size differences between the two countries and to incorporate a third, outside country. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{tax policy}} measures to reduce corporate tax avoidance by extending taxation in the source country without imposing double taxation. We focus on four options: Bilaterally restricting interest and royalty deductibility, introducing an inverted tax credit system, levying <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on all interest and royalty payments <b>and</b> levying <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> as an anti-avoidance regulation. We calculate the tax revenue effects of introducing a minimum <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> on royalty payments <b>and</b> an inverted <b>tax</b> credit. For the <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> {{we find that}} the US would suffer the greatest tax revenue losses, while some other countries would increase their tax revenue.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of taxpayer-specific information between {{national tax authorities}} has recently emerged as a key and controversial topic in international tax policy discussions, most notably with the OECD s harmful <b>tax</b> practices project <b>and</b> the EU s savings tax initiative.

Amongst the findings are that: (i) the transfer of <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> receipts to the residence country, as planned in the EU, has no effect on equilibrium tax rates, but acts purely as a lump sum transfer; (ii) in contrast, allocating some of the revenue from information exchange to the source country counter to usual practice (though no less so than the EU agreement) would have adverse strategic effects on total revenue; (iii) nevertheless, any <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> regime is Pareto dominated by information exchange combined with appropriate revenue sharing; and, in particular, (iv) sharing of the additional revenues raised from information provided, while efficiency-reducing, could be in the interests of large (high-tax) countries as a means of persuading small (low-tax) countries to provide that information voluntarily. ...|$|R
