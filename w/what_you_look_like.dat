But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> but on what you're saying".|$|E

The next day, he was interviewed at length by Katie Couric on the Today show. The tearful interview, which NBC did not interrupt with normally scheduled station breaks, was described a year later by USA Today as [...] "one of the most indelible moments of the tragedy". Craig wrote of his sister Rachel, [...] "...her love for people was less conditional than anyone I knew... It didn't matter to her <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> or who your friends were. Another thing I liked and respected so much was that she made it clear... what her beliefs were".|$|R

50|$|In {{the fourth}} season of Drake & Josh, Peck was noticeably thinner. He said I made a {{conscious}} effort to lose weight because I knew I could be happier as well as being healthier. I started by going on a diet {{a year and a half}} ago and I got a personal trainer, but I definitely have a healthier lifestyle now. Also I feel that because I do so much television, I am a better role model. I don't really understand why I should be a role model, but I know that kids do look up to me, so it is my responsibility to motivate people and be inspiring. I hope that I can do that for kids. It doesn't really matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> though. He is also a prominent personality on the video-sharing services Vine and Snapchat.

5000|$|I wasn’t {{completely}} {{aware of}} the Nothing roster and the philosophy of Nothing Records. But as I began the relationship and looked around, and found {{out what it was}} setting out to do, I was just thrilled {{to be a part of}} it. It’s a label that works very much on artistic purity, it’s not one that takes and steers the artists in various ways of making the hit record. They just look at you for what your worth is in terms of the music that you present to them. They seem to become involved based on what they hear coming out of the speakers, not <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> what you’re image is. It’s just what’s coming out of the speakers. If they can relate to that, then you can be a part of the Nothing organization. It’s a very respective and eclectic bunch of people that Trent has put together. He’s the man responsible for the signing on his label.|$|E
