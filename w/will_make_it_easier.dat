Neohumanism will give new inspiration and provide a new interpretation for the very idea of human existence.

Sarkar enounces that though physically different, all existence is metaphysically united and fundamentally one collective body composed of all the material and supra-material elements of this universe. Hence PROUT propounds the celebration of diversity and multiculturalism, emphasizing, through its policies, the abolishment of inequality in all its forms, be that religious superiority, racism, sexism, prejudices against social groups, etc. According to Sarkar, PROUT treads a path of socio-economic liberation for the common people [...] , where the desire for a more progressive society is driven by Neohumanistic values stirred by the ancient philosophies of the east.|$|E
