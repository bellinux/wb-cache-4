25|$|In 1933, Shindo, then {{living with}} his brother in Onomichi, was {{inspired}} by a film called Bangaku No Isshō to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> career in films.

At this time he learned that films were based on scripts because old scripts were used as toilet paper. He would take the scripts home to study them. His job involved drying 200-foot lengths of film on a roller three metres long and two metres high, and he learned the relationship between the pieces of film he was drying and the scripts he read.|$|E

2500|$|Although Fermi {{calculations}} {{are often}} not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does {{tell us what to}} look for to get a better answer.

[...] It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>a</b> store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme reasonable values that could appear in each of our assumptions).|$|E
