2500|$|Despite {{design and}} {{assembly}} improvements, Fordsons still required {{a high level}} of maintenance. A farmer near Atlanta in 1921 listed the cost of his Fordson repairs for the year as $1,246. He recorded problems in his diary, noting difficulty starting the engine, a broken <b>wheel,</b> <b>engine</b> failure and the rear end bursting throughout January, totaling costs of $1,301 for 620 hours of work. A Colorado farmer telephoned his dealer three times a day to complain about his Fordson. The most dangerous feature would occur when a towed implement became immoveable: the stoppage of the implement would cause a reaction through the transmission that would flip the tractor over backwards, sometimes killing the driver. This condition was introduced when the worm drive was relocated below the main drive pinion, relieving the driver from the heat it generated but also causing a torque on the tractor that lightened the load on the front wheels. One Indiana farmer believed the Fordson to be so dangerous that it should have been banned by law. The Eastern Implement Dealer claimed that Fordsons killed 36 drivers in 1918. Pipp's Weekly further claimed that Fordsons had killed 136 men up to August 1922. Ford spokesmen maintained the accidents resulted from inexperienced drivers, saying any tractor could be dangerous if improperly handled. Satisfied customers praised the Fordson, saying it made farm work easier and performed ideally in orchards and truck farms. Judging from the Fordson's market share in the late teens and early 20s, the anecdotal horror stories, while extreme, must have been relative outliers (that is, the notion that [...] "all Fordsons flip over backwards and burst at the seams" [...] was an exaggeration). Nonetheless, it became imprinted in many minds and became a punch line. The [...] "Hoyt-Clagwell" [...] tractor on the 1960s TV sitcom Green Acres was a Fordson Model F. It was known to randomly 'explode' followed by {{one or both of the}} rear wheels falling off.|$|E
5000|$|The Forester XTI concept vehicle {{uses the}} 2.5-liter {{intercooled}} turbo engine from Subaru WRX STI, six-speed manual transmission, 18 × 8-inch S204 forged alloy wheels with Yokohama Advan Neova 255/40R18 performance tires, adjustable coil-over suspension, Brembo brakes with four-piston front calipers, 2-piston rear calipers, Super Sport ABS and Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), leather and Alcantara sport seats, a special instrument cluster, front dash and center console and leather-wrapped steering <b>wheel.</b> <b>Engine</b> is rated [...] and 300 lbft Nm torque.|$|E
5000|$|Codenamed R17, the Audi A5 DTM is a {{race car}} {{designed}} for the DTM beginning in year 2012, replacing the Audi A4 DTM. It includes a V8 engine rated at [...] with 6-speed transmission (from previous A4 DTM car), pneumatically operated using paddle shifters in the steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>engine</b> electronics (Bosch MS 5.1) and the central display from Audi R8 LMS, larger and wider tires from Hankook, 120-litre safety fuel tank inside carbon fiber cell, and a larger rear wing. The prototype was built by Audi Sport in Ingolstadt.|$|E
50|$|This was a Monkey bike style machine {{which used}} the {{standard}} Lambretta <b>wheels,</b> <b>engine</b> and transmission. However it had heavily modified forks and {{a completely different}} frame. The Xispa was in production from 1971-1979.|$|R
50|$|The oaken paddlewheel, rebuilt in 1980, is {{approximately}} 32 feet in diameter. It was powered by two Marietta compound stem <b>wheel</b> <b>engines</b> that required 25 to 75 tons of coal a day. These engines produced 1,000 horsepower.|$|R
50|$|Between 1869 and 1873, new {{locomotives}} {{were built}} to replace {{four of the}} original 9 ft diameter driving <b>wheeled</b> <b>engines,</b> re-using the engine numbers of the locomotives being replaced. These four replacement engines had slightly smaller 8 ft diameter driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|On a scooter, a pressed-steel full {{enclosure}} {{under the}} seat encases the rear <b>wheel,</b> <b>engine</b> and gearbox. In order to remain within its operating temperature range, a cooling fan {{was added to the}} air-cooled MZ engine. Powering this fan sapped the engine's already inadequate 5 PS power output. IWL copied Glas and Heinkel by giving the Pitty a large fairing that enveloped the front wheel. This increased the scooter's weight to 139 kg, which was heavy for its class and further impeded its under-powered performance. IWL claimed a 70 km/h top speed, but in practice this was seldom achieved.|$|E
50|$|A spiral pump , {{sometimes}} called a Wirtz pump, {{is a low}} lift pump which is composed of a long piece of metal plating, which is wound into a coil and sealed {{at the top and}} back extremities so as to resemble a cylinder. The outer cavity serves as the inlet, while the inner (partial) tube serves as the outlet. A coiled plastic tube will suffice for this arrangement. The outlet pipe is fixed to a water <b>wheel,</b> <b>engine</b> or animal which is capable of rotating the pump quickly. Due to this rotation, water is picked up by the outer cavity and pumped upwards in the hose.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{performance}} upgrades {{were available for}} Vitesses, during and after production. Many were provided by SAH Accessories, later owned by Dunham and Haines in Dunstable, north of London. The [...] "Tite-a-turn" [...] modification {{was an attempt to}} tame the early swing axle suspension by increasing the resistance to suspension extension on the inside rear wheel (and the transition into positive camber) while allowing normal compression into negative camber on the outer <b>wheel.</b> <b>Engine</b> modifications went from simple cosmetics like an alloy rocker cover to more serious changes. Alloy manifolds for triple twin-choke Weber or Dellorto carburetors were available and gave considerable improvements in acceleration and top speed especially if coupled with SAH's tubular exhaust manifolds (2x3 into 1, then 2 into 1), straight through rear box/twin boxes and camshaft changes.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{commands}} {{would be}} {{passed from the}} senior officer on the bridge to stations dispersed throughout the ship, where physical control of the ship was exercised, as technology did not exist for the remote control of steering or machinery. Helm orders would be passed to an enclosed wheel house, where the coxswain or helmsman operated the ship's <b>wheel.</b> <b>Engine</b> commands would be relayed to the engineer in the engine room by an engine order telegraph that displayed the captain's orders on a dial. The engineer would ensure that the correct combination of steam pressure and engine revolutions were applied. The bridge was often open to the elements, therefore a weatherproof pilot house could be provided, from which a pilot, who was traditionally the ship's navigating officer, could issue commands from shelter.|$|E
5000|$|For 1990, DeVille and Fleetwood {{lost their}} {{telescopic}} steering column, but retained the tilt feature {{in exchange for}} an airbag mounted onto the newly standard leather-trimmed steering <b>wheel.</b> <b>Engine</b> output was up an additional [...] from sequential multi-port fuel injection. 1990 models also received GM's PASS Key theft-deterrent system which used a coded electronic pellet embedded into the ignition key. Other new features for 1990 included a non-illuminated vanity mirror on the driver's visor (a passenger side visor mirror had been standard equipment for decades now), door edge guards (previously optional), [...] "clam shell" [...] front center armrest with storage, and manual seat-back recliners for driver and passenger. While Lincoln's Continental did not fare well against DeVille, a new sales threat—aimed directly at Cadillac—came from the 1990 debut of Toyota's Lexus LS400 and the Infiniti Q45 from Nissan. Additionally, the Acura Legend—Honda's high-end label—had been gaining momentum in the luxury market since its 1986 introduction.|$|E
50|$|In {{production}} {{the complete}} power unit was {{carried on a}} special front fork, with the 104 cc two-stroke engine on the left with its main-shaft run through the wheel spindle to a flywheel. Ignition was by chain-driven Runbaken magneto bolted upside-down to the crankcase base, and transmission was by chain up to a counter-shaft carrying a clutch {{and then back to}} the wheel by a second chain. The firm offered a package of <b>wheel,</b> <b>engine</b> unit and front fork or the choice of complete ladies’ or gents’ machines. The complete Cykelaid could be purchased for £50. The specification included an Eadie coaster brake, rear hand-operated brake, number plate, rear stand and Brooks saddle. The wheels were 28″×1.75″, shod with Dunlop Roadster tyres. Alternatively, the complete front fork assembly was available for £32, as a conversion of an existing bicycle. The early versions were not fitted with a front brake and, as mentioned above, the complete machine was fitted with two independent rear brakes. Presumably, when buying the front fork unit to convert an existing bicycle, one was also expected to fit an additional rear brake to the machine. Although the engine was lubricated by the petroil mixture, an additional oil tank was fitted. An oil pump driven by the front wheel hub delivered a measured supply of oil to the engine’s main bearings. It would, therefore, be inadvisable to allow the engine to run for a long period with the clutch disengaged, since this would cut off the supply of oil to the crankshaft. None of the available options proved to be very popular with the buying public.|$|E
