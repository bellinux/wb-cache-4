25|$|Dartford {{was one of}} the {{two most}} {{successful}} clubs in England, its only rival being the London Cricket Club. Dartford's prowess is borne out by a 1723 journal entry recorded by the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford: At Dartford upon the Heath (i.e., Dartford Brent) as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence.|$|E

It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place.|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." [...] He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining [...] "the problem is most of [...] aren't very good." ...|$|E

"My dears," [...] said I, [...] "we {{philosophers}} {{must give}} an occasional {{dip into the}} mystical, and say something apparently absurd {{for the purpose of}} explaining that we mean nothing in particular by it.

500|$|The Get Up Kids {{were viewed}} {{throughout}} their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been {{major players in}} the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s. Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered {{to be one of the}} quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an [...] "emo band." [...] The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album On a Wire, which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that [...] "he punk scene <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now ... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologize." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
2500|$|In Westways Magazine, Smith {{wrote about}} {{driving down the}} Los Angeles River: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the river I saw the Queen Mary. [...] I {{thought that it was}} fitting to have a ship without engines sailing up a river without water." ...|$|E

5000|$|On October 18, 2009, David A. Fernald, the President of New England Air Transport, {{announced}} {{in a press}} release that the airline would be suspending operations, stating that [...] "until <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this current economic downturn {{it is unlikely that}} cash from operations will be sufficient to support continued scheduled flight service". Fernald {{announced in}} the statement that, if able to reorganize, they will continue to provide charter service.|$|R
2500|$|Stoner {{suffered}} a broken right scapula and a fractured left tibia {{as a result}} of the accident. Stoner commented on the crash, [...] "I didn't have enough time to engage the clutch [...] I picked the bike up to try to slow down but I was heading towards the wall so I decided to lay it over and hit the barrier. Unfortunately the barriers were a lot harder than they looked and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it with broken bones." [...] Honda investigated the bike and discovered that the throttle mechanism had been defective and was stuck open at 26 degrees before the crash. Honda officially apologised to Stoner for the mechanical failure.|$|E
2500|$|Christensen {{received}} a Marshall 4x12 G1275 amplifier {{from his parents}} for his 18th birthday, which helped him write heavier music and would shortly thereafter result in the riff to the hit song [...] "Waterline". Their style would frequently be compared to Led Zeppelin and Pearl Jam, even though critics admitted that [...] "the trio wants—and inexplicably even manages—to create their own musical identity." [...] This style would become known as power rock, which the band would later also use to describe their genre and which they were more comfortable with than the label [...] "grunge", explaining: [...] "We are not so wild about the descriptor grunge, as {{it has become a}} predicate for a variety of dimensions. We focus on the music, not the descriptions. What we play is genuine, vivid, and with the energy in high gear." [...] As a reviewer would put it: [...] " [...] 'Grunge light' perhaps - but well-composed, well-acted, engaging and above all different and personal. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had the pedal to the metal, and it did something." [...] Christensen explains: [...] "It's like The Police, who came out of the punk-wave without being punk, and still did well. It's the same with us. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the grunge-wave, without being grunge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has {{been through so much}} she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E

5000|$|No wave music {{presented}} a negative and nihilistic world view {{that reflected the}} desolation of late 1970s downtown New York and how they viewed the larger society. Lydia Lunch noted: [...] "The whole fucking country was nihilistic. What did <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of?</b> The lie of the Summer of Love into Charles Manson and the Vietnam War.
