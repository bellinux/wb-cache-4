5|$|The Montreal Expos hired Virdon {{as their}} manager before the 1983 season, {{replacing}} Jim Fanning, {{and signed a}} two-year contract. During the 1984 season, Virdon expressed his to Expos general manager John McHale {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Expos in 1985. With a 64–67 record in August 1984, the Expos fired Virdon during the 1984 season, replacing him with Fanning. Gary Lucas, a pitcher for the Expos, felt that they had lost many one-run games because Virdon was too conservative in his managing, not employing the hit and run play and relying on the starting pitcher for long in the game.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, {{because there was no}} need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

25|$|The first {{generation}} of Muslim immigrants, who are today mostly retired from the workforce, keep strong ties with their countries, where their families lived. In 1976, the government passed a law allowing families of these immigrants to settle; thus, many children and wives moved to France. Most immigrants, realizing that they couldn't or didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their homeland, asked for French nationality before quietly retiring. However, many live alone in housing projects, having now lost their ties with their countries of origin.|$|E

An offer was allegedly made {{to him that he}} would be left unmolested if he did return, since a son of his was married to a daughter of General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, {{one of the leaders of}} the uprising.

25|$|Superliga relegation battlers Odense Boldklub (OB) honoured the Rangers demand, {{and paid}} £800,000 for Andersen in October 1997. Andersen scored six goals in 16 Superliga games, {{but could not}} prevent Odense from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Andersen moved abroad once more, as OB sold him for DKK 9.6 million to MSV Duisburg in the German Bundesliga in July 1998, to play {{alongside}} fellow Dane Stig Tøfting. Andersen suffered an injury during the pre-season training, and had to undergo a one-and-a-half month recovery. When he recovered he was relegated to a substitute role, and Andersen never found his goal scoring form in Duisburg. Following two goals in 25 games, Andersen was loaned out to Superliga relegation battlers Vejle Boldklub from January to and including June 2000, to play under his former AaB coach Poul Erik Andreasen. Despite seven goals in 14 games from Andersen, Vejle were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. Andersen did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Duisburg, and moved to Odd Grenland in the Norwegian Premier League in July 2000.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that if the sexual {{harassment}} was done by a male, {{both male and female}} victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed students felt physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of students reported having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males. Other effects include getting into trouble at school, changing the route in which one gets to and from school, and stopping doing activities and sports.|$|E
25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

They believe that Scouting in general has moved away from its original intent because of political machinations that happen to longstanding organizations, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the earliest, simplest methods.

[...] Paul Kelly also believed that the NHL's strained relationship with the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia and the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) could affect participation. In a 2009 interview, KHL president Alexander Medvedev claimed that the unwillingness of NHL officials to immediately commit to the Sochi Games was [...] "an instrument of pressure" [...] to force a transfer agreement between the two leagues.|$|E

Brett Berk of Vanity Fair enjoyed the additional depth given to Puck, and he, Stack and New York Rebecca Milzoff commented positively on Puck's budding friendship with Artie. VanDerWerff deemed it the episode's [...] "least objectionable" [...] storyline, though wrote that the awkward inclusion of their duet, the abruptness of Artie's feelings for Brittany, and the [...] "forced nature" [...] of the scene in which Puck confesses {{that he does not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> juvenile detention all [...] "conspired to keep the storyline from lifting off." ...|$|E

This changed after the television series Extra aired a three-part profile on her acting career and work with animals. It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as [...] "an actor's piece", rather than a cameo. Kripke, a fan of The Exorcist, offered to write an episode specifically for her, and she was [...] "really touched" [...] when he listened to her request to leave out demons in the storyline.

500|$|The Heliand, an Old Saxon {{adaptation}} of the New Testament from the 9th century, differs from the New Testament in that an explicit reference is made to a dove sitting {{on the shoulder of}} Christ. Regarding this, G. Ronald Murphy says [...] "In placing the powerful white dove not just above Christ, but right on his shoulder, the Heliand author has portrayed Christ, not only as the Son of the All-Ruler, but also as a new Woden. This deliberate image of Christ triumphantly astride the land with the magnificent bird on his shoulders (the author is perhaps a bit embarrassed that the bird is an unwarlike dove!) is an image intended to calm the fears and longings of those who mourn the loss of Woden and who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the old religion's symbols and ways. With this image, Christ becomes a Germanic god, one into whose ears the Spirit of the Almighty whispers".|$|E
