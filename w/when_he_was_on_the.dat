5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to the bowling crease in England's second innings. He immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. However, Miller did not take a wicket and ended with 0/15 from 14 overs, but again caught Compton. Not {{for the first time}} during the season, the Australian paceman riled the crowd when he launched a series of short-pitched balls at Edrich, apparently in retaliation for the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. The paceman struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop his short-pitched barrage. In another incident, Miller was playing poker with the Englishmen during a rain delay. When the weather cleared, Hassett beckoned him to return to the field for the resumption. Miller ignored him and the poker match continued against the English players who were not currently batting. He won the pot and pocketed the money, before hurriedly running onto the ground late. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field and approaching the centre, Miller pulled the money out of his pockets. He brandished the notes to the crowd and taunted his English colleagues. The match ended in a draw after the entire fourth day and half of the fifth day was washed out. England declared upon the resumption of play on the final day and set Australia a target of 317 for victory. The tourists reached 1/92 to ensure a draw.|$|E
25|$|While at Anderlecht, Olsen {{became the}} seventh Dane to play 50 {{games for the}} {{national}} team, in June 1981. For Olsen's 53rd national team game in April 1983, the German national team manager of Denmark, Sepp Piontek, named Olsen permanent national team captain, as Olsen replaced the retiring Per Røntved as both libero and team captain. Olsen played as an attacking libero, and had defensive midfielder Jens Jørn Bertelsen cover for him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attack. Olsen, alongside defender Søren Busk, persuaded Piontek to implement the aggressive off-side trap they practiced at Anderlecht.|$|E

25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the burial ground is the grave of Captain James Kelly, an old Fenian who was associated with the Fenian Rising of 1867. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as The Knight of Glendoo. On one occasion <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in Wicklow Street when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.|$|E
25|$|From {{that point}} on {{he took over the}} story. He told us that {{in the early part of}} his career he had taken special {{training}} on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons he felt a little safer <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
25|$|England {{was under}} the firmest control of all the lands in the Angevin Empire, due {{to the age of}} many of the offices that governed the country and the traditions and customs that were in place. England was divided in shires with sheriffs in each {{enforcing}} the common law. A justiciar was appointed by the king to stand in his absence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> continent. As the kings of England were more often in France than England they used writs more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, which actually proved beneficial to England. Under William I's rule, Anglo-Saxon nobles had been largely replaced by Anglo-Norman ones who couldn't own large expanses of contiguous lands, because their lands were split between England and France. This made it much harder for them to revolt against the king and defend all of their lands at once. Earls held a status {{similar to that of the}} continental counts, but there were no dukes at this time, only ducal titles that the kings of England held.|$|E

25|$|In March 2007, Herbalife {{signed a}} five-year {{deal with the}} Galaxy, worth between $4–5million a year, to be the club's primary shirt sponsor. Four months later, the club signed David Beckham from Real Madrid. His debut was made at Home Depot Center before a record crowd of nearly 35,000, {{including}} many celebrities, coming on in the 78th minute in a 1–0 loss to Chelsea in a match during the World Series of Football tournament. The match brought unprecedented TV coverage from ESPN, who used 19 cameras to cover it, including one trained only on Beckham, even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench. In that season's SuperLiga, LA reached the final but lost to Mexican side Pachuca on penalties after extra time. LA nearly made the end-of-season play-offs, but were eliminated following a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. In the off-season, Cobi Jones retired and, amidst rumors {{that he was going}} to be sacked, Yallop resigned as head coach following a friendly match at Home Depot Center. The San Jose Earthquakes bought out his contract and offered a third round draft pick to the Galaxy as compensation to hire Yallop as their new head coach. Yallop was replaced at LA by Ruud Gullit, who signed a three-year contract with the club, making him the highest paid coach in MLS history. Cobi Jones returned as assistant coach. LA went on a promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand, setting attendance records in both countries. 80,295 people showed up at Stadium Australia for the match between Sydney FC and LA Galaxy, which the home side won 5–3. They also played a tour of Asia, and competed in the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Honolulu, finishing third after beating Sydney 2–1 in the third-place match.|$|E

500|$|On Opening Day (April 5) 2012, Torres re-injured {{his left}} calf—which he had {{previously}} hurt during 2012 spring training—and spent much of April on the disabled list. He was activated on April 30. However, though he would receive most of the starts in center field, he began to platoon with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, who had filled in for him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disabled list. This continued until July 29, when Nieuwenhuis was returned to the minor leagues, enabling Torres to be the full-time starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Torres endured a career-worst 0 for 18 streak that he finally snapped with a hit against Rafael Betancourt on August 20 in a 31 loss to the Colorado Rockies. In 132 games (374 at bats), he hit [...]230 with 86 hits, 17 doubles, seven triples, three home runs, 35 RBI, and 13 stolen bases (in 18 attempts). As a right-handed hitter, he batted [...]286. He joined José Reyes as the only players in Mets' history to have two games in a season with a triple and home run. Following the season, he filed for free agency.|$|E

500|$|Noriega's {{relationship}} with the U.S. intelligence services was regularized during the 1970s, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> CIA payroll; the CIA made its first regular payment to him in 1971. Previously he had been paid on a case-by-case basis. The CIA had valued him as an asset since the 1970s because {{he was willing to}} provide information about the Cuban government, and later about the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. On some occasions, the Panamanian embassy in Managua would be used by U.S. intelligence agents. Noriega was given access to CIA contingency funds, which he was supposed to use to improve his intelligence programs, but which he could spend with little accountability. The payments were as high as U.S. $100,000 in some years. However, the CIA was aware that Noriega was selling intelligence on the U.S. to Cuba at the same time. During negotiations for the Panama Canal treaties, the U.S. government ordered its military intelligence to wiretap Panamanian officials. Noriega discovered this operation in early 1976, and instead of making it public, bribed the U.S. agents and bought the tapes himself; the incident {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Singing Sergeants affiar". Although some intelligence officials wanted Bush to prosecute the soldiers involved, he declined to do so, because that would have exposed Noriega's role in the matter. The CIA did not report this incident to either the National Security Agency or the U.S. Justice Department. Noriega and Torrijos later used their knowledge of the U.S. wiretapping operations to tilt the Panama Canal negotiations in their favor.|$|E

Dunning's wife died in 1863 and Dunning remarried to the widow of Allen Ashford on September 17, 1865. When his term in the Senate ended in 1867, he was nominated to run again, but declined. He declined a second offer to run for Congress in 1868, preferring to remain in his law practice. Dunning gained a national reputation as a lawyer, and was committed to criminal law.

2500|$|In {{the midst}} of Lanfranc's {{scholastic}} and controversial activities Lanfranc became a political force. Later tradition told {{that while he was}} Prior of Bec he opposed the non-canonical marriage of Duke William with Matilda of Flanders (1053) and carried matters so far that he incurred a sentence of exile. But the quarrel was settled <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point of departure, and he undertook the difficult task of obtaining the pope’s approval of the marriage. In this he was successful at the same council which witnessed his third victory over Berengar (1059), and he thus acquired a lasting claim on William's gratitude. In assessing this story it may well be relevant that no reputable source can tell what the exact impediment to marriage was. In 1066 Lanfranc became the first Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Étienne at [...] Caen in Normandy, a monastery dedicated to Saint Stephen which the duke had supposedly been enjoined to found as a penance for his disobedience to the Holy See.|$|E

2500|$|Although of a {{slightly}} short and medium build (1.73 m/5ft 8"), Laver developed a technically complete serve-and-volley game, with aggressive groundstrokes {{to back it}} up. Dan Maskell, the Voice of Wimbledon, [...] described him as [...] "technically faultless." [...] His left-handed serve was well disguised and wide swinging. His groundstrokes on both flanks were hit with topspin, as was the attacking topspin lob, which Laver developed into a weapon. His stroke technique was based on quick shoulder turns, true swings, and accurate timing. His backhand, often hit on the run, was a point-ender that gave him an advantage. Laver was very quick and had a strong left forearm. Rex Bellamy wrote, [...] "The strength of that wrist and forearm gave him blazing power without loss of control, even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run and at full stretch. The combination of speed and strength, especially wrist strength, enabled him to hit ferocious winners when way out of court." [...] At the net, he had forcing volleys, often hit as stroke volleys. Especially on the backhand, he could hit sharp underspin angles as well. [...] He was difficult to lob, because of his springing agility, and when forced to retreat, he {{could come up with}} a vicious counterpunch.|$|E

[...] When Wu's forces arrived at Shouyang in fall 573, Wu put Shouyang under siege, quickly capturing the outer city and forcing Northern Qi forces to withdraw into the inner city. [...] Gao Wei sent the general Pi Jinghe (皮景和) to try to lift the siege on Shouyang, but once Pi reached Shouyang's vicinity, he did not dare to engage Wu, and Wu intensified his siege, capturing Shouyang in winter 573.

Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer." [...] The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics {{accused him of being}} a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.|$|E
