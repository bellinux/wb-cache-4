500|$|While Goldstone {{was still}} a child, his {{grandfather}} encouraged him to study law. He later recalled: [...] "My grandfather decided <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> four [...] I {{was going to be}} a barrister, so I just always assumed I was. It turned out to be a wise decision." [...] Goldstone was educated at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and subsequently undertook a six-year legal studies course at the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he graduated in 1962 with a BA LLB cum laude.|$|E
500|$|Clem Burke of Blondie {{has said}} [...] "Early on all I cared about was Keith Moon and the Who. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> eleven or twelve, my {{favourite}} part of drum lessons {{was the last}} ten minutes, when I'd get {{to sit at the}} drumset and play along to my favourite record. I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. 'My Generation' was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} {{his interest in}} World War II themes with the films 1941, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, and the Indiana Jones series. Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{they were}} Methodists, Sheldrake's parents {{sent him to}} Worksop College, a Church of England {{boarding}} school. Sheldrake says,I went through the standard scientific atheist phase <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 14 ... I bought into that package deal of science equals atheism. I was the only boy at my high Anglican boarding school who refused to get confirmed.

2500|$|The name of Florence and the Machine is {{attributed}} to Florence Welch's teenage collaboration with Isabella [...] "Machine" [...] Summers. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, [...] "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Kullervo from Finnish mythology {{contains}} elements similar to Elric's story, {{such as a}} talking magic sword and fatal alienation of the hero from his family. [...] Besides Elric, Kullervo has been proposed as having influence on Poul Anderson's 1954 novel The Broken Sword, and J.R.R. Tolkien's Túrin Turambar. [...] Moorcock has stated that [...] "Anderson's a definite influence , as stated. But oddly, the Kalevala was read to us at my boarding school <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> seven", and [...] "from {{a very early age}} I was reading Norse legends and any books I could find about Norse stories". [...] Moorcock in the same posting stated [...] "one thing I'm pretty sure of, I was not in any way directly influenced by Prof. T".|$|E
2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{well as to}} nature, {{the lyrics}} make many {{references}} to Davies' own city childhood; [...] "The real village green {{is a combination of}} north London places: the little green near my childhood home in Fortis Green... That little green is where we played football, and where we stayed ’til it was dark. There was mystery there... The record’s about lost childhood, but also being a kid." [...] Similarly [...] "Do You Remember Walter?" [...] is based upon a real-life childhood friend, [...] "Sitting By The Riverside" [...] recalls how Davies [...] "went fishing a lot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> eight", the eventual title track, one of the last written and recorded (in August 1968), is full of references to children's entertainments of his youth; comic-strips, cinema, radio and theatre, and two lyrics, [...] "Phenomenal Cat" [...] and [...] "Wicked Annabella", resemble children's fantasy literature.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing {{really sort of}} seriously <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> eleven. I say seriously {{in the sense that}} like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, I used to go home from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E
2500|$|While writing Women in Love in Cornwall during 1916–17, Lawrence {{developed}} {{a strong and}} possibly romantic relationship with a Cornish farmer named William Henry Hocking. Although {{it is not clear}} if their relationship was sexual, Frieda said she believed it was. Lawrence's fascination with the theme of homosexuality, which is overtly manifested in Women in Love, could be related to his own sexual orientation. In a letter written during 1913, he writes, [...] "I should like to know why nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality, whether he admits it or not ..." [...] He is also quoted as saying, [...] "I believe the nearest I've come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 16." [...] However, given his enduring and robust relationship with Frieda it is likely that he was primarily [...] "bi-curious" [...] in the terminology of today, and whether he actually ever had homosexual relations remains an open question.|$|E
5000|$|Emperor Wenxuan (r. 550-559) of the Northern Qi dynasty was {{an early}} skeptic about {{immortality}} elixirs. He ordered alchemists to make the jiuhuan jindan 九還金丹 (Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir), which he kept in a jade box, and explained, [...] "I am still too fond of {{the pleasures of the}} world to take flight to the heavens immediately—I intend to consume the elixir only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>about</b> to die."

2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City. The Stacks were active in their community, as their apartment was a hospitable place that was likened to [...] "a stop for tenants and neighborhood people seeking assistance or advice." [...] It was with his parents that Stack first began {{to participate in the}} practice of providing turkeys and holiday gifts to the needy, a practice that Stack would later institute as Mayor As Stack explained to a reporter when he was 19, [...] "I remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 6 or 7 years old being at the Doric Temple polling place on election day just sitting and listening to the local politicians. I would probably say I dedicated my high school years to politics when I guess I should have been more into school activities. My classmates would call me 'mayor'. But I always believed it's vitally important for young people to get involved. We are the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Wilson explained: [...] "I first felt I {{had a good}} voice <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> {{seventeen}} or {{eighteen and}} was able to sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake." [...] For a period, Wilson avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, [...] "I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'" ...|$|E
