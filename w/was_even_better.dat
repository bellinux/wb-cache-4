5|$|Cleveland's success drew {{large crowds}} {{both at home}} and away in 1947. The team's average home {{attendance}} was 55,848 people during the season, slightly lower than in 1946 but still the best in either the AAFC or NFL. Including away games, a total of 666,017 people saw the Browns play, a professional football record. Although the team was a major success on the field, the following season <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> for Cleveland. The team won all of its games in 1948 and a third straight AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Living Proof was mixed. Some music critics {{noted that}} it <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than Believe, while others criticized the excessive use of Auto-Tune. Commercially, the album did not reach the same success as its predecessor, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 82,000 copies. It was also received moderately in Europe, peaking within the top 30 in Sweden and the top 50 in the United Kingdom, despite being certified gold by both Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Living Proof is estimated to have sold {{more than a million}} copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Toy Story's first sequel Toy Story 2 was {{released}} in theatres November 24, 1999 and saw {{the return of the}} majority of the voice cast from Toy Story, and the film focuses on Buzz leading Andy's toys on a mission to rescue Woody after he is stolen by a greedy toy collector voiced by Wayne Knight. The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought it <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews. At Metacritic, the film earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews. The film's widest release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $485,015,179 worldwide, becoming the second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its release.|$|E

25|$|Wen Renmin (聞人敏), a {{man from}} the same {{hometown}} as Lu Mao, once visited the Wu capital. He received a grand reception that <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than that normally received by nobles. Lu Mao thought that this was inappropriate according to Confucian rules of propriety because he believed the level of the reception should be based on the person's social status. He was proven right later. He died in 239.|$|E

After his performance dipped down in 2004, Gordon decided to leave and start his own team, the No. 7 with Robby Gordon Motorsports, and Jeff Burton was tabbed as his replacement.|$|E

25|$|The only {{currency}} {{strong enough}} to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. economy, the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold ($35 an ounce), and {{the commitment of the}} U.S. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. In fact, the dollar <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than gold: it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1945, {{when the}} war ended, Lt. Williams was sent to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. While in Pearl Harbor, Williams played {{baseball}} in the Army League. Also in that eight-team league were Joe DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, and Stan Musial. The Service World Series with the Army versus the Navy attracted crowds of 40,000 for each game. The players said it <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than the actual World Series being played between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs that year.|$|E
25|$|Lowson {{was born}} in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. A {{right-handed}} opening batsman from the Bradford League, Lowson came late to first-class cricket and then was an instant success as an opening batsman for Yorkshire, scoring 1,799 runs in his first season, 1949, and partnering Len Hutton in the most prolific season of Hutton's career. The following year, 1950, Lowson <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better,</b> scoring 2,152 runs and {{during the first half}} of the 1950s he continued a hugely productive partnership with Hutton, often being described as a Hutton clone.|$|E

He was only once off {{the front row of}} the grid, and had five pole positions, as well as four fastest laps. From {{thirteen}} rounds, he was on the rostrum for twelve, and finished sixth in the other. He came second five times, and was a winner in Australia, Malaysia, and three European venues. His 225 points, 200 of them counted, were enough to help him move up to the 250cc class.|$|E
25|$|Lodge’s gifts as an expounder of {{knowledge}} {{were of a}} high order, and few scientific men {{have been able to}} set forth abstruse facts in a more lucid or engaging form… Those who heard him on a great occasion, as when he gave his Romanes lecture at Oxford or his British Association presidential address at Birmingham, were charmed by his alluring personality as well as impressed by the orderly development of his thesis. But he <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> in informal debate, and when he rose, the audience, however perplexed or jaded, settled down in a pleased expectation that was never disappointed.|$|E
25|$|During the 1977–78 season, George Gervin and David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets battled {{all season}} for the NBA scoring title. On {{the final day of}} the season, Thompson took the lead by scoring 73 points in an {{afternoon}} game against the Detroit Pistons. That night Gervin knew that he needed 58 points against the Jazz in New Orleans. Gervin got off to a good start by scoring 20 points in the 1st quarter. In the 2nd, The Iceman <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better,</b> setting a single period record with 33 points. Early on in the 3rd period Gervin scored his 58 points on the way to 63 capturing the scoring title. While Gervin was lighting up the scoreboard the Spurs were winning the Central Division with a 52–30 record.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the year, though, Evernham made a change. He signed Jeremy Mayfield, who had {{recorded}} three wins for Penske Racing but who had been fired in September 2001 and had not run since, to join Elliott and drive the No. 19. As part of the move, Evernham agreed to the aforementioned deal with Ultra Motorsports which gave Atwood a car to drive. Mayfield struggled in his initial year with Evernham, posting just four top tens and finishing 26th in points. He won a pole at Talladega Superspeedway the next year however, and improved to 19th in points. 2004 <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better,</b> winning at Richmond and barely making the cut for the inaugural Chase for the Nextel Cup. He claimed one more win in 2005 and qualified once again for the Chase.|$|E
25|$|A son of Essex's first regular wicket-keeper and {{a cousin}} of Kent bowler Tich Freeman, Russell first played for Essex in 1908 but did not {{establish}} himself until 1913. In that year he reached 1,000 runs and repeated this {{for the next three}} years, but it was only a knock of 197 against Middlesex at Lord's in 1920 that elevated Russell to the rank of a top-class batsman. His 2,432 runs was third-highest in the country behind Hobbs and Hendren and he was an automatic choice for that winter's Ashes tour. Though the failure of England's professional bowling on the rock-hard Australian wickets meant England lost all five Tests, Russell did well with an average of 58.42 for all matches, including 135 at Adelaide. His batting the following year <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> than in 1920, scoring two centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid change}} of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX, King of France, who succeeded his brother {{after a very}} short time, <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> {{inclined}} to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him diverse abbacies and priories; and he called him and regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard {{on the part of}} the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle's Cleopatre) to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bartas as his rival.|$|E

25|$|The 2002 Buccaneers {{defense is}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). Derrick Brooks was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12–4 regular season. The team <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined – all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes – returning 4 for touchdowns – and collected 11 sacks.|$|E
25|$|As expected, {{the first}} three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring {{contests}} featuring stellar goaltending {{at both ends of}} the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was just a little bit better than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better</b> in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.|$|E
25|$|After {{the chain}} of {{disasters}} {{in the summer of}} 1944, the Allies expected the Wehrmacht to be unable to recover, but the opposite was true. Although manpower losses were enormous, the Wehrmacht compensated this with transferring of men from the Reserve Army, the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine into frontline troops for rebuilding their forces. Regarding industrial production the situation <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>better.</b> Despite the increasing Allied bombing campaign and the loss of territories and factories, Germany reached its peak of wartime production in the autumn of 1944, after the reforms of Albert Speer and the increased use of forced labour. For the preparing of the Ardennes Offensive, the 5th Panzer Army was pulled out of the front and replaced by the 15th Army, although for deception purposes its name was changed to conceal this fact. The Allies therefore faced two armies: the 15th Army in the Hürtgen Forest; and the 7th Army in the north in the Rur plains. Although nominally an equal force to the Allies on paper, the Germans were heavily outnumbered. In some sectors the ratio of attacker to defender was about 5 to 1. The reason for this was the acute manpower shortage that the Germans were experiencing. Most of the German units were seriously understrength, with some divisions consisting of only a few thousand men. However, heavy entrenchment and the availability of considerable tank and artillery support went some way to compensate for those problems. The German troops were commanded by OB West Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt and commander of Army Group B Generalfeldmarshall Walther Model, with the latter considered a skilled defense specialist.|$|E
