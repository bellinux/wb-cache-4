5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume <b>workpieces.</b> Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume <b>workpieces,</b> because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical <b>workpieces</b> include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel <b>workpieces</b> with carbon steel <b>workpieces.</b>|$|E

40|$|The cutting {{mechanism}} and residual stress {{profile of the}} micro-cutting thin <b>workpiece</b> {{are affected by the}} interaction of the thin <b>workpiece</b> and the fixture (substrate) underneath it similar to that observed in the nano-indentation and nano-scratching of thin film. The appropriate substrate properties are necessary especially to avoid detachment during machining and to minimize deformation and warping of the machined thin <b>workpiece.</b> Thus, the investigations of the influence of substrate properties on micro-cutting thin <b>workpiece</b> are essentially to be conducted. The finite element study of orthogonal micro-cutting of thin Al 6061 -T 6 is presented here. The simulations were conducted to study the residual stress profile across the thickness of the machined thin <b>workpiece</b> at various <b>workpiece</b> thicknesses and various substrate (adhesive) elastic properties. Simulations results show that as the machined <b>workpiece</b> become thinner, the stress is more significant not only on the machined surface but also it can reach the bottom of the <b>workpiece.</b> The stiffer substrate produces less variation of the stress across the <b>workpiece</b> thickness while more compliant substrate produces broader stress variation as the <b>workpiece</b> become thinner. The results show the significant effect of the <b>workpiece</b> thickness and the substrate properties on the stress profiles in the micro-cutting of thin <b>workpiece...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin <b>workpieces.</b> The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin <b>workpieces,</b> as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the <b>workpieces</b> are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the <b>workpieces</b> should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper puts forward an {{intelligent}} single-plane biaxial balance monitor system, {{which is used}} in ultra-precision grinding.

For ultra-precision grinding, caused by the mutual influence of the vibration of wheel and <b>workpiece,</b> there will be a ripple on the <b>workpiece</b> surface, which is mainly influenced by the frequency ratio of wheel to <b>workpiece,</b> the feed rate and the vibration of wheel and <b>workpiece.</b> This system can improve the machining accuracy, reduce the surface error of <b>workpiece</b> and appraise the integrated machining result, by analyzing the vibration data of wheel and <b>workpiece</b> and adjusting machining parameters...|$|R
50|$|Metal forming {{operations}} {{result in}} situations exposing the metal <b>workpiece</b> to stresses of reversed sign. The Bauschinger effect contributes to work softening of the <b>workpiece,</b> {{for example in}} straightening of drawn bars or rolled sheets, where rollers subject the <b>workpiece</b> to alternate bending stresses, thereby reducing the yield strength and enabling greater cold drawability of the <b>workpiece.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>workpiece</b> {{is fixed}} between the {{headstock}} and the tail-stock, {{it is said}} to be [...] "between centers".

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and <b>workpieces</b> must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching <b>workpieces</b> {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel <b>workpieces.</b> In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn-line {{estimation}} of <b>workpiece</b> height {{is essential for}} wire breaking prevention in WEDM process. In addition, it can provide the reference of machining parameters setting for increasing machining speed and stability. A new on-line WEDM <b>workpiece</b> height estimation system for the iso-energy type wire EDM machine is presented. Based on the proposed specific discharge energy (SDE), a mathematical model relating <b>workpiece</b> height, feed rate and discharging frequency by a proportional constant is derived. This constant coined thickness identification coefficient (TIC) is found a function of <b>workpiece</b> height. Hence, a simplified approach is proposed. The value of TIC of a known <b>workpiece</b> height is taken to estimate the <b>workpiece</b> height during the WEDM process. The actual <b>workpiece</b> height is obtained by multiplying the estimated value by the correction factor of the associated <b>workpiece</b> height.

In the practical application of machining a <b>workpiece</b> with dynamic variations in thickness, a model relating optimum servo voltage and <b>workpiece</b> height that leads to maximum machining speed is established in advance. The servo voltage is adjusted according to the estimated height. It is found that the process can be maintained very stable at maximum machining speed without wire breaking...|$|R

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the <b>workpieces</b> and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker <b>workpieces,</b> and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on <b>workpieces</b> of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E

5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin <b>workpieces,</b> especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

40|$|Based on the Coulomb {{friction}} model, the frictional motion {{model of}} <b>workpiece</b> {{relating to the}} polishing pad was presented in annular polishing. By the dynamic analysis software, the model was simulated and analysed. The conclusions from the results were that the <b>workpiece</b> did not rotate steadily. When the angular velocity of ring and the direction {{were the same as}} that of the polishing pad, the angular velocity of <b>workpiece</b> hoicked at the beginning and at the later stage were {{the same as that of}} the polishing pad before contacting with the ring. The angular velocity of <b>workpiece</b> vibrated at the moment of contacting with the ring. After that the angular velocity of <b>workpiece</b> increased gradually and fluctuated at a given value, while the angular velocity of ring decreased gradually and also fluctuated at a given value. Since the contact between the <b>workpiece</b> and the ring was linear, their linear velocities and directions should be the same. But the angular velocity of <b>workpiece</b> was larger than that of the polishing pad on the condition that the radius of the <b>workpiece</b> was less than that of the ring. This did not agree with the pure translation principle and the <b>workpiece</b> surface could not be flat, either. Consequently, it needed to be controlled with the angular velocity of ring and the radii of the ring and the <b>workpiece,</b> besides friction to make the angular velocity of <b>workpiece</b> equal to that of the polishing pad for obtaining fine surface flatness of the <b>workpiece.</b> Copyright © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. ...|$|R
