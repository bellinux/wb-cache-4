40|$|Nearly 700, 000 people {{suffered}} from stroke {{last year and}} those who survived were left with any number of disabilities. One {{of the most common}} disabilities in stroke is paralysis of the upper arm. Since therapy for this disability is expensive, patients are finding rehabilitation difficult to afford and manage. This thesis proposes an inexpensive pneumatic <b>wearable</b> <b>garment</b> for the patient to use for stroke rehabilitation. Unlike most rehabilitation robots, which are large, non-compliant, and expensive, this device will enable the patient to purchase the garment and move freely within their own home while rehabilitating their affected arm. In this thesis, a wearable elbow device similar to the proposed <b>wearable</b> <b>garment</b> was designed using an inexpensive elbow brace. The elbow brace used custom made artificial air muscles also known as McKibben Artificial Muscles to substitute for the biceps and triceps, which are responsible for flexion and extension of the human elbow. These artificial muscles were chosen for their low-cost, compliance, lightweight, and large force capabilities. The air muscles were designed and developed especially for this device and cost less than $ 3. 00 to make and weigh approximately 11 g. This pneumatically actuated elbow brace was controlled using solenoid valves in conjunction with a Mitsubishi M 32 / 83 C 16 -bit micro controller to achieve flexion and extension of the elbow. Experiments on the pneumatic elbow brace have shown that it is capable of moving a passive patient’s arm within a 110 º range, which is adequate for rehabilitation of the elbow.

Application of pressure makes the layers of conductive yarn to come in contact, resulting in a short circuit, which may be recorded using multi-meters. Removing the pressure cause the connection points to separate away and it depends on the weave design.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The primary {{objective}} of body armor {{research is the}} development of low-cost, lightweight, <b>wearable</b> <b>garments</b> that effectively resist ballistic impact. This study introduces a material intended to reduce nonpenetration trauma by absorbing energy from ballistic impacts. Layers of web were made by low-melting point polyester (LMPET) on unaligned fibers of high-strength polyamide 6 (HSPA 6). A compound nonwoven fab-ric was made by laying high-strength Vectran filaments between two layers of HSPA 6 -LMPET web. The new fabric underwent needle punching and thermal bonding to form a composite sandwich structure. The new fabric was subjected to a falling weight impact test and a ballistic impact test. The results indicated that the material with the new design reduced maximum indentation depth by 8 %. Furthermore, soft body armor made from the material with the new design would cost less to produce and would weigh 22. 5 % less than conventional soft body armor...|$|R

The approach that was adopted for this project is a recently developed method on Material Driven Design (MDD), which suggests a number of steps to design meaningful products when a chosen material {{is the point of}} departure. As this method has not yet been applied on a project involving additive manufacturing, another goal is to explore how the MDD method {{can be used in a}} project where AM is the primary production method. For MDD, this means that the material that is usually the starting point, should now be a combination of material, structure and process (MSP), and that it is important to understand how these aspects influence each other. The final MSP concept can be locally varied to create property gradients, which results in a range of slightly different MSP’s. These materials have been embodied in the design of a corselet, which utilizes the different properties of the MSP.

However, MCP design challenges related to pressure uniformity, pressure magnitude, and donning/doffing remain unsolved [2]. Previous MCP efforts have focused on passive compression technologies, but an ideal MCP garment would incorporate actively controllable elements designed to dynamically change the garment’s shape, which would enable real-time and high-resolution modification of compression profiles {{to address these issues}} [3].

Generally characterized as a garment with notched collar and lapels and a lining, these “tailored” garments are expected to fit appropriately and be constructed to a high level of quality. Classic tailoring, also known as bespoke tailoring in the UK, refers to the methods and techniques used to build a completely original and unique suit for your client. For this project, each of my clients are members of my family: my younger cousin, myself, my mother, and my grandmother.

It joins references to clothing as our 'home' (what we live in) with ancient hand weaving techniques in an experimental three-dimensional manner to explore ecological concepts. The piece is presented as an installation, in which thread exists both as woven cloth, and in copious quantities in its non-woven state. I used traditional hand-woven tapestry techniques (French Gebelin technique) to construct – and I then deconstructed – a child's dress, to examine the flow variants of water around our planet. The work uses the everyday object of clothing {{as a vehicle to}} explore and present concepts relating to ecology and hydro-sustainability. The dress is a facsimile, not an actually <b>wearable</b> <b>garment,</b> and the cloth is custom hand-woven, in contrast to the 'meterage' of cloth woven industrially: the notion of 'made by our own hands' is central to the work's concept, reflecting the perception that ecological problems such as global warming are constructed by human beings.

This work involves a synthesis of traditional and new textile processes presented in a fine art context.

40|$|The sensors {{commonly}} used today to measure human physiological parameters are hard and discrete and {{not suitable for}} long term monitoring. A <b>wearable</b> <b>garment</b> with integrated fabric sensors incorporated in an unobtrusive way is highly desirable for long term physiological monitoring, particularly in a non-clinical environment. The aim of this work is to investigate fabric sensors which can be integrated into a garment to allow the unobtrusive monitoring of physiological parameters, primarily for measuring the electrocardiograph (ECG) and respiration. The work focuses on using only dry fabric electrodes where skin preparation {{and the use of}} chemical gels or adhesives are not employed. The textile structure used in {{this study was designed to}} provide controlled contact pressure, enable construction using common textile processing methods, allow accurate placement of electrodes on the body, allow comfortable fit and be unobtrusive to wear. It was decided to use the knitting method to make bands which incorporated conductive electrodes in order to evaluate different fabric electrodes materials. The detection of respiration using fabric strain sensors did not require electrical contact with the skin. Preliminary experiments were conducted on a single subject to develop a device and methodology. Galvanic skin response and ECG was initially investigated to determine the effectiveness of electrode materials. ECG was established as a more reliable measure and was subsequently used to evaluate the initial performance of the fabric electrodes, and further refine the test methodology on a single subject. Experiments were then conducted on 10 male volunteer participants of reasonable general health having no known heart conditions, with ages 30 - 55 and BMI 20 - 30. It was found that fabric sensors which were soft, pliable and flexible have advantages in terms of ability to provide better quality ECG signals and a comfortable bio-interface. Variation in the pressure applied to the electrode directly affects the acquired signal level and a pressure of 2. 5 KPa is preferred. Multifilament conductive yarns are more easily processed into fabric than monofilament yarns and are generally preferred. Electrodes comprising a conductive polymer treated fabric gave better performance than metal or metal coated yarns. Fabric strain sensors were tested and used to detect respiration on a single subject. It was found that human respiration can be measured using strain sensors such as those comprised of a conductive polymer treated fabric or a fabric incorporating a rigid conductive monofilament fibre...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the use of textile structures as muscles to assist people with muscular deficiency or paralysis. Due to the average life expectancy continuing to increase, support for those needing assistance to move unaided is also increasing. The purpose of this project was to try to help a patient who would normally need assistance, to move their arm unaided. It could also help with rehabilitation of muscular injuries and increasing strength and reducing muscular fatigue of manual workers. The approach considered was to develop an extra corporal device for the upper limbs, providing the main required motions. Most devices currently available use motors and gearboxes to assist in limb movement. This study investigated a way of mimicking the contraction of biological skeletal muscles to create a motion that is as human as possible with a soft, flexible and lightweight construction. Electroactive polymers (EAPs) and pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) were investigated. It became clear that at present, the EAPs were unable to create the forces and speed of contraction required for this application. The use of pneumatics to create artificial muscles was developed upon. PAMs, like the McKibben muscle and the pleated pneumatic muscle mimic the natural contraction of skeletal muscle. These current PAMs were used as a basis to develop a new type of pneumatic artificial muscle in this project. A 90 mm ball-like structure was developed, produced from an air impermeable rubber coated cotton fabric. Joining three oval panels together created a 3 -D spherical shape. Three of these structures were linked together, and when inflated, created an acceptable level of contraction and force. This method of producing artificial muscles created a soft, lightweight and flexible actuator with scope for different arrangements, sizes and positions of the muscle structure. The contraction process was mathematically modelled. This calculated the predicted rate and level of contraction of a 2 -D muscle structure. These mathematical findings were able to be compared to the practical results, and produced similar contraction characteristics. The muscle structures were incorporated into a garment to form a type of muscle suit which could be worn to assist movement. This garment has an aluminium frame to protect the wearer's bones from stresses from the contracting muscles. This study has shown that the muscle suit developed can create movement for wearers that would normally need assistance, and also reduce muscle fatigue, which would be useful for manual workers. This is incorporated into a functional and <b>wearable</b> <b>garment,</b> which is easy to dress and more lightweight and aesthetically pleasing than current muscle suits.

30|$|AQUA TITAN-treated {{material}} {{is shown to}} exert effects on physiology even when not {{in direct contact with}} nerves, this is supported by several lines of evidence in cells cultured in plates above pico- to micrometer thickness of titanium: with evidence of enhanced osteoblast differentiation (Sugita et al. 2011), migration, proliferation, and differentiation of myoblasts (Ishizaki et al. 2011) and altered neuronal firing rate (Korte 2008). That the effects of titanium are inhibited when cells are shielded with aluminium wrapping and lead plates in both animal and culture studies (Aoi et al. 2009; Korte 2008), indicates that the influence of AQUA TITAN on neurons seems to be mediated via some factor that can cross open space but does not penetrate other metals, such as electromagnetic waves.

Moderate- to high- pooled effect sizes (Unbiased (Hedges' g) standardized mean differences (SMD) = 0. 31 - 0. 66) were observed with the addition of noise in a Stochastic Resonance Stimulation Strategy (SRSS), in three populations (i. e., healthy young adults, older adults, and individuals with lower-limb injuries), and under different task constraints (i. e., unipedal, bipedal, and eyes open). A Textured Material Stimulation Strategy (TMSS) enhanced postural control in the most challenging condition-eyes-closed on a stable surface (SMD = 0. 61), and in older adults (SMD = 0. 30). The <b>Wearable</b> <b>Garments</b> Stimulation Strategy (WGSS) showed no or adverse effects (SMD = - 0. 68 - 0. 05) under all task constraints and in all populations, except in individuals with lower-limb injuries (SMD = 0. 20). Results of our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that future research could consider combining two or more stimulation strategies in intervention treatments for postural regulation and balance problems, depending on individual needs...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a dynamic}} {{measurement}} system (DMS) is presented for assessing performance of wearable and dry bio-potential surface electrodes (DBSEs) in air, especially motion artifacts. A pair of perforated membranes is assembled {{on the two}} ends of the barrel which contains electrolyte to simulate surface of the skin. The pressure of electrode/membrane can be controlled and measured, one of electrodes can move on membrane by the motion controller. Experimental results show maximum coefficient of variation (CV) of electrical impedance spectra (EIS) and dynamic open circuit potential variation (DOCP, so-called motion artifacts) of gold electrode pair are, respectively, 4. 3 % and 7. 2 % in continuous measurements, 12. 6 % and 22 % in discontinuous measurements, the pressure {{and the length of}} motion track between electrode and membrane are strongly linear correlation with DOCP variations. EIS and DOCP of five types of electrodes were measured on DMS and their parameters of equivalent circuit (EC) of EIS and DOCP variation show larger is equivalent capacitance in electrode/electrolyte interface, less is DOCP variation. DOCP variations of two batches of electrode performed respectively on DMS and on skin have approximate 0. 64 of Pearson correlation coefficient. In general, the DMS provides a powerful tool to investigate the mechanism of DOCP variation and evaluates the static or dynamic performance of electrodes. However, parameters of EC model by fitting EIS can predict the motion artifact and help the design of electrode and its integrated <b>wearable</b> <b>garments.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{commercialization of}} smart <b>wearable</b> <b>garments</b> is hindered {{by the lack}} of fully integrated carbon-based energy storage devices into smart wearables. Since electrodes are the active components that determine the performance of energy storage systems, it is important to rationally design and engineer hierarchical architectures atboth the nano- and macroscale that can enjoy all of the necessary requirements for a perfect electrode. Here we demonstrate a large-scale flexible fabrication of highly porous high-performance multifunctional graphene oxide (GO) and rGO fibers and yarns by taking advantage of the intrinsic soft self-assembly behavior of ultralarge graphene oxide liquid crystalline dispersions. The produced yarns, which are the only practical form of these architectures for real-life device applications, were found to be mechanically robust (Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus in excess of 29 GPa) and exhibited high native electrical conductivity (2508 ± 632 S m(- 1)) and exceptionally high specific surface area (2605 m(2) g(- 1) before reduction and 2210 m(2) g(- 1) after reduction). Furthermore, the highly porous nature of these architectures enabled us to translate the superior electrochemical properties of individual graphene sheets into practical everyday use devices with complex geometrical architectures. The as-prepared final architectures exhibited an open network structure with a continuous ion transport network, resulting in unrivaled charge storage capacity (409 F g(- 1) at 1 A g(- 1)) and rate capability (56 F g(- 1) at 100 A g(- 1)) while maintaining their strong flexible nature...|$|R
