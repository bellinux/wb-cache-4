5|$|A {{hospital}} was established at Fort Russell for U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In August 1840, the Army surgeon {{at the hospital}} treated 103 patients, including 23 for fever and 26 for dysentery. Dysentery was {{the leading cause of}} death at the fort, followed by malaria, tuberculosis, gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the {{fatalities}} listed {{occurred on}} St Peter's Field. Others, such as John Lees of Oldham, died later of their <b>wounds,</b> <b>and</b> some like Joshua Whitworth {{were killed in}} the rioting that followed the crowd's dispersal from the field.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E

25|$|Historian Robert F. O'Neill {{states that}} {{at least three of}} the Union troopers were killed, one mortally <b>wounded,</b> 14 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> {{captured}}, 19 captured <b>and</b> 4 seriously <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> left at a nearby home. The walking <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> able-bodied were taken along by the Confederates as prisoners.|$|R
5|$|Alexander Rueda {{was treated}} at Washoe Medical Center for his <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> {{released}} the same day, while Kenzie McKeon only {{needed to be}} treated at the scene for superficial wounds. The school was placed on lockdown {{for an hour and}} then classes were canceled {{for the remainder of the}} day. The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.|$|E

In addition, two personnel were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of {{penetrating}} {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> shrapnel from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within the chest are deep and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from penetrating trauma occurs within the chest. Injury to the cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (front) part of the trachea.|$|E
50|$|Total British {{losses in}} the {{campaign}} {{after the fall of}} Fort Cornelis amounted to 141 killed, 733 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 13 missing from the Army, and 15 killed, 45 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> three missing from the Navy; a total of 156 killed, 788 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 16 missing by 27 August.|$|R
50|$|Iraqi {{casualties}} were 359-431 dead. More than 300 were <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 1,000 captured. U.S. losses were 32 dead, 60 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 6 captured.|$|R
25|$|Branch {{had lost}} 64 killed, 101 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 413 {{captured}} or missing, compared to Burnside's 90 killed, 380 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> {{a single man}} captured.|$|R
5|$|In {{his final}} {{report on the}} campaign, General Krueger {{reported}} 3,280 Japanese dead had been counted and 75 had been captured. Perhaps 1,100 more were missing, and were never seen again. American casualties were 326killed, 1,189wounded, and four missing. Some 1,625Americans had been evacuated for all causes, including <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> illness. One Australian was wounded. ANGAU reported one native had been killed and one wounded in action, three {{were killed by the}} Japanese, and 20accidentally killed and 34wounded by air, artillery, and naval bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{fighting}} the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties, the bulk of them from the Second AIF. This included 11,323 killed in action, 1,794 died of <b>wounds,</b> <b>and</b> 21,853 wounded. 5,558 were killed or died in captivity, while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war. Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded/injured in operational areas, and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded/injured in non-operational areas. The large number of non-battle casualties was significant, illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army.|$|E
5|$|In total, 1,650 Whites {{died in the}} Red terror, while around 10,000 Reds {{perished in}} the White terror, which {{eventually}} became political cleansing. The White victims have been recorded exactly, while in particular {{the number of the}} Red troopers executed immediately after the combats remains unclear. Together with the prison camp experiences of the Reds in summer 1918, the executions caused the deepest mental war <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> scars among the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those, who carried out the killings were seriously traumatized, a phenomenon that was later to become well-documented.|$|E
5000|$|Operations {{near the}} town {{involved}} 90,000 German troops and 300 German tanks, opposed by 42,500 French soldiers and 130 French tanks.

5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It {{can be used to make}} indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev.|$|E
50|$|The Continental troops lost {{thirteen}} killed, 49 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> nine missing on June 23; of whom six killed, 31 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> three missing {{were from}} Angell’s Rhode Island Regiment. Thomas Fleming {{says that the}} Pennsylvania Packet of July 8, 1780 reported that the militia casualties for the whole period of June 7-23 were ten killed, forty <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> ten prisoners. Including the Continental Army losses on June 7, which were twelve killed, fifty <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> thirteen missing, the combined American casualties for June 7 and June 23 were 35 killed, 139 <b>wounded,</b> ten prisoners <b>and</b> 22 missing.|$|R
50|$|The British {{official}} casualty return gave 14 killed, 77 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 21 missing, {{with the}} loss of Norton's Native Americans not included. Historian Robert Malcomson has demonstrated this computation to be in error and shows that the British and Canadian losses were 16 killed, 83 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 21 captured, with a further 5 killed, 2 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 1 captured among the Native American contingent. This gives a total loss of 21 killed, 85 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 22 captured. Among the wounded Canadians was James Secord, husband of Laura Secord.|$|R
25|$|From December 25, 1814, to January 26, 1815, British {{casualties}} {{during the}} Louisiana Campaign, {{apart from the}} assault on January 8, were 49 killed, 87 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 4 missing. Thus, British casualties for the entire campaign totaled 2,459 with 386 killed, 1,521 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 552 missing. American casualties for the entire campaign totaled 333 with 55 killed, 185 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 93 missing.|$|R
5|$|The {{gates of}} the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with {{depletion}} gilding. The process was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy {{is thought to have}} begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400BC) used copper for sterilizing <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mina finds Hansel {{hanging from}} a tree. She takes him to a nearby spring where she heals his <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> makes love to him. Gretel {{searches}} for Hansel in the forest, but is attacked by Sheriff Berringer and his posse. The men capture and beat Gretel before being stopped by Edward who kills the sheriff and his men. Edward tends Gretel's <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> tells her that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin which they discover is both a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand white witch named Adrianna who married a farmer. On {{the night of the}} last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna too powerful and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, Muriel revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
50|$|The French lost 1,300 killed, <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> captured. There were 23 {{officers}} killed <b>and</b> 55 <b>wounded,</b> including Lorcet. Del Parque's army suffered 713 killed <b>and</b> <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 1 gun captured.|$|R

5|$|After a {{month with}} his new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> the effects of gas poisoning. It {{is not clear whether}} he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back. Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the surrender of}} Marengo, Captain Bruilhac surrendered Belle Poule, the damage inflicted by Amazon {{and the presence of}} Warren's squadron persuading him that further resistance was hopeless. French losses in the engagement were severe, Marengo suffering extensive damage to her hull and rigging and losing 63 men killed and 83 wounded from a crew of 740. The latter included both Linois and his son with serious <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> Captain Vrignaud, who had to have his right arm amputated. Losses on Belle Poule included six killed and 24 wounded from her complement of 330. British losses were comparatively light, London suffering ten dead and 22 wounded and Amazon four killed and five wounded. London was the only British ship damaged, mainly in her rigging, which was hastily repaired {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The {{casualties}} {{of the day}} amounted to {{a hundred and fifty}} animals, and a hundred followers killed. Of the combatants two officers were <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> fourteen Gordons were <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> four killed.|$|R
25|$|The {{next morning}} they re-crossed {{the bar and}} sailed away. Hermes had lost 17 killed in action, 5 mortally <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 19 <b>wounded,</b> while Sophie had 6 killed in action, 4 mortally <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> the Carron had one mortally <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 5 <b>wounded.</b> In all, {{including}} the marine killed on shore (Charles Butcher), the British lost 34 killed <b>and</b> 35 <b>wounded</b> in the land and naval attacks, while the Americans lost only four men killed and five or more wounded. Percy's court-martial {{for the loss of}} Hermes concluded that the circumstances had warranted the attack.|$|R
50|$|Fifth Army {{casualties}} for 22 October were 60 men killed, 398 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 21 men missing; approximately 125 German {{troops were}} captured.
