5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and knew <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> proceed.

2500|$|The game {{uses the}} S.A.G.A. game engine created by game {{developer}} The Dreamers Guild. Players participate in each adventure through a screen that {{is divided into}} five sections. The action window is the largest part of the screen and is where the player directs the main characters through their adventures.

The sentence line is directly beneath the action window.

[...] He became so displeased that when an imperial edict was read out loud, honoring him referred to him as [...] "Our friend from when we wore civilian clothing," [...] he loudly replied, [...] "When your subject was wearing civilian clothing, Your Imperial Majesty was a prefect; now that Your Imperial Majesty is the Son of Heaven, you no longer need this old subject." [...] After making the comment, he went home and expected punishment. [...] Emperor Liezu issued another edict thanking him but not giving him additional responsibilities. [...] Unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> regain the emperor's trust, he submitted petitions requesting that Yang Pu (whom Emperor Liezu continued to honor as a retired emperor and allowed to live at the palace in Guangling, while Southern Tang's capital was set at Jinling (i.e., Sheng Prefecture)) be moved out of Guangling and be given a lesser title, so that people would not be tempted to rebel to restore Wu, and that the marriage between Emperor Liezu's daughter Princess Yongxing and Yang Pu's son Yang Lian the Duke of Hongnong (the former crown prince) be severed. [...] Emperor Liezu did not accept either proposal. [...] When Song again objected in 938 that, as Left Prime Minister, he {{should be allowed to}} participate in the governance, Emperor Liezu gave the excuse that the office building had not been built yet. [...] Meanwhile, apparently accepting one of Song's ideas after all (and with Yang Pu himself being uncomfortable remaining at Guangling as a former emperor), Emperor Liezu moved Yang Pu and the former Wu imperial family from Guangling to Run Prefecture and put them under secure guard. [...] Still, when Song subsequently again complained about being separated from the emperor by wicked people, Emperor Liezu became publicly angry, causing Song to again return to his home to wait for punishment. [...] When others spoke on his behalf, Emperor Liezu commented, [...] "Song Qiqiu is talented but does not know what is appropriate." [...] He sent Xu Jingtong (whose name would soon thereafter be changed to Li Jing by this point and who had, as the emperor's oldest son, been created the Prince of Wu, as Emperor Liezu had himself restored his birth name of Li in order to claim legitimate succession from Tang Dynasty, apparently under a suggestion initially made by Song) to Song's mansion to recall him to the government, and Song subsequently returned. [...] Subsequently, Emperor Liezu accepted another suggestion of Song's — that when a Khitan emissary arrived, the emissary was treated with great honors, {{but as soon as the}} emissary headed north, back across the Huai River (i.e., now in Later Jin territory), assassins were sent to kill him, so that the killing could be blamed on Later Jin. [...] It was said that this incident did bring frictions between Later Jin and Khitan (whose aid was critical in Later Jin's establishment). [...] Meanwhile, it was also at Song's proposal (although apparently a proposal driven by Emperor Liezu himself) that when Emperor Liezu established the seven imperial ancestral temples, while most of the temples were dedicated to Emperor Liezu's biological Li ancestors, Emperor Liezu's adoptive father Xu Wen was given one of the three most honored temple positions (and given the temple name of Yizu), along with Tang's first two emperors Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong.|$|E
