5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used.|$|E
5|$|Many Black Hebrew {{groups were}} {{founded in the}} United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from Kansas to New York City, by both African Americans and West Indian immigrants. In the mid-1980s, the number of Black Hebrews in the United States was between 25,000 and 40,000. In the 1990s, the Alliance of Black Jews (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer operating) {{estimated}} that there were 200,000 African-American Jews; this estimate {{was based on a}} 1990 survey conducted by the Council of Jewish Federations. The exact number of Black Hebrews within that surveyed group remains unspecified.|$|E

5|$|Since 1985, Gibraltar has {{undergone}} major changes {{as a result}} of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on tourism, financial services, shipping and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with its own parliament and government, though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success has made it one of the wealthiest areas of the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer in existence, {{for the garden}} of the Honourable MrsCholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and {{it was from the}} 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas is a rodent in {{the genus}} Juliomys of the {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae known {{from a single}} broken skull. The specimen was collected by Peter Wilhelm Lund in the caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century and described by Herluf Winge in 1887 as Calomys anoblepas. The species remained unstudied and its affinities unclear until 2011, when it was recognized as a member of the genus Juliomys, which includes three other species from southern Brazil and nearby Argentina and Paraguay. J.anoblepas is probably a separate extinct species of the genus, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer found at Lagoa Santa.|$|E

5|$|The caliche was {{the main}} source of iodine in the 19th century and {{continues}} to be important today, replacing kelp (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer an economically viable source), but in the late 20th century brines emerged as a comparable source. The Japanese Minami Kanto gas field east of Tokyo and the American Anadarko Basin gas field in northwest Oklahoma are the two largest such sources. The brine is hotter than 60°C from the depth of the source. The brine is first purified and acidified using sulfuric acid, then the iodide present is oxidised to iodine with chlorine. An iodine solution is produced, but is dilute and must be concentrated. Air is blown into the solution to evaporate the iodine, which is passed into an absorbing tower where sulfur dioxide reduces the iodine. The hydrogen iodide (HI) is reacted with chlorine to precipitate the iodine. After filtering and purification the iodine is packed.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named as Clavaria {{botrytis}} in 1797 by Christian Hendrik Persoon. In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned the genus name Clavaria, and treated Ramaria as {{a section of}} Clavaria. It was given its current name in 1918 by Adalbert Ricken. Obsolete historical synonyms include Gotthold Hahn's 1883 Corallium botrytis and A. A. Pearson's variety Clavaria botrytis var. alba, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer recognized as an independent taxon. Currie Marr and Daniel Stuntz described the variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa in their 1973 monograph of western Washington Ramaria; Edwin Schild and G.Ricci described variety compactospora from Italy in 1998. In 1950, E.J.H. Corner published George F. Atkinson's 1908 Clavaria holorubella as R.botrytis var. holorubella, but this taxon {{is now known as}} the independent species Ramaria holorubella.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2009 {{the main}} {{collection}} was housed in this single new {{building and the}} collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library {{announced that it would}} be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer in use.|$|E
