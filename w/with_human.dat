5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange <b>with</b> <b>human</b> rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants <b>with</b> <b>human</b> strains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Memories {{are vital}} in human {{interact}}ions. To interact sociably <b>with</b> a <b>human,</b> a robot {{should not only}} recognize and express emotions like a human, but also share emotional experience <b>with</b> <b>humans.</b> We present an affective human-robot communication system for a humanoid robot, AMI, which we designed to enable high-level communication <b>with</b> a <b>human</b> through dialogue. AMI communicates <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> by preserving emotional memories of users and topics, and it naturally engages in dialogue <b>with</b> <b>humans.</b> Humans therefore perceive AMI to be more human-like and friendly. Thus, interaction between AMI and humans is enhanced. ...|$|R

In all but large breeds, sociosexual interest arises around 6–9months, becoming emotionally adult around 15–18 months and fully mature around 3–4 years, although as <b>with</b> <b>humans</b> learning and refinement continue thereafter.|$|R

5|$|People with AIDS have an {{increased}} risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV. The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%. Both these cancers are associated <b>with</b> <b>human</b> herpesvirus 8. Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association <b>with</b> <b>human</b> papillomavirus (HPV). Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.|$|E

Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.|$|E
