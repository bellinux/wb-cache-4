500|$|The new station {{opened on}} 10 August 1885, and was {{originally}} known as [...] "Patchway & Stoke Gifford", but reverted to [...] "Patchway" [...] from 27 October 1908. The station {{was on a}} north/south alignment and had two platforms, separated by two running lines, with a third line, a goods loop, behind the western platform. There was a goods yard {{to the south of}} the station on the eastern side, with an adjacent signal box. As now, the eastern platform was for trains towards Bristol, the western platform for trains towards Wales. The station buildings were of a standard 1880s GWR design, with tall chimneys and fretted wooden canopies. The main building was on the eastern platform, containing the booking office, toilets, and waiting rooms. A matching brick shelter with canopy was built on the western platform. The eastern platform also had a [...] "bicycle house" [...] at the northern end. A large covered and glazed footbridge linked the two platforms. The goods yard included two sidings: a short, south-facing one adjacent to a loading dock; and a longer north-facing one. There was also a <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge,</b> coal office. At {{the north end of the}} station was a south-facing siding and an oil store. The station did not have a dedicated approach road as it was adjacent to the road between Gloucester Road to the west and Gypsy Patch Lane to the south. The road subsequently became known as Station Road. At the time of construction, the station was mostly surrounded by fields, with the Bristol conurbation almost [...] away.|$|E

40|$|For assuring {{the design}} of a produk, the design itself holds an {{important}} matter. As a designer, we face problems that we must create the strong design but must fullfil others points, like a light weight structure, competitive prizes, and many other point. Usually in the daily life, where the design is too strong and powerfull so that makes extra budget at the production process. In other hand, we also meet the opposite situation, when the design were sacrificed for the sake of production cost. In this calculation of the <b>weighing</b> <b>bridge</b> models, the finite element method based on ANSYS software were chosen because of the manual calculation were to difficult to solve the calculation and also takes longer time to accomplished. Meanwhile, Pugh?s concept selection method were chosen because of its efficiency for choosing the best solution from adequate solution that were born from the calculation. So we can choose the best solution based on this method, in both side, the strength of the structure and also the production cost.

50|$|The station boasted limited goods facilities, with {{a cattle}} dock and <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge</b> {{provided}} for the mainly agricultural traffic. Until the mid-1930s, goods trains would shunt the siding daily with regular loads of pink roadstone granite as well as coal for W. Palmer & Son, local coal merchants.

50|$|The {{location}} of the Adelphi ironworks {{and the start of}} the canal were situated just {{to the north of the}} present {{location of}} Arkwright Town. The village was originally on the south side of the Chesterfield road, but was demolished and a new village built to the north of the road, as the houses were affected by methane gas from the mines. Remnants of the works were preserved in the buildings of Works Farm until at least the 1980s, but recent mining expansion has resulted in the surrounding area becoming a vast opencast mining site, and nearly all traces of the canal and the ironworks have gone. Even the course of the Pool Brook is gone, as the land has been stripped away, although the <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge</b> and pattern shop still remain.|$|E
50|$|Tea, coffee, coir, {{cotton and}} other export {{consignments}} came here by wagonloads from the harbour, to be loaded to distant destinations across the world. Its strategic location {{made it a}} strong revenue-pulling base for freight traffic. A separate Coal Berth had to be built next to the wharf to cater to the terminus's constant demand for fuel.A station named Cochin Berth Station was also constructed near Cochin port so that trains from Cochin Harbour Terminus railway station will come there to offload passengers and freight directly to the ships waiting on the side. This station is less than 10 metres from the water.There was a 60-ton railway <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge</b> in the railway station which used to weigh tea that arrived from Mettupalayam by Tea Garden Express.The 1980s saw significant growth in passenger and freight traffic from the station. A new container yard was built and storage facilities for ammonia, sulphur and coal were started near the station.|$|E
5000|$|South Leigh {{station was}} opened by the Witney Railway on 14 November 1861. It is {{possible}} that the station was not yet fully constructed when opened as records show evidence of works in November and December 1861. When eventually completed, the station had a single low and short platform and a simple, unpretentious hip-roofed rectangular timber station building, which was a smaller version of that at [...] Perhaps in recognition {{of the fact that the}} community served at South Leigh was only a small agricultural village, there was no goods shed or loading crane; instead, a single siding served a small goods yard. There was no signalling and the basic track layout was controlled by three ground frames. A corrugated iron hut was situated on the platform and served as a goods lock-up and parcels shed. A cattle dock and <b>weigh</b> <b>bridge</b> were also on or near the platform. Outbuildings were later provided to house toilets.|$|E
50|$|Three {{major new}} bridges were {{installed}} on the line between March and May 2008.

40|$|Systems for {{weighing}} vehicles {{while they are}} in motion are in widespread use in many countries. The accuracy of these weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems is strongly influenced by the road profile and vehicle dynamics. Systems based on sensors that are embedded in the pavement or placed {{on top of the}} road surface can only measure the axle load for the fraction of a second for which the wheels are present on the sensor. An alternative to pavement WIM systems that increases the length of the load-sensitive element is to use an existing <b>bridge</b> as a <b>weighing</b> scales (<b>Bridge</b> WIM). A major test of a Bridge WIM system at a test site near the Arctic Circle is described in this paper...|$|R
