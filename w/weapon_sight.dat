25|$|The AN/PSQ-20, {{manufactured}} by ITT (also {{known as the}} Enhanced Night Vision Goggle, ENVG), seeks to combine thermal imaging with image intensification, as does the Northrop Grumman Fused Multispectral <b>Weapon</b> <b>Sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of ATG {{can easily be}} seen not only during day-night-day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low light to high light conditions (above 1 lx), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures taken at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain “eyes on target”.|$|E
2500|$|To {{increase}} shooting accuracy {{they employ}} shooting support {{devices such as}} [...] the holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sight,</b> AMT reflex sights, Schmidt & Bender 1.5 - 6 x 42 daylight sights, Simrad KN250F night vision sights, Zeiss Diavari daylight sights, Varo AN/PVS-4 night vision sights, EDS laser sights and Sure-Fire flashlights.|$|E
50|$|Other {{attachments}} are red dot <b>sights</b> or holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> {{similar to}} EOTech.|$|R

2500|$|The {{attacks were}} carried out with a stolen Bushmaster XM-15 (AR-15 style) semiautomatic [...]223 caliber rifle {{equipped}} with an EOTech holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> which is effective at ranges of up to [...] found in the vehicle. The trunk of the Chevrolet Caprice was modified {{to serve as a}} [...] "rolling sniper's nest". [...] The back seat was modified to allow a person access to the trunk. Once inside, the sniper could lie prone with shots taken from a small hole near the license plate created for that purpose.|$|E
5000|$|A thermographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sight,</b> {{thermal imagery}} scope or thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> is a {{sighting}} device combining a compact thermographic camera and an aiming reticle. They can be {{mounted on a}} variety of small arms as well as some heavier weapons.|$|E

50|$|EOTech is an American {{company that}} designs, manufactures, and markets {{electro-optic}} products and systems. The company is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They produce holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> for small arms {{that have been}} adopted by various military and law enforcement agencies as close quarters battle firearm sights.|$|R
50|$|In April 2017, YAT aided US {{special forces}} in {{capturing}} parts of Tabqa Dam from ISIL. During the battle, YAT commandos were equipped with US-supplied combat helmets, AN/PVS-7 night vision devices, flashlights, and were armed with M4 carbines equipped with AN/PEQ-2 laser <b>sights,</b> holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights,</b> and STANAG magazines.|$|R

50|$|Land Warrior's {{software}} system was {{powered by a}} variant of the Linux operating system and has a modular, open architecture for further improvement. Reliability in recent testing at Fort Benning has been extremely high. The Land Warrior software suite contains six main software packages for <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> and for data.|$|R
50|$|It has a picatinny railing on the {{receiver}} to allow the installations of <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> like reflex sights with iron sights built into the railing. The weapon fires in a gas operated mode, utilizing rotary bolt locking and a gas piston. The MSMC can also be suppressed with the installation of a silencer.|$|R
50|$|Also a video <b>weapon</b> <b>sight</b> and {{reconnaissance}} 40mm ammunition {{are currently}} under development for future {{integration into the}} IdZ-program.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the Company {{was hired}} as a {{subcontractor}} to Raytheon, designing display electronics for a digital night vision <b>weapon</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} has Holosight, a non-magnifying {{holographic}} <b>weapon</b> <b>sight.</b> It produces an illuminated crosshair {{that appears to}} be in front of the gun in perfect alignment.|$|E
50|$|Thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> {{are often}} used by hunters {{to aid in the}} {{detection}} of game, such as feral hogs, coyotes, or rodents such as rats. The sight's ability to see unaided even in complete darkness allows the hunter to be undetected and aware of potential prey, facilitating a quick and precise takedown.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{accessories}} {{include the}} AN/PEQ-2, Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), and M68 CCO. EOTech holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> {{are part of}} the SOPMOD II package. Visible and IR (infrared) lights of various manufacturers are also commonly attached using various mounting methods. As with all versions of the M16, the M4 accepts a blank-firing attachment (BFA) for training purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Soldier & Vehicle Solutions {{provides}} uncooled microbolometer {{focal plane}} arrays; low power fusion electronics; image signal processing; IR missile seekers; semi active laser seekers; and imagers for remote weapon targeting.

50|$|The trifocal goggles however, didn't remain {{completely}} fictional. In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{produced and}} delivered one such device. The device, called Fused Multispectral <b>Weapon</b> <b>Sight</b> (FMWS) {{was capable of}} combining thermal and intensified imaging. Later in 2007, ITT Industries developed another such device, designated AN/PSQ-20.|$|E
50|$|Bell's first {{military}} contract {{followed in}} 1937 {{with the development}} of the ill-fated YFM-1 Airacuda, an unconventional bomber-destroyer powered by two Allison-powered pusher propellers. The YFM-1 incorporated groundbreaking technology for the time, with gyro stabilized <b>weapons</b> <b>sighting</b> and a thermionic fire control system. Including the prototype, just 13 Airacudas were produced, and these saw only limited service with the USAAC before being scrapped in 1942.|$|R
50|$|As {{with regular}} {{ultraviolet}} sensors, thermal <b>weapon</b> <b>sights</b> can operate in total darkness. The thermal scope {{can be quite}} useful in places with snow as the extreme difference in temperatures between the snow and any source of heat (such as a human) creates a high visual contrast between the two. This {{makes it easy to}} locate any source of heat against its low-temperature background.|$|R
50|$|Bushnell Corporation, {{also known}} as Bushnell Outdoor Products, is an American company specializing in optics and imaging, and a {{subsidiary}} of Vista Outdoor. Bushnell's products include binoculars, spotting scopes, telescopes, night vision equipment, GPS devices, laser rangefinders, riflescopes, holographic <b>weapon</b> <b>sights,</b> game cameras and other high-end optical equipment.
