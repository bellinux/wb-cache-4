During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sewerage,</b> though reticulated services for both are now connected.

The Public Health Act 1875 consolidated this legislation. The purpose of the special drainage district was to create a tax raising body to provide works in areas where there was no sanitary authority. They were renamed [...] "special purpose areas" [...] when rural district councils were created in 1894. The Local Government Act 1929 permitted rural district councils to absorb the district and pay for works out of the general rate.
