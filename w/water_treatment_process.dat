40|$|Abstract Groundwater {{supplies}} on the Canadian prairies {{are often}} contaminated with arsenic, {{high levels of}} sulphate, ammonium or nitrate, iron and manganese as well as organic material. These typically brackish water sources (TDS levels> 1000 mg/L) are supplying potable and non-potable water requirements of water-short communities. The high cost of supplying better quality water (pipelines) to remote native communities sparked the development of <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>processes</b> that can effectively deal with local water sources. During {{the past four years}} <b>treatment</b> <b>processes</b> for these poor quality groundwater sources have been developed. A community with a long-standing boil water advisory (total duration 9 years), Yellow Quill First Nation, was selected for the initial evaluation and development of different <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>processes.</b> During a 20 month on-site pilot conventional (including manganese greensand), advanced (including ozone), and emerging (including biological) <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>processes</b> were evaluated.
