This attracted {{a great deal of}} attention because of their gender, and the newspapers called it The Women's Strike. They succeeded and their salary was raised, though it was lowered again just a few years later. Mursmäckas became members of the Bricklayers' Union after it was founded in 1897. In 1904, a new work regulation was enforced in which an entire construction work team was paid according to how much they could work, which in effect meant that they could raise their salaries and split it among them if they could keep up a high <b>work</b> <b>speed.</b> The consequence was that the male workers became less willing to include women in their teams, as they doubted that they could keep the same <b>work</b> <b>speed</b> as their male colleagues, which because of the new regulation would affect the income of the whole team. This meant that the mursmäcka's had to start to compete with male rivals performing the same tasks as they in the work team.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{construction}} cranes {{where the}} <b>work</b> <b>speed</b> {{was determined by}} the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbor cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4 m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together. Their capacity was 2-3 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo. Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbor cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe. Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Danzig, Cologne and Bremen. Beside these stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.|$|E

In this grinding system PZT actuating table and templates are used together with personal computer. Conventional surface grinding machine is used. Computer is used to measure straightness of ground surface and to move the actuating table along the compensating profile. In the case {{on the condition of}} little movement deviation of table in z direction by repeated feed operations, compensating grinding method using personal computer and actuating table is effective. From the experiments 0. 2 μm of straightness along 250 mm length at 6 mm width is obtained on the condition of <b>work</b> <b>speed</b> v= 50 mm/s. and depth of cut 1 μm. Further precise compensating grinding system is proposed. Template is set nearly and parallel to the work and displacement sensor is installed under the arm fixed on the column.

So the work is ground to the similar profile as template.
