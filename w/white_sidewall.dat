2500|$|The Caprice Estate, a new {{station wagon}} model with {{simulated}} woodgrain exterior trim {{was the first}} Chevrolet with such a design since its real woodie wagon was offered in 1954. All wagons included an all-vinyl upholstered two-row bench seat interior with an optional third rear-facing seat for two. The [...] V8 engine was standard for Caprice models with the [...] "Turbo Jet" [...] V8 optional. It was possible to have Regular Production Option (RPO) L72, a 425-hp big block V8 with solid lifters, special camshaft and carburetor, and 11 to 1 compression. An automatic transmission, power steering, <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> tires and a vinyl top (on the hardtops) were extra-cost options, but most were built with them. Additionally, air conditioning, power windows, Cruise-Master speed control, power seats, an automatic headlight dimmer (1965 only) and stereo radios were available.|$|E

50|$|Later, entirely black tires became {{available}} with <b>white</b> <b>sidewalls</b> being {{covered with a}} somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber. By compressing the white rubber through the letter cutouts in the black outer layer, it gave the effect of raised white letter tires.|$|R
50|$|Early {{automobile}} tires {{were made}} of pure natural rubber with various chemicals mixed into the tread compounds to make them wear better. The best of these was zinc oxide, a pure white substance that increased traction and also made the entire tire white. However, the white rubber did not offer sufficient endurance, so carbon black {{was added to the}} rubber to greatly increase tread life. Using carbon black only in the tread produced tires with inner and outer <b>sidewalls</b> of <b>white</b> rubber. Later, entirely black tires became available, the still extant <b>white</b> <b>sidewalls</b> being covered with a somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber. Should a black sidewall tire have been severely scuffed against a curb, the underlying white rubber would be revealed; it is in a similar manner that raised white letter (RWL) tires are made.|$|R
40|$|Issue: Practical rubber {{compounds}} {{require the}} incorporation of petroleum oils and plasticizers to make them processable. Best Practice: Rubber polymers are high viscosity liquids. Inorganic fillers and carbon black are added to reinforce the rubber polymer. This increases the viscosity even further. To reduce the viscosity, improve processing and flow and reduce cost softeners (oils and plasticizers) {{are added to the}} rubber compound. Almost all rubber compounds are softened. Levels used vary from 5 - 10 phr for high performance treads like aircraft and off the road tires to several hundred phr in highly oil extended EPDM hose and extruded goods. Plasticizing oils are arbitrarily divided into aliphatic, napththenic, and aromatic classes. The most widely used class is the aromatic oil. It is commonly added to passenger and truck tire treads, carcasses, and sidewalls as well as other components. Napththenic oils are added to <b>white</b> <b>sidewalls</b> and other components requiring non-staining properties. The recent trend in lowering the low rolling resistance of passenger tires has resulted in more napththenic oil being used in treads and carcasses. It should be noted that in the recycled rubber material, there is a residual oil from the original compounds in tires and non-tire products. A small amount of oil may volatize in service. However most of it is stil...|$|R
5000|$|Whitewall tires or <b>white</b> <b>{{sidewall}}</b> (WSW) {{tires are}} tires having a stripe or entire sidewall of white rubber. These tires were {{most commonly used}} from the early 1900s to around the mid 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The cars also {{featured}} a curved windshield, replacing the two piece windshield used on previous models. Passenger compartment heater, electric clock, power brakes, power steering and <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> tires were all available as options.|$|E
50|$|Inside, the Riviera {{featured}} a four-place cabin with front bucket seats {{separated by a}} center console with floor shifter and storage compartment that was built into the instrument panel, and bucket-style seats in the rear. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl, cloth and vinyl, or optional leather. A deluxe interior option included real walnut inserts on the doors and below the rear side windows.

5000|$|A {{total of}} 50 {{identical}} experimental Turbine Cars were built between October 1963 and October 1964. Huebner {{referred to the}} experimental cars as uniquely designed. Each body was finished and shipped to Detroit and then the employees installed the gas turbine engines, Torqueflite transmissions, and electrical components to prepare the cars for use. There were 203 nationwide motorists - 23 of them women - who were chosen to test the uniquely designed automobiles. Suspension did not follow Chrysler's ubiquitous independent front longitudinal torsion bar system of the time, but rather featured contemporary designs using independent front suspension with a coil spring at each wheel. Rear suspension was more typical of Chrysler, with leaf springs and direct-acting shock absorbers.The Turbine Car is a two-door hardtop coupe with four individual bucket seats, power steering, air-over-oil power brakes, and power windows. Its most prominent design features are two large horizontal taillights and nozzles (back-up lights) mounted inside a very heavy chrome sculptured bumper. Up front, the single headlamps are mounted in chrome nacelles with a turbine styling theme which is carried through to the center console and the hubcaps. Even the tires were specially made with small turbine vanes molded into the <b>white</b> <b>sidewalls.</b> The body is finished in a metallic, root beer-colored paint dubbed [...] "turbine bronze". The roof is covered in black vinyl, and the interior features bronze-colored [...] "English calfskin" [...] leather upholstery with plush-cut pile bronze-colored carpet. Front suspension is upper and lower wishbones with coil springs and shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{fire started}} at Cotton's Wharf on Tooley Street, near to St Olave's Church, Southwark, London. The wharf was around 100 x 50 ft, and {{contained}} around 5,000 tons of rice, 10,000 barrels of tallow, 1,000 tons of hemp, 1,100 tons of jute, 3,000 tons {{of sugar and}} 18,000 bales of cotton {{at the time of}} the fire. The cause of the fire is believed to have been spontaneous combustion. There had been fires nearby in 1836, when Topping's Wharf was destroyed, and 1841. The fire was first noticed around 4p.m., and by 6p.m., 14 fire engines, including one steam engine, from the London Fire Engine Establishment were at the scene. Over 30,000 people watched the fire burn, and the fire took two weeks to put out, during which time around 20 police officers remained present at the scene. In total, the damages from the fire were around £2 million. The fire caused damage to buildings up to 0.25 mi away from Cotton's Wharf, and destroyed 11 acre of land. The London Bridge railway station also caught fire in the blaze. At the time, the fire was described as the worst London fire since the Great Fire of London. In his diary, Arthur Munby described the scene as:"For near a quarter of a mile, the south bank of the Thames was on fire: a long line of what had been warehouses, their roofs and fronts all gone; and the tall ghastly <b>sidewalls,</b> <b>white</b> with heat, standing, or rather tottering, side by side in the midst of a mountainous desert of red & black ruin, which smouldered & steamed here, & there, sent up sheets of savage intolerable flame a hundred feet high."During the fire, a section of a warehouse collapsed on top of James Braidwood, the superintendent of the London Fire Engine Establishment (later the London Fire Brigade), killing him.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} facelift, the biggest news was the {{addition}} of a Super DeLuxe version (which came equipped with a radio, a cigarette lighter, and <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> tires). Total weight for the base model truck crept up to 540 kg. The Snowler and Panel Van models continued to be available, making for a total of 28 various models. The range grew further in July 1970, when a pickup version with fixed sides and a rear gate (instead of the three-way fold down beds used so far) was added.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-1960s, the Table Top Classics series {{included}} {{a selection of}} American and European luxury cars of the 1930s in approximately 1/32 scale. These kits included plated parts as well as rubber tires, sometimes with wide <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> inserts. Original copies {{of many of these}} kits can still be found today, though a few are quite rare and command high prices at auction. Some entries in this series were the ’32 Pierce Arrow Roadster; ’32 Chrysler LeBaron; ’32 Packard Roadster; Rolls Royce Sedanca; ’32 Lincoln KB Sport convertible and Town Car and the Duesenberg SSJ Roadster.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, Chrysler {{returned}} the Fury to the new, full-size Chrysler C-body platform. The new 1965 Plymouth line included three special Furys: the Fury I, Fury II, and Fury III. The Fury I was the basic model, while the Fury II and Fury III offered more trim and features. Full size Furys had options such as automatic transmission, power steering, <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> tires (along with full wheel covers), stereo radios, vinyl tops, and air conditioning. The Sport Fury {{was the highest}} trim and feature model positioned {{to compete with the}} Chevrolet Caprice Super Sport and Ford Galaxie 500/XL. It offered a sportier interior and exterior trim package. The Fury II was available as a two-door hardtop in Canada only; in the U.S. it was only available as a two- or four-door sedan, and a station wagon.|$|E

5000|$|In 1974 a wide eggcrate grille was used. Dual round {{headlamps}} were mounted {{close together}} in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared {{in about the}} same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with the tail light built in. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Unlike the other [...] "C" [...] body GM coupes, the Coupe de Ville was no a longer true hardtop, instead sporting large wide [...] "coach" [...] windows giving a thick center pillar look. They retained their frameless door glass, however. The Sedan de Ville continued as a true hardtop however, and would remain so until the 1977 model. A new curved instrument panel housed a digital clock. New standard features included an integral litter container. A Space Saver spare tire was standard when DeVilles were ordered with optional <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> steel belted radial tires.|$|E
5000|$|Standard tires in {{all three}} years were Michelin-X (225-15) steel-belted radials with a narrow <b>white</b> <b>sidewall</b> design.First {{optional}} in 1975, and remaining so {{through the end of}} the 1979 model year, were Goodyear's LR78-15" [...] Custom Polysteel radials, in a Lincoln-exclusive [...] "Dual-Wide Band White Sidewall" [...] design (a wider white stripe about one-half-inch past wheel rim diameter, followed by a second, narrow, quarter-inch white stripe, about a quarter-inch outside of the wider inside stripe). This tended to create a more formal, luxurious appearance that only accentuated Mark V's exaggerated long-hood, short-deck, low-roofline styling.Back inside the trunk, in Lincoln's attempt to eke out a small increase in the amount of available trunk space, was a new-for-1977, inflatable spare tire option (a pressurized canister of tire propellant was included) which would replace the standard conventional, full-size spare, This was available for all three years of the Mark V's run. Regardless of any exterior wheel option selected, the standard, conventional spare tire would be of either Michelin or Goodyear brand (matching the vehicle's four exterior tires), but would be mounted on a standard, 15-inch conventional steel wheel. Hardcore aficionados would go to their dealer's parts department and order an extra turbine style or forged aluminum wheel, and have the dealer remount their spare tire, so that now all five wheels matched one another. This practice of spare tire wheel-matching was standard on Mark IV, but fell off the roster beginning in 1977.|$|E
