25|$|The {{dominance}} of neoclassical sculpture lessened {{in the later}} 19th century, and the following generation of Birmingham sculptors was largely defined by {{its relationship with the}} Birmingham School of Art, which under Edward R. Taylor emphasised the relationship between high art and craftsmanship, and was closely aligned to Birmingham's dominant Civic Gospel ideology. Albert Toft was a prominent exponent of the New Sculpture, his works exhibiting the movement's characteristic naturalism in form and spiritualism in mood. Benjamin Creswick was the leading sculptor of the Arts and Crafts-dominated Birmingham Group, working {{in a wide variety of}} genres and expanding the iconography of Birmingham sculpture with imagery of <b>working</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> compositions examining the relationship between arts, crafts and learning.|$|E

500|$|In Europe {{there were}} {{typically}} two meals a day: dinner at mid-day and a lighter supper in the evening. The two-meal system remained consistent throughout the late Middle Ages. Smaller intermediate meals were common, but became {{a matter of}} social status, as {{those who did not}} have to perform manual labor could go without them. Moralists frowned on breaking the overnight fast too early, and members of the church and cultivated gentry avoided it. For practical reasons, breakfast was still eaten by <b>working</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> was tolerated for young children, women, the elderly and the sick. Because the church preached against gluttony and other weaknesses of the flesh, men tended to be ashamed of the weak practicality of breakfast. Lavish dinner banquets and late-night reresopers (from Occitan rèire-sopar, [...] "late supper") with considerable amounts of alcoholic beverage were considered immoral. The latter were especially associated with gambling, crude language, drunkenness, and lewd behavior. Minor meals and snacks were common (although also disliked by the church), and working men commonly received an allowance from their employers in order to buy nuncheons, small morsels to be eaten during breaks.|$|E
500|$|This {{transformation}} did {{not stop}} when the war ended; industrial production in the United States increased by 75% from 1865 to 1873, making the U.S. second only to Britain in manufacturing output. [...] Railroad construction made practical the exploitation of the trans-Mississippi West. Although the railroads helped fuel an economic boom, they proved a two-edged sword in the 1870s. [...] The 1872 [...] Crédit Mobilier scandal, over graft {{in the construction of}} the First Transcontinental Railroad, shook the Grant administration to its highest levels. [...] Railroad bankruptcies in the Panic of 1873 led to loss of jobs, wage cuts, and business failures. These disturbances culminated in the Railroad Strikes of 1877, when workers struck over cut wages and loss of jobs. The action originally started on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, but spread to other lines, including the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. Federal troops were sent by President Rutherford B. Hayes to quash the strikes, at the cost of over 100 civilian lives. The Lake Shore dispute, unlike those elsewhere, was settled without violence. Hay remained angry, and blamed foreign agitators for the dispute. He condemned the [...] "unarmed rebellion of foreign workingmen, mostly Irish" [...] and informed Stone by letter, [...] "the very devil seems to have entered into the lower classes of <b>working</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> there are plenty of scoundrels to encourage them to all lengths." ...|$|E
