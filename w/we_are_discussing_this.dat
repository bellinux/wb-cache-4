From online Personal Health Record (PHR), treatment and appointment reminders by SMS, to the e-mailing of confidential clinical data, healthcare systems are increasingly using technologies to provide better services with less financial and human resources. Among ICTs for health, eHealth - i. e. health on the Internet - has been extensively studied whereas the use of mobile technologies for health called "mhealth" or mobile Health has been less documented so far. In 2013, almost 6. 8 billion people were mobile phone users, mobile-cellular penetration rates stand at 96 % globally (89 % in developing countries). Access to the Internet, by comparison, is a reality for only 39 % of the world population (77 % of the developed world population is online). During the last three years, many health stakeholders and mobile technology providers have understood the high potential of mHealth and launched more than 600 operational projects in developing countries.

Furthermore <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>this</b> conflict {{through the use of a}} comparative analysis of the UN declaration and the Cairo Declaration, which is an alternate human rights declaration from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Since the OIC constitutes memberships of various Muslim countries, we can gain an understanding of what perceptions there exist within the Muslim world, and thereby take into account the criticism of the legitimacy of declaring the UN conventions universal, by the use of cultural relativism and meta-ethics as our theory of science. We are interested in locating the cornerstones of the cultural differences and the anti-thesis that constitutes the disagreement with UN’s human rights, and why they aren’t recognized as applicable in the Islamic world. Are the officially declared human rights a universal truth or a Western concept? Or is it something gradual in between? Conclusively, it is our understanding that it is indeed very difficult to put forward a universal document of what human rights are to count in all the world’s countries, but despite religious and cultural differences, there are several similarities in the declarations that reflect a somewhat common interest in human rights...|$|E

The study <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>this</b> morning is part of a proud tradition going back to 1961 and now leads us through the early twenty-first century. As many of you may remember, the first major IFLA initiative in international bibliographic control took place in 1961 at an international conference in Paris during which a set of cataloguing principles were approved [...] now known as the Paris Principles. In 1969 another important IFLA-sponsored conference was held in Copenhagen, whose purpose was to consider a resolution to establish international standards for the form and content of bibliographic descriptions. The results of this far-reaching resolution have been the International Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications, first published in 1971, and its successor standards for all formats. In 1977 the International Congress on National Bibliographies was held in Paris, which called for standards for the printed national bibliography. The congress participants also recommended that greater efforts at national international levels should be made to ensure compatibility between the bibliographic exchange formats of the library and information communities, and the establishment of ISDS centres. Another event of consequence took place in 1997 when the Standing Committee of the IFLA Section on Cataloguing approved the final report of a study on the functional requirements for bibliographic records.

Intrusion detection Systems faces a number of challenges, One component {{of this approach is}} that of network intrusion detection systems what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> in <b>this</b> paper uses Snort signature database. An intrusion detection system must reliably detect malicious activities in a network and must perform efficiently to cope with the large amount of network traffic. Making a network intrusion detection system work effectively should not degrade overall network performance so some type of performance measurement plan must be designed and implemented. Intrusion Detection Systems have become very popular in the recent years. This is due to the obvious explosive growth of the Internet and the fact that most us keep and access sensitive data online. In this paper, we have addressed these two issues of accuracy and efficiency using conditional random fields and layered approach. We have demonstrated that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using conditional random fields and high efficiency by implementing the layered approach.

Key Words: Par-asitology—Zoonosis—Vector-borne. 101 Moniliformis moniliformis IS AN acantho-cephalans or thorny-headed worm that is normally a parasite of the rat, the hamster, the white mouse, the cat, and the dog {{in most parts of the}} world. Species of the genera Macracan-thorhyncus and Moniliformis are the principle agents of acanthocephaliasis in humans (Mey-ers et al. 2000). Acanthocephalans are not pri-marily human parasites. The parasite must have at least two hosts in order to complete its life cycle. Intermediate hosts are either beetles or cockroaches, which must be eaten by a de-finitive host. Data on the pathogenesis of this worm are limited, and records in humans tend to be scarce (Gibson 1998). The acanthocepha-lan species found incidentally in humans have been reviewed by Schmidt (1971).
