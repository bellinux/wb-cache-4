5|$|The <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> {{has been}} {{upgraded}} from endangered to threatened. Collisions with boats and habitat loss are still its biggest threats.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee,</b> face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|The {{last of the}} sirenian {{families}} to appear, Trichechidae, apparently arose from early dugongids in the late Eocene or early Oligocene. It is a monophyletic taxa. In 1994, the family was expanded to not only include the subfamily Trichechinae (Potamosiren, Ribodon, and Trichechus), but also Miosireninae (Anomotherium and Miosiren). The African manatee and the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the Amazonian manatee.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves also support 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus manatus).|$|E

25|$|Manatees {{inhabit the}} shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (T. manatus, <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee),</b> the Amazon basin (T. inunguis, Amazonian manatee), and West Africa (T. senegalensis, West African manatee).|$|E
25|$|The <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> migrates into Florida rivers, {{such as the}} Crystal, the Homosassa, and the Chassahowitzka Rivers. The headsprings {{of these}} rivers {{maintain}} a 22°C (72°F) temperature all year. During November to March, about 400 West Indian manatees (according to the National Wildlife Refuge) congregate in the rivers in Citrus County, Florida.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} months, warm-water outfalls {{from the station}} draw dozens of West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees,</b> an {{endangered}} species, to the immediate vicinity of the plant. In 1986, TECO set aside a manatee viewing area which is accessible to the public.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{wildlife}} {{of the park}} are bald eagles, ospreys, owls, loggerhead sea turtles, West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees</b> and migratory shorebirds. The endangered gopher tortoise {{can also be found}} there. It is the only tortoise found east of the Mississippi River.|$|R

500|$|While at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Michelson {{worked on}} radar-based ocean {{surveillance}} systems and flew hardware test missions on a Lockheed Warning Star PO-1W Super Constellation. [...] In 1974 Michelson began {{work at the}} Georgia Tech Research Institute, where {{he got his first}} contract when an entry-level engineer (Research Engineer I). [...] This first project involved methods to electronically track the endangered species Trichechus manatus (<b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Manatee)</b> in the waters around the Kennedy Space Center.|$|E
500|$|Most {{national}} parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park {{was the first}} created to protect a fragile ecosystem. The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing [...] per day out of Lake Okeechobee, southwest into Florida Bay. The Park {{is the most significant}} breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere. It is home to 36threatened or protected species including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee,</b> and supports 350species of birds, 300species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40species of mammals, and 50species of reptiles. The majority of South Florida's fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park.|$|E
2500|$|West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees</b> prefer warmer {{temperatures}} and {{are known to}} congregate in shallow waters. [...] They frequently migrate through brackish water estuaries to freshwater springs. They cannot survive below 15°C (60°F). Their natural source for warmth during winter is warm, spring-fed rivers.|$|R
50|$|Found in {{and around}} Wakulla Springs are West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees,</b> white-tailed deer, North American river otters, American alligators, Suwannee River cooters (Pseudemys suwanniensis), {{snapping}} turtles, softshell turtles, limpkin, purple gallinules, herons, egrets, bald eagles, anhingas, ospreys, common moorhens, wood ducks, black vultures and turkey vultures.|$|R
2500|$|The {{coast of}} the state of Georgia is usually the northernmost range of the West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees</b> because their low {{metabolic}} rate does not protect them in cold water. Prolonged exposure to water temperatures below 20°C (68°F) can bring about [...] "cold stress syndrome" [...] and death.|$|R
500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee,</b> are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the African manatee is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to bulk feeding, dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of Amazonian manatees become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{proposed}} that the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> be reclassified from an [...] "endangered" [...] status to [...] "threatened" [...] as improvements to habitat conditions, population growth and reductions of threats have all increased. [...] The proposal will not affect current federal protections.|$|E

2500|$|Buffett {{has been}} {{involved}} in many charity efforts. In 1981 the Save the Manatee Club was founded by Buffett and former Florida governor Bob Graham. It is the world's leading manatee protection organization. <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Manatee</b> In 1989, legislation was passed in Florida that introduced the [...] "Save the Manatee" [...] license plate, and earmarked funding for the Save the Manatee Club. One of the two manatees trained to interact with researchers at Mote Marine Laboratory is named Buffett after the singer. Buffett is also a longtime supporter of and major donor to the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory.|$|E
2500|$|Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous {{marine mammals}} {{sometimes}} known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing {{three of the}} four living species in the order Sirenia: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to [...] long, weigh as much as , and have paddle-like flippers. The etymology of the name is dubious, with connections having been made to Latin [...] "manus" [...] (hand), and to a word sometimes cited as [...] "manati" [...] used by the Taíno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning [...] "breast". Manatees are occasionally called sea cows, as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> is {{a species}} {{distinct}} from the Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis) and the African manatee (T. senegalensis). Based on genetic and morphological studies, the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> {{is divided into two}} subspecies, the Florida manatee (T. m. latirostris) and the Antillean or Caribbean manatee (T. m. manatus). However, recent genetic (mtDNA) research suggests that the <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>manatee</b> actually consists of three groups, which are more or less geographically distributed as: (1) Florida and the Greater Antilles; (2) Mexico, Central America and northern South America; and (3) northeastern South America.|$|E
50|$|The Coastal Bend is {{a habitat}} for {{many types of}} {{vegetation}} and wildlife. Aransas National Wildlife Refuge {{is among the most}} prominent centers for wildlife. Wildlife found in the area includes the rare whooping crane, American alligators, nine-banded armadillos, West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees,</b> and numerous other species of wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Park {{wildlife}} includes white-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, wood {{ducks and}} great blue herons. There are also fish and reptiles: i.e. turtles, water snakes, American alligators, North American river otters, West <b>Indian</b> <b>manatees</b> {{in the winter}} months, crayfish, bream, bluegill, largemouth bass, alligator gar, mullet, catfish, and several types of minnows.|$|R
50|$|The Florida Wildlife Center is an American-based exhibit that {{stretches}} across nearly a half-mile, accessible through Asian Gardens.
