We observe that popular network models cannot explain decreasing power-law degree distribution exponent and increasing average degree at the same time.

Parameters of the average degree growth and the power-law degree distribu- tion exponent functions depend on the ratio of the network growth exponent parameters. Specifically, we connect the growth of the average degree to the decreasing exponent of the power-law degree distribution. Prior to our work, only one of the two cases were handled.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying the fluidized bed furnace {{to the solution}} and aging treatments of aluminum alloys was assessed by examining concerns such as the efficiency of heat treatments and delay of quenching, together with its merits such as the shortening of heat treatment {{and the possibility of}} high temperature heat treatments. It was concluded that this method realizes high efficiency of heat treatments, which is comparable to that attainable with the combination of a salt bath and oil bath. By suppressing the delay time within 20 to 30 sec. after the removal of works from the fluidized bed furnace, no degradation in mechanical properties occurs. The allowable delay time is dependent on the <b>work</b> <b>size.</b> The solution treatment time can be shortened to 60 min. or below. Good mechanical properties were obtained even with a short solution treatment time of 15 min. depending on the size and thickness of the work.

Trypanosoma cruzi oligopeptidase B (OPBTc) is involved in host cell invasion by generating a Ca 2 +-agonist necessary for recruitment and fusion of host lysosomes {{at the site of}} parasite attachment. The underlying mechanism remains unknown and further structural and functional characterization of OPBTc may help clarify its physiological function and lead to the development of new therapeutic molecules to treat Chagas disease. In the present <b>work,</b> <b>size</b> exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that OPBTc is a dimer in solution, an association salt and pH-resistant and independent of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The enzyme retains its dimeric structure and is fully active up to 42 °C. OPBTc is inactivated and its tertiary, but not secondary, structure is disrupted at higher temperatures, as monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. It has a highly stable secondary structure over a broad range of pH, undergoes subtle tertiary structure changes at low pH and is less stable under moderate ionic strength conditions. These results bring new insights into the structural properties of OPBTc, contributing to future studies on the rational design of OPBTc inhibitors as a promising strategy for Chagas disease chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—SUDA 2 is a {{recursive}} search algorithm for Minimal Unique Itemset detection. Such sets {{of items}} are formed via combinations of non-obvious attributes enabling individual record identification. The nature of SUDA 2 allows {{work to be}} divided into non-overlapping tasks enabling parallel execution. Earlier work developed a parallel implementation for SUDA 2 on an SMP cluster, and this {{was found to be}} several orders of magnitude faster than sequential SUDA 2. However, if fixedgranularity parallel tasks are scheduled naively in the order of their generation, the system load tends to be imbalanced with little work {{at the beginning and end}} of the search. This paper investigates the effectiveness of variable-grained and dynamic work generation strategies for parallel SUDA 2. These methods restrict the number of sub-tasks to be generated, based on the criterion of probable <b>work</b> <b>size.</b> The further we descend in the search recursion tree, the smaller the tasks become, thus we only select the largest tasks at each level of recursion as being suitable for scheduling. The revised algorithm runs approximately twice as fast as the existing parallel SUDA 2 for finer levels of granularity when variable-grained work generation is applied. The dynamic method, performing level-wise task selection based on size, outperforms the other techniques investigated. I...|$|E

40|$|As an {{interesting}} surface plasmon phenomenon discovered several years ago, electromagnetic field redistribution in nanoparticle dimer on film system provides a novel thought {{to enhance the}} light power on a plain film which could been widely used in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), solar cells, photo-catalysis, etc. Homodimers on film are mainly investigated in past years, while the properties of heterodimers on film are still unclear. In this <b>work,</b> <b>size</b> difference induced electromagnetic field redistribution in Ag nanoparticle dimer on Au film system is investigated first. The results obtained from finite element method indicate that the smaller nanoparticle has much greater ability to focus light energy on Au film, which even reached more than 5 time compared to the larger one. Further researches indicate that this energy focusing ability has a strong relationship to the wavelength and diameter ration in dimer. Similar focusing phenomenon {{is found in the}} system of thick wire-smaller particle on film. Later, the SERS spectra collected in the small nanoparticle-large nanowire system provide an experimental evidence for this theoretic predication.

40|$|What we now {{understand}} as rational and logical in today's world provides a mental scheme to take action, {{based on a}} framework of premises and values. These rules aim to maximize the utility of consequences, despite of any subjective value. Weber (Economy and Society, 1978) classified this scheme as an “instrumental rationality“, characterized by being guided by the goals, means, and consequence of the action. On the other hand, he also defined “substantive rationality“, postulated on {{the values of the}} subject, and not guided by any consequences of action. This study acknowledges that NGOs (non-governmental organizations) must belong to a field other than that of economic businesses, because they are based on different rationalities, especially when they encompass the observation in organizations that work for social transformation. A field study was made with five nonprofit organizations whose stated goals were social transformation, seeking to identify influences that the adoption of instrumental rationality imposes on accomplishing the expected objectives for these organizations.
