5|$|In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Senate of Central Albania (established by the rebelling towns in mid and north Albania) to return to Albania to take control. His first task was to provide financial backing for his government. Therefore, he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Pašić signed a secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September17. In October1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior and Durrës {{at the beginning of}} October, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|E
5|$|King William, {{using the}} {{treatment}} of Bishop John as a cause for war with Harald, brought a large army north in 12011202. The army, it is said, was so large that Harald capitulated <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> and agreed to give {{a quarter of the}} revenues of Caithness to William. During this time, Earl Harald's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots. Whether in revenge for {{the treatment of}} Bishop John, or to cow Harald, or because Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother (the lady of Moray), he was blinded and castrated, dying soon later in prison.|$|E

5|$|Located {{south of}} Sopron, {{the small town}} of Kőszeg was only {{a few miles from the}} Austrian border. It was held by a task force {{commanded}} by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Jurišić. Kőszeg was not considered a place of importance. It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha, did not realize how poorly defended Kőszeg was. After taking a few minor places, Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards, when the siege had already started.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir Robert Pye with Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blake as {{his second}} in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> and {{surrounded}} the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered and retreated to Bridgwater. Pye left Taunton {{shortly after the}} capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged with trying to blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex's campaign in Devon and Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War {{between the}} {{supporters}} of Charles I and Parliament, Weymouth was predominantly Parliamentarian in loyalty and the surrounding forts were held by their garrisons. Robert Dormer, the Earl of Carnarvon, entered Dorset with an army in 1643 and Weymouth surrendered, resulting in Sandsfoot Castle being controlled by the Royalists between August 1643 and June 1644. During this period the castle {{may have been used}} as a Royalist mint. Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, then retook the county for Parliament; Colonel William Ashburnham, the Royalist governor of Weymouth, retreated to Portland Castle <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> Devereux approached Sandsfoot and, after three hours of negotiations, the fort surrendered to him. In 1647, Parliament ordered the garrison at the castle to be demobilised but this did not occur, and John Hayne was appointed as its new captain.|$|E

5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed {{to take back the}} castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to mop up the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As a result of this process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{annexation}} by Persia, Egypt {{was joined}} with Cyprus and Phoenicia (modern Lebanon) {{in the sixth}} satrapy of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, {{also known as the}} Twenty-seventh dynasty, ended after more than one-hundred years in 402BC, and from 380 to 343BC the Thirtieth Dynasty ruled as the last native royal house of dynastic Egypt, which ended with the kingship of Nectanebo II. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-first Dynasty, began in 343BC, but shortly after, in 332BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further to the south, near Rakowiec, lay a {{group of}} forts of the outer line. All had already been {{abandoned}} by the Poles in early September, and were captured by Russian infantry under General Muraviev <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> Forces under General von Strandmann captured Szopy and started attacking Forts 44, 45 and the fortifications around Królikarnia. Although von Strandmann's unit {{did not have a}} clear numerical superiority (2,900 Russians with six guns against 1,700 Poles with six guns), they quickly pushed back the Polish defenders. Soon dense black powder smoke covered the battlefield. Unable to determine the direction of Russian attacks, the Polish commanders believed that the aim of the main thrust would be delivered against the positions at Królikarnia.|$|E
5000|$|Henry {{returned}} to the Langudeoc in 1181 and led a military attack on Roger's town of Lavaur, which Roger's wife Adelaide immediately surrendered to him <b>without</b> giving <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> Henry {{then went on to}} depose Pons d'Arsac from his see for being [...] "useless and reprehensible."

5|$|In 1918, as World War I was ending, the Royal Air Force {{built an}} {{airfield}} for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> The Syrian Emirate's army entered Deir ez-Zor on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak {{became part of}} Syria. In 1919, as the British and French argued over {{the borders of the}} planned mandates, the British permanent military representative to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate. However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 535, Bessas was {{appointed}} {{as one of}} Belisarius' lieutenants (along with Constantine and Peranius) in the expedition against the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy. He accompanied Belisarius {{in the early stages}} of the campaign, from the recovery of Sicily to the siege of Naples, and was present at the latter's fall in November 536. From there the Byzantine army advanced on Rome, which it captured <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b> Belisarius sent Constantine and Bessas to capture various outlying towns, but when he learned that the new Gothic king, Witiges, was marching on Rome, he recalled them. Bessas tarried for a while near the town of Narni, which controlled the direct route from the Gothic capital, Ravenna, over the Apennines to Rome, and there met and defeated the Gothic vanguard in a skirmish.|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers {{surrendered to the}} King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the King's castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, the earl {{was found guilty of}} treason and beheaded.|$|E
25|$|Dharmapala was {{succeeded by}} his son Devapala, who is {{regarded}} as the most powerful Pala ruler. His expeditions resulted in the invasion of Pragjyotisha (present-day Assam) where the king submitted <b>without</b> giving <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> and the Utkala (present-day Orissa) whose king fled from his capital city. The inscriptions of his successors also claim several other territorial conquests by him, but these are highly exaggerated (see the Geography section below).|$|R
50|$|Barnsley lasted {{just one}} {{season in the}} Premier League but did not go down <b>without</b> <b>a</b> brave <b>fight,</b> and they did reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, famously {{defeating}} Manchester United in the fifth round.

50|$|The series ended <b>without</b> <b>a</b> single <b>fight</b> in {{the final}} episode, but rather Watta's {{elementary}} school graduation ceremony.

5|$|In October, Edmund {{was once}} more {{employed}} {{in a move}} against Badlesmere, when he {{took part in a}} siege on Leeds Castle in Kent, which was held by Badlesmere. After Badlesmere was forced to surrender, hostilities moved to the Welsh Marches, where Roger Mortimer and others were in open revolt. Once confronted with the royal army, Mortimer surrendered <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> and attention turned to the leader of the baronial opposition, Thomas of Lancaster. Edmund, who had taken part in the Marcher campaign, was now ordered, with the Earl of Surrey, to take Lancaster's castle of Pontefract. On 17 March 1322, Lancaster was captured after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and brought to Pontefract. Here, Edmund was on the jury that condemned him to death for treason.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{force had}} {{been caught in the}} same {{hurricane}} that had dispersed Willaumez, and as a result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August, one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez's squadron in the United States and the others limping back to France. Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently, including Régulus, which arrived at Brest on 5 October, but one ship was less successful: on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French casualty of the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis' squadron. Closed in from all sides, the approach of Louis' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|E
