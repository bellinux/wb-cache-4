5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling.

5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E
5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E

When Knight was one year old, she contracted an illness, diagnosed at age three, and {{which resulted in}} the loss of most of her vision by the age of six. She joined the Great Britain paralympic skiing team in 2012, and progressed to compete at international-level events. Knight was the flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony, her debut Paralympics, in Sochi <b>where,</b> <b>at</b> the age of 15, she was the youngest person ever to compete for ParalympicsGB at the Winter Paralympic games.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Tropical Storm Bret {{left over}} 11,000people homeless, {{including}} 6,000 in Barinas state, and 3,500 in Caracas. Bret left US$25million in damage and caused 173deaths in the country, while at least 500 were injured. Most {{of the deceased}} were living in poorly built homes around Caracas, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least 120people were killed, mainly children. The storm was the deadliest natural disaster in Venezuela since the 1967 Caracas earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} Hugh de Puiset {{the bishop of}} Durham, who {{he went on to}} serve later in life, Blois {{probably}} came from Blois in France. His relationship with Puiset reinforces the likelihood of his origins being in Blois, as Puiset was a nephew of King Stephen of England and Stephen's brother Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, both of whom came from Blois. Nothing else is known of Blois' origins. He was titled magister, implying that he attended a university and was well-educated. He taught at the school of Paris for a while, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> one point a townswoman tried to seduce him, resulting in the medieval writer Gerald of Wales later recounting the humorous story of how Blois resisted the lady's advances.|$|E

5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Tensions run {{high among}} the band members, as Joey begins seducing Imelda, Natalie and Bernie, and Deco grows {{increasingly}} obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue <b>where,</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his hi-hat cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear of going to jail if he beats up Deco—much to Jimmy's frustration—and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a roller disco, Jimmy is confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.|$|E

5|$|The areas NY3 {{passes through}} {{alternate}} between {{long stretches of}} rural area, consisting of a mix of open terrain and dispersed residences, and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses. NY3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road, the major exception being the section that is concurrent with NY812, which is a principal arterial road. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> {{least part of the}} road is city-maintained. In Watertown, NY3 is locally maintained from Massey Street (southbound US11 junction) {{to the end of the}} NY3/NY12 overlap. The route is entirely city-maintained in Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} were most severe on the Florida East Coast Railway, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least 135 people died, 104 of them on Houseboat No. 4, one of the railway's boats. Many of the workers were swept to sea on barges and flatboats; however, the steamer Jenny rescued 42 workers, who were dropped off at Key West, while another 24 were sent to Savannah, Georgia. The railway's losses totaled about $200,000. Construction was disrupted {{for a whole year}} by the storm, as equipment was reassembled and repaired. Many farmers on the Florida Keys suffered large losses; orange groves and fields of pineapples were devastated by the storm. Six lives were lost on plantations in the Keys. At the government wharf, the Fessenden was damaged during the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{source of}} the river is in the Mourne Mountains {{on the slopes of}} Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly {{direction}} into Fofanny Dam. It continues its flow in a north-easterly direction into Tollymore Forest Park where the tributaries Spinkwee and Trassey rivers join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward Newcastle <b>where</b> <b>at</b> one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the mouth, as it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have made it an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI).|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Abe killed 108–195people {{after it}} caused {{flooding}} and landslides in the Philippines and Taiwan, ravaged coastal areas of China, and brought high waves to Japan.

5|$|Unlike most WWE events, where {{rules and}} {{participants}} for matches {{were determined by}} WWE's creative staff, {{this was the first}} event <b>where</b> <b>at</b> least some part of each match was determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's official website. The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches. Various wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines leading to the matches taking place at this event. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events. The event featured wrestlers and other talent from the Raw brand– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its on-air talent to separate television brands.|$|E
