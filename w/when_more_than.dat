5|$|Every October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, {{which has}} also become UPLB's alumni homecoming. The celebration commemorates events in 1918, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of {{students}} and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the Philippine National Guard for service in France during World War I. The volunteers never saw action, as the Allied Forces signed an armistice with Germany during the same year, essentially ending the war.|$|E

5|$|From May2 to 8, 1999, a large tornado {{outbreak}} {{took place}} {{across much of}} the Central and parts of the Eastern United States, as well as southern Canada. During this week-long event, 152tornadoes touched down in these areas. The most dramatic events unfolded during the afternoon of May3 through {{the early morning hours of}} May4 <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half of these storms occurred. Oklahoma experienced its largest tornado outbreak on record, with 70confirmed. The most notable of these was the F5 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado which devastated Oklahoma City and suburban communities. The tornado killed 36people and injured 583others; losses amounted to $1billion, making it the first billion-dollar tornado in history. Overall, 50people lost their lives during the outbreak and damage amounted to $1.4billion.|$|E

5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one card is being detected {{at the same}} time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{university}} in June 1913, Wilkinson became a paid worker for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50,000 women marched {{from all over}} the country to a mass rally in Hyde Park, London. She began to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanics of politics and campaigning, and became an accomplished speaker, able to hold her own even in the most hostile public meetings.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium, like {{sodium and}} potassium, almost always has +1 {{oxidation}} state when dissolved in water, even in biological contexts. The human body tends to treat Rb+ ions {{as if they}} were potassium ions, and therefore concentrates rubidium in the body's intracellular fluid (i.e., inside cells). The ions are not particularly toxic; a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. The biological half-life of rubidium in humans measures 31–46days. Although a partial substitution of potassium by rubidium is possible, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50% of the potassium in the muscle tissue of rats was replaced with rubidium, the rats died.|$|E

No storms formed in June, though the season became active in July when five named storms developed, including Hurricane Daniel {{which was the}} second strongest storm of the season, as well as Tropical Storm Emilia. During August, Hurricanes Ioke and John formed, as well as four other storms. September was a relatively quiet month with two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane. Three storms developed in October including Hurricane Paul and two formed in November; this marked the second time on record, after 1961, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one tropical storm developed in the basin {{during the month of}} November.|$|E

5|$|The Reagan {{administration}} {{largely ignored}} the AIDS crisis, which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, {{the same year}} Reagan took office. AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were routinely denied. By {{the end of the}} first 12 months of the epidemic, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E

5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season, Tropical Storm Aletta, formed off the {{southwest}} coast of Mexico. After no storms formed in June, the season became active again in July when five named storms developed, including Hurricane Daniel, {{which was the}} second strongest storm of the season. Six storms formed during August, including Hurricane Ioke and Hurricane John. September was a relatively inactive month, producing only two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of}} the miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E
5|$|The old {{villages of}} Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield lay within the ancient parishes of Crawley and Ifield. Both of their 13th-century parish churches are still used for Anglican worship. Expansion of the borough's {{boundary}} has brought more churches into Crawley, including the early 11th-century church at Worth—formerly an isolated Wealden village at {{the centre of}} its own large parish. Ifield was a centre of Nonconformism in the 17thcentury: its Friends Meeting House was built in 1676, <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 25% of the village's residents were Dissenters.|$|E

The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained {{for about half}} an hour and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} may fly from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and {{the flag of the}} guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the same height and of equal size. <b>When</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low level of activity, but a primary characteristic of the activity {{is that there are}} multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning in the north and ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep (in the northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese Deep (in the southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} dropped over 1inch (25mm) {{of precipitation}} {{across much of}} the Dominican Republic; Santo Domingo reported a peak total of 3.9in (98mm). The rainfall led to flooding, primarily east and west of the capital city, while five rivers overflowed their banks. Several roads were inundated, obstructing traffic. The flooding collapsed a sports center and a house, injuring two people inside. Further inland, 160people had to be evacuated <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100houses were flooded. Crop damage was also reported. In Pedernales, gusty winds uprooted trees, several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town. The rainfall was welcomed in the country, as conditions were dry in the preceding months. Light flooding also occurred in eastern Jamaica, though damage there, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|While the {{brothers}} played together for Fitzroy {{on a regular}} basis, they only played first-class cricket together occasionally, mainly {{due to a lack}} of form and differences in age. Merv debuted for Victoria before the war, and Neil joined him in 1946-47. Ray followed in subsequent season, and the trio played in two matches together for their state. However, there were no occasions after this <b>when</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two played together in the same match and such occurrences became more sporadic after this as Merv was dropped, while Neil was often away playing for Australia. Mick made his debut in 1948-49, but left Victoria at the end of the season after being unable to hold his position in the team, while Ray often struggled to gain regular selection except when Neil and the other Test players were representing Australia. Ray had a strong end to the 1952-53 season and was selected for all the matches in the following two seasons alongside Neil, but was then dropped.|$|E
5|$|Wotton {{station was}} {{situated}} in open countryside, about one mile (1.6km) {{from the nearest}} settlement of Wotton Underwood, which in 1871 had a population of around 220. Roughly halfway between the line's terminus at Brill and the junction with the main line at Quainton Road, the station marked the official midpoint of the line for operating purposes. <b>When</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one locomotive was in operation on the line, the Tramway operated a token signalling system using colour-coded staffs; drivers on the section between Quainton Road and Wotton were obliged to carry a blue staff; those between Wotton and Brill (and the Kingswood siding) a red staff. The station was situated on a sharp curve; had the extension to Oxford been built, the station would have needed to have been resited to accommodate longer and faster trains.|$|E
