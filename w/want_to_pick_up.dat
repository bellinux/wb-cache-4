500|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the CD release of Memory Almost Full incorporated a cover insert whose top-right corner was intentionally folded down {{to the center of the}} insert, leaving the CD tray visible. The folded-down white corner covers up the corner of the armchair image, but has the artist and album names printed so that the text is complete despite the fold. Upon opening and flattening out the cover insert, the armchair is complete, but the portion of the text which is printed on the folded-down corner is not printed on the front of the cover, leaving the text incomplete. This was the first time such an artistic intervention occurred within a standard jewel-case, and at first glance had the possibility of being viewed as a mis-manufactured copy. McCartney on the CD case/album artwork: [...] "I really wanted to make the CD a desirable object. [...] Something that I know I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from the shelf, something that would make people curious." ...|$|E

He stood looking at them while {{he raised his hand}} to his head, behind, and rubbed it with a movement that displaced his hat. (I may remark in parenthesis that I never saw a hat more easily displaced than Mr. Ruck’s.) I supposed him about to exhale some plaint, but I was mistaken. Mr. Ruck was unhappy, but he was a touching fatalist. “Well, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> something,” he contented himself with recognising. “That’s the principal interest for ladies.” ...|$|E

5000|$|During this time, Dovetail Joint {{amicably}} parted {{ways with}} Roger Jansen and KMA, leaving the band without management {{and in a}} showdown with their label. Columbia/Aware had {{to decide whether or}} not they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the bands contract option. They pushed back the deadline twice. Frustrated, in February 2000, the band said, [...] "Sign us or let us go!" [...] With perceived reluctance, Columbia/Aware <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the bands 1st option.|$|R

It gets one off {{of all sorts}} of disagreeable routine work, and as you know {{something}} about it to begin with, I have no doubt that you will soon pick up your work. A {{lot of the things that}} one has to learn when one first joins are not of much use afterwards, and may not have to be done once a year. However, I can lend you books, and if you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> all the words of command you can study them when you have nothing else to do; and I can tell you there are plenty of times when one is rather glad to have something to amuse one; when one is running with a light wind aft, like this, for instance, we may go on for days without having to touch a sail. Well, we will begin at once. We won't go aloft till you have got your togs; a fellow going aloft in landsmen's clothes always looks rather a duffer.

5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow noted [...] "Since {{this was not}} one of Pepper's strongest groups, the LP is not essential, but fans of the unique altoist will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> these {{interesting}} performances".|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 3 stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating, [...] "Not one of McPherson's most {{essential}} releases, as {{the material and}} arrangements are just not that strong; nevertheless, the altoist still plays well, and his fans will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> this reissue".|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Whedon and 20th Century Fox {{started the}} {{development}} of Buffy the Animated Series, an animated spin-off of Whedon's popular TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Whedon and Jeph Loeb were to produce the show while many actor of the original series were attached to reprise their roles. It was initially planned to be aired in Fox Kids, possibly as early in February 2002. However, Fox Kids ceased its operations in September 2002, and no network <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the series, {{which resulted in the}} abandonment of this project.|$|R
50|$|Mirror {{movements}} {{are characterized by}} involuntary movements {{on one side of}} the body mirroring voluntary movements on the other. For example, if someone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a pencil with their left hand, then their right hand would also reach out for the same pencil. This mostly affects the top half of the body but can also affect the bottom half. Walking may become more difficult, as one leg will move at the same time as the other. Playing a musical instrument such as the piano may become very difficult, as the process involves doing different things with each hand.|$|R
5000|$|David Noonan {{explains}} the designers' approach to preparing {{material for the}} book: [...] "In each section, we first decided what we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from previous D&D sources such as Defenders of the Faith and Faiths and Pantheons. That meant a lot of meetings {{and a lot of}} feedback from the fans. Then, especially for the spells, we looked for niches we hadn't filled yet. For example, there's a lot of design space left for high-level druid and cleric spells, so we tilted the balance of the spell list a little toward the upper levels." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "This {{one is a}} bit unusual since the trumpeter is {{accompanied}} by David Friedman (on vibes and marimba), bassist Buster Williams and drummer Joe Chambers. The music is somewhat challenging and it inspires Baker {{to come up with}} some lyrical statements. There are many Chet Baker recordings from his final decade and his true fans will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> this one".|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, Damian Kindler <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tie up loose ends from the cliffhanger, and to settle the series into a [...] "new groove." [...] He {{considered}} two beginnings. One would start with the action, and the second would be the Cabal explaining their plans. Thinking the latter was too uninteresting, the former was chosen. Kindler also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the story line six weeks after [...] "Revelations", since that was considered a good time to start. So the opening joined right in the middle of the hunt for Ashley. In the script, Emilie Ullerup had only one line of dialogue, though pivotal to the plot.|$|R
50|$|A new film, Return to Sleepaway Camp, was {{completed}} in 2003 and initially struggled to complete visual effects. It was directed by Robert Hiltzik, {{the director of the}} original 1983 film. He decided that this chapter will ignore the story lines of the previous sequels, stating that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> from where the original film ended. According to Fangoria.com the digital effects were redone from 2006 to 2008. The film found distribution, and was released November 4, 2008, by Magnolia/Magnet Pictures. Review copies of the film had been sent out, and the movie's screener had already been leaked prior to the release, ruining the surprise ending.|$|R
50|$|James Ratner {{recognizes that}} there are {{substantial}} problems in administering the essential facilities doctrine, but he argues that addressing denials of access to essential facilities is socially necessary: If a facility is essential, the market in which it produces has become like a dead mouse on the kitchen floor. No one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the mouse, and doing so may be repulsive to some, but it is probably best not to leave it there. Finding a facility to be essential means that the competitive process is an unreliable mechanism for correcting significant short-run welfare losses. The market requires some form of intervention, or those losses will persist.|$|R

[...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> Dracula the Un-dead, pick it up for an {{interesting}} take on the 'happily-never-after.'

5000|$|The {{idea for}} a new Vampire Hunter D film came after there was a fan demand to make a {{follow-up}} to Vampire Hunter D (1985).

Plans for a new film started in 1997 by director Yoshiaki Kawajiri and production company Madhouse. Producer Mataichiro Yamamoto <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the rights <b>to</b> Madhouse's Wicked City.

[...] "It was the best produced, had the most complex songwriting; it's the most {{progressive}} reggae that's been made. Steel Pulse, Aswad, Reggae Regular, Misty in Roots, Mikey Dread, Dennis Bovell and Linton Kwesi Johnson were doing groundbreaking stuff. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> where those artists left off. Of course, we don't come close to what those artists did, but I think that's where the idea comes from—that reggae can take other forms.
