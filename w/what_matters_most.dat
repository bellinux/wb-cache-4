25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E
500|$|Commercially unsuccessful, Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments is Streisand's lowest-selling album {{released}} by Columbia {{and one of}} four studio albums {{that have not been}} certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (the other three being 1969's What About Today?, 2011's <b>What</b> <b>Matters</b> <b>Most,</b> and 2016's [...] ). In the United States, the album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 146 for the week ending November 24, 1973. Within two weeks it rose 71 places to number 75, before reaching its peak position at number 64 on December 22. It spent a total of sixteen consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200. Paul Grein, writer of the [...] "Chart Beat" [...] column for Billboard, noted that Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments was one of Streisand's few releases to miss peaking within the top 15 of the chart. Meanwhile, the record entered Canada's chart (compiled by RPM) at number 81 on January 1, 1974. However, it dropped to number 88 the following week and on February 2, 1974, it peaked at number 80, which was also the final publication that the album would appear on, totaling four weeks altogether.|$|E
500|$|Judaism arguably {{does not}} require uncompromising {{obedience}} to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should [...] "square their actions by the square of conscience", learn to [...] "circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind." [...] The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience {{as one of the}} comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when we suspect that <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> in life ("being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877â€“1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).|$|E

2500|$|Allen Shawn {{has noted}} that, given Schoenberg's living [...] circumstances, {{his work is}} usually defended rather than listened to, {{and that it is}} {{difficult}} to experience it apart from the ideology that surrounds it [...] Richard Taruskin asserts that Schoenberg committed what he terms a [...] "poietic fallacy", the conviction that <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> (or all that matters) in a work of art is the making of it, the maker's input, and that the listener's pleasure must not be the composer's primary objective [...] Taruskin also criticizes the ideas of measuring Schoenberg's value as a composer in terms of his influence on other artists, the overrating of technical innovation, and the restriction of criticism to matters of structure and craft while derogating other approaches as vulgarian [...]|$|E
2500|$|At {{independence}} {{and after the}} independence of India, India has maintained such central British institutions as parliamentary government, one-person, one-vote {{and the rule of}} law through nonpartisan courts. It retained as well the institutional arrangements of the Raj such as district administration, universities and stock exchanges. One major change was the rejection of separate princely states. Metcalf shows that over the course of two centuries, British intellectuals and Indian specialists made the highest priority bringing peace, unity and good government to India. They offered many competing methods to reach the goal. [...] For example, Cornwallis recommended turning Bengali Zamindar into the sort of English landlords that controlled local affairs in England. Munro proposed to deal directly with the peasants. Sir William Jones and the Orientalists promoted Sanskrit, while Macaulay promoted the English language. [...] Zinkin argues that in the long-run, <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> about the legacy of the Raj is the British political ideologies which the Indians took over after 1947, especially the belief in unity, democracy, the rule of law and a certain equality beyond caste and creed. Zinkin sees this not just in the Congress party but also among Hindu Nationalists in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which specifically emphasises Hindu traditions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to {{give the}} 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were {{broadcast}} and later published as A Discovery of Australia. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. [...] "Everything a historian writes," [...] he stated for example, [...] "should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside {{a man who knows}} all about that horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, a man who has looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, a sadness, and a compassion because <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> in life is never likely to happen". Clark's next work, In Search of Henry Lawson (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton's pioneering The Literature of Australia. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark's popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson's losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Professor Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as [...] "a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation".|$|E

2500|$|The staged {{premiere of}} Donnerstag {{was very well}} {{received}} in Italy, where it was awarded the Italian Music Critics' Prize for best new work in December 1981. The German press reception, on the other hand, was harsh and often ad hominem [...] The Covent Garden production in 1985 also provoked contrary points of view in the press, in part divided over {{the question of the}} music versus the theatrical conception. Paul Griffiths, writing in the Times, for example, found that [...] "it contains much quite extraordinary music" [...] but [...] "the opera never for a moment works as the mystic revelation it pretends to be. â€¦ It is very wondrous to contemplateâ€”wondrous, that is, when it is not just silly" [...] Andrew Porter, on the contrary, found the [...] "variety of forces, forms, textures, and matter â€¦ a strength and a pleasure", and the [...] "somewhat ramshackle construction saves the work from solemn pretentiousness. There's even a playful quality about much of it, although its essential seriousness is not in doubt and inner musical integrity is not compromised" [...] Porter concludes, hearing and seeing the drama is an engrossing, enjoyable, and elevating adventure. Ear, mind, and spirit are engaged. And, as I suggested, moments of jokiness, naÃ¯vetÃ©â€”silliness, evenâ€”save the work from being unbearably solemn: Stockhausen-Sarastro has a vein of Papageno in him. There is a great deal to listen to and to watch. Some of the spans, especially in the last scene, are traversed slowly. But things happen; the music doesn't fall into simplistic repetitions or numbing stasis. There are counterpoints to follow. There are supple melodies and rich harmonies. There are wonderful soundsâ€”new and stirring sounds. The score is a culmination of the marvellous musicsâ€”in whose making Michael's vision, Lucifer's technical skills, and the inspiration of Eve's love seem to have conspiredâ€”that have poured from Stockhausen during the last thirty years. â€¦ But <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>most</b> now is the excitement of entering this huge, ambitious work, responding to its sounds and sights, trying to understand it, and feeling, perhaps, that it isâ€”by intention at leastâ€”something like a Divine Comedy and a ComÃ©die Humaine in one.|$|E
