5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Gellibrand {{founded the}} Remembrance Club in Hobart, {{with the aim}} of {{encouraging}} returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to England. Savige used this opportunity to bring up the idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. Legacy Australia was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a charitable organisation focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26years, due to his commitment, energy and enthusiasm, Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{establishment}} of this church {{was the creation of}} a strong priesthood and to this end Afonso's son Henrique was sent to Europe to be educated. Henrique became an ordained priest and in 1518 was named as bishop of Utica (a North African diocese recently reclaimed from the Muslims). He returned to Kongo in the early 1520s to run Kongo's new church. He died in 1531 as he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Europe for the Council of Trent.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Thompson's {{most popular and}} acclaimed work appeared within the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Along with Joe Eszterhas and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding {{the focus of the}} magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin' Wolf to Lou Reed. Armed with early fax machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to press.|$|E
25|$|Ashby was busted for {{possession}} of marijuana while scouting locations in Canada. This almost changed the studio's mind about backing the project, but the director's drug bust was not widely reported and Nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him, which was a deciding factor. Just as the film <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into production, Crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow Crosse {{to deal with the}} news and decide if he still wanted to do the film. The actor decided not to do the film, and Ashby and Stalmaster scrambled to find a replacement. They cast Otis Young.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1941, O'Brien {{was given}} {{command of the}} 2/5th Field Regiment. Its commander, Lieutenant Colonel L. G. L. Ingate, had been invalided home, and the 7th Division <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into battle. The choice of {{replacements}} was limited to majors already in the Middle East, and the 7th Division Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), Brigadier Frank Berryman, selected O'Brien. This made him the youngest regimental commander in the Army at the time. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 5 March. The 2/5th had trained with the old 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers, and only received the new 25-pounders shortly before it moved to Mersa Matruh in April 1941.|$|E

25|$|A {{thorough}} {{investigation of the}} Luzhniki disaster corresponded with the new policies of Yuri Andropov, a former KGB head, who became {{the leader of the}} country just one month after the tragedy. He became known in the Soviet Union for his efforts to restore discipline {{at all levels of the}} society that had been loosened by the last years of Brezhnev's rule. On 17 December 1982, two months after the stampede, he even went as far as firing the interior minister Nikolai Shchelokov (Николай Щёлоков), the Soviet Union's top police officer, after learning of the corruption allegations against him. Shchelokov was later stripped of all state decorations, and committed suicide when he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to trial.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after he}} became Foreign Secretary, Cook ended his {{relationship}} with Margaret, revealing {{that he was having}} an extra-marital affair with one of his staff, Gaynor Regan. He announced his intentions to leave his wife via a press statement made at Heathrow on 2 August 1997. Cook was forced into a decision over his private life after a telephone conversation with Alastair Campbell as he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on holiday with his first wife. Campbell explained that the press was about to break the story of his affair with Regan. His estranged wife subsequently accused him of having had several extramarital affairs and alleged he had a habit of drinking heavily.|$|E
25|$|During {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} upon his {{exit from the}} treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{to work on a}} new Ed Wood film, The Ghoul Goes West. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including The Phantom Ghoul and Dr. Acula. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in Plan 9 from Outer Space, which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.|$|E

David Smith of The Guardian highlighted the pathos of the performance, writing that Laurie's performance as Lt.

500|$|The [...] "inconvenient journalist" [...] (giornalista scomodo) – as De Mauro {{had become}} known – was kidnapped and killed because the Mafia and their backers {{wanted to know}} his sources of {{confidential}} and potentially devastating information, public prosecutor Antonio Ingroia told the court in his closing speech in March 2011. [...] "The death sentence on De Mauro was passed because of a convergence of two elements," [...] Ingroia said. Riina, Bontade and Badalamenti decided to eliminate De Mauro because he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> public about Mattei's 1962 murder {{as a result of}} research for Francesco Rosi's landmark movie, as well as the fact the journalist had uncovered the plans for staging the Mafia-backed far-right Borghese coup d'état, thanks to his former wartime Fascist connections.|$|E

In an {{interview}} with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine revealed that he wrote the song the day his girlfriend moved away after they broke up. In another interview, Levine revealed that the song {{was written in the}} [...] "most emotionally trying time" [...] in his life. He also added, [...] "I was in a relationship that was ending, but I was really excited on the other end because the band <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> make the record and I was ecstatic to go in the studio. She was literally leaving town within days of me writing the lyrics to 'This Love', so I was in prime emotional condition to write a song with that kind of conflict." ...|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger that he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into.

[...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me and told me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
