25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. <b>We</b> <b>collected</b> an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1918, Hemingway {{responded to}} a Red Cross {{recruitment}} effort in Kansas City and signed on to become an ambulance driver in Italy. He left New York in May and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery. By June, {{he was at the}} Italian Front. It was probably around this time that he first met John Dos Passos, with whom he had a rocky relationship for decades. On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion, where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> fragments". A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{has strong}} autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway {{signed on as}} a member of the Red Cross at age 19, [...] and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an {{ambulance}} driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> fragments". A few days later, on July8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula—a trip that became the inspiration for [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed—leaving Nick alone in the woods.|$|E

6000|$|The weather {{continuing}} bad, {{and snow}} falling, the country {{people began to}} leave for their winter-quarters at Lamteng. In the evenings we enjoyed {{the company of the}} Phipun and Tchebu Lama, who relished a cup of sugarless tea more than any other refreshment we could offer. From them <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> much Tibetan information:--the former was an inveterate smoker, using a pale, mild tobacco, mixed largely with leaves of the small wild Tibetan Rhubarb, called [...] "Chula."

60|$|Mr. Saxton {{had some}} thirty sheep on the Common. George {{determined}} that the easiest thing was for him to sleep out with them.

60|$|My {{collection}} of specimens from the mines and the river-beds filled a dozen cases. The butterflies, of which <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> a large number, were all spoilt by the moth {{for want of}} camphor. 'Insect-powder' had been our only preservative. I had also a thirty-gallon cask of plants preserved in spirits, two boxes well stuffed, a large case of orchids, and a raceme of the bamboo-palm (Raphia vinifera), whose use has still to be found. The animals, including insects in tubes, filled nearly two kegs and three bottles, and I had two small cases of stuffed birds, the handiwork of Mr. Dawson.|$|E
60|$|Reaching the glade {{where the}} other two were tied up, <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> them also and {{returned}} to the house, where we arrived at five o'clock. As everything seemed quiet I put my mare into the stable, slipped its bit and gave it some forage. Then I went round the house, and to my great joy found Anscombe and Heda waiting anxiously, but with nothing to report, and with them Footsack. Very hastily I swallowed some food, while Footsack inspanned the horses. In {{a quarter of an hour}} all was ready. Then suddenly, in an inconsequent female fashion, Heda developed a dislike to leaving her father unburied.|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Washing line] We stayed {{two days}} at Streatley, and got our clothes washed. We had tried washing them ourselves, in the river, under George’s superintendence, {{and it had}} been a failure. Indeed, it had been more than a failure, because we were worse off after we had washed our clothes than we were before. Before we had washed them, they had been very, very dirty, it is true; but they were just wearable. After we had washed them—well, the river between Reading and Henley was much cleaner, after we had washed our clothes in it, than it was before. All the dirt {{contained}} in the river between Reading and Henley, <b>we</b> <b>collected,</b> during that wash, and worked it into our clothes.|$|E

60|$|Forthwith Captain Sam and I {{started out}} to catch soldier-crabs for bait. The {{directions}} {{we got from}} conch fishermen and others led us to assume {{that it would be}} an easy matter to find crabs. It was not! We had to go poking round mangrove roots until we learned how to catch the soldiers. If this had not been fun for me it would have been hard work. But ever since I was a little tad I have loved to chase things in the water. And upon this occasion it was with great satisfaction that I caught more bait than Captain Sam. Sam is something of a naturalist and he was always spending time over a curious bug or shell or object he found. Eventually <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> a bucketful of soldier-crabs.|$|E
60|$|Here all was unchanged. There was {{the little}} mount worn by his feet, on which Jana was wont to stand. There were the rocks behind which I had tried to hide, and near to them some crushed human bones which I knew to be those of the unfortunate Marût. These we buried with due reverence on {{the spot where he}} had fallen, I {{meanwhile}} thanking God that my own bones were not being interred at their side, as but for Hans would have been the case--if they were ever interred at all. All about lay the skeletons of dead elephants, and from among these <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> as much of the best ivory as we could carry, namely about fifty camel loads. Of course there was much more, but {{a great deal of the}} stuff had been exposed for so long to sun and weather that it was almost worthless.|$|E
60|$|Orchideae are, perhaps, {{the largest}} natural {{order in the}} Khasia, where fully 250 kinds grow, chiefly on trees and rocks, but many are terrestrial, inhabiting damp woods and grassy slopes. I doubt whether in {{any other part of}} the globe the species of orchids outnumber those of any other natural order, or form so large a {{proportion}} of the flora. Balsams are next in relative abundance (about twenty-five), both tropical and temperate kinds, of great beauty and variety in colour, form, and size of blossom. Palms amount to fourteen, of which the Chamaerops and Arenga are the only genera not found in Sikkim. Of bamboos there are also fifteen, and of other grasses 150, which is an immense proportion, considering that the Indian flora (including those of Ceylon, Kashmir, and all the Himalaya), hardly contains 400. Scitamineae also are abundant, and extremely beautiful; <b>we</b> <b>collected</b> thirty-seven kinds.|$|E
