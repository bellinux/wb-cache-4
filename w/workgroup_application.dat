In education organization, such as Engineering Faculty of Diponegoro University, one of many activities {{that needs to be}} supported by application is about to share idea and discussion between people who collaborates in there. To support this kind of activity, web based application is one solution that can be build considering of the raise of Web 2. 0 technology which enable people to interact each other and shares many kind of digital resources. Developed using CodeIgniter Framework, this application will also support sending broadcast information via email and short message service (SMS).

40|$|The goal of {{workgroup}} computing {{is to help}} {{individuals and}} groups efficiently perform {{a wide range of}} functions on networked computer systems (Ellis, Gibbs, 2 ̆ 6 Rein, 1991). Early workgroup computing tools were designed for limited functionality and group interaction (Craighill, 1992). Current workgroup computing applications do not allow enough control of group processes and they provide little correlation between various workgroup computing application areas (Rodden and Blair, 1991). An integrated common architecture may produce more effective workgroup computing applications. Integrating common support functions into a common framework will avoid duplication of these functions for each workgroup computing application (Pastor 2 ̆ 6 Jager, 1992). Over 50 research and commercial workgroup computing applications were analyzed to understand and discover their distinctive characteristics and fundamental structure. Using the specified methods, a detailed section of a workgroup computing taxonomy was synthesized for each of 11 workgroup computing functional areas. The detailed taxonomy was the consolidation of all the hierarchical structures. The taxonomy formed the basis for developing an integrated workgroup computing architecture and a set of workgroup computing Application Programming Interface (API) specifications. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the available workgroup computing literature and application documentation would provide sufficient information to develop a comprehensive workgroup computing taxonomy. By comparing workgroup tasks with workgroup computing functional areas, it was possible to derive a common set of workgroup computing management and support tasks that were based on the detailed workgroup computing taxonomy. Common workgroup computing management and support tasks formed the basis for a 1 ! Integrated workgroup computing architecture. Finally, 86 new API specifications were written for common workgroup computing management and support functions. This study can be used by <b>workgroup</b> <b>application</b> developers to determine which common workgroup computing functions should be integrated into future workgroup applications. Implementing {{the results of this study}} in future workgroup computing systems will lead to flexible and integrated systems that are easier to use and more transparent to workgroup members. Workgroup computing researchers can use this study to identify workgroup computing functions that should be included in their research areas...|$|E

The conclusions suggest that research should focus on the nature and processes of "epistemic" communities (collective efforts organized to pursue common goals that are governed by procedural authority) to better understand how codification work...|$|R

40|$|Individuals in a {{business}} usually do not work entirely alone, but instead in teams, committees, departments, {{and other types of}} workgroups. To collaborate on common tasks, workgroup members can have meetings, talk on the telephone, send faxes, and distribute memos. Group members can also use workgroup information systems to help them collaborate. This type of system is also called a group support system because it supports the work of people in a group. This article looks at <b>applications</b> used in <b>workgroup</b> information systems, and shows how these applications affect group collaboration in businesses. First, we explain how workgroup information systems encourage group collaboration. Then we examine the characteristics of group collaboration and describe common <b>workgroup</b> <b>applications</b> and the software used for these applications, and finally we discuss about office automation and the virtual work environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a workflow management system to support mobile GIS <b>workgroup</b> <b>applications</b> and highlights the design of the workflow definition language the system offers. The system features a hierarchical execution model in which each instance is able to delegate the execution of sub-workflows to other active instances. It incorporates instance discovery and event handling services, that enhance the proper treatment of disconnections, and adopts an optimist replication strategy to handle workflow context variables. The workflow definition language features special constructors that improve the legibility of large workflow definitions. The results reported here build on the experience accumulated with the implementation and deployment of an emergency management application that offers action plans, easy access to geographic data and tight control over the resources allocated to face an emergency. 1...|$|R
40|$|One of today's most {{challenging}} problems in office automation is {{the integration of}} Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) into legacy systems and their combination with other cooperative applications. For the integration of legacy systems the WFMS provides the central "control flow component" which calls a program to be executed in order to process single atomic activities - {{from the point of}} view of the WFMS - and waits for their termination. This is disadvantageous if the called application is complex and longlasting, because its inner states cannot be used to control the calling workflow. <b>Workgroup</b> <b>applications</b> such as group decision support systems (GDSS) do often have these properties. This paper discusses problems of the tight integration of non-workflow sessions into workflows and proposes a solution using an event based approach. 1. Introduction In the recent years the development and use of Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) has found its way from academia to corpora [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The model {{developed}} {{in this article}} explains differences in the division of labour across firms {{as a result of}} computer technology adoption. Changes in the division of labour result from reduced production time and improved communication possibilities. The first shifts the divi-sion of labour towards generic structures, while the latter enhances specialisation. Our estim-ates for a sample of Dutch establishments in the period 1990 – 6 suggest that productivity gains have been the main determinant for shifts in the division of labour. These productivity gains induced skill upgrading, while in firms gaining from improved communication possibilities specialisation increased and skill requirements have fallen. The rapid spread of computer technology has led to substantial changes in the division of labour and a shift in the demand for labour in favour of skilled workers. Mostly these changes have been accompanied by flatter organisational structures, larger autonomy for workers or <b>workgroups,</b> the <b>application</b> of innovative human resource management practices and so on. There are also less typical examples where computerisation is associated with increased specialisation (e. g., the rapid increase of call-centres), scripting of communication with clients and stricte...|$|R
40|$|<b>Workgroup</b> {{multimedia}} <b>applications</b> such as videoconference, teleteaching or CSCW demand {{multipoint service}} from Telecommunication Networks. This {{is not just}} a broadcast service but it is a service where N sites transmit traffic to N sites. This service requires that the network support a large number of work-groups with few (5 - 20) participants together with low delay, low delay jitter, high throughput and a con-nection-less service in a wide area. The service of required by each of these workgroups is what we call Virtual LAN-WAN (VLW). At present, most of these multimedia applications have been developed over the IP protocol. Asynchro-nous Transfer Mode (ATM) will be the technology of the future Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN), so ATM Networks must provide a framework for the development of multimedia applications based on IP protocols. In fact, the integration of IP over ATM Networks is as subject of intense work in standardization bodies. Within this effort, the ATM Forum and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have achieved some results in the provision of LAN service based on IP over ATM. This paper shows the problems of supporting a VLW service based on IP protocol over ATM Networks. We summarize the ATM Forum model based on LAN Emulation Specification (LANE) and the work in progress of the IETF on this subject. Pros and cons of every solution are described, and a model consid-ered to provide cost-effective performance is proposed. Finally, we present a case study that has been tested in a European scale. This case study is a distributed conference based on the ATM paneuropean pilot interconnecting ten sites in seven countries.
