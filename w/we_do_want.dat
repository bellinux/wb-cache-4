If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> it to succeed, we should surely put behind it the full force of our influence. If we want to cut it short and prevent its development to a political authority which might eventually become a federal state, it would surely be better for us not to wish it success". [...] The Foreign Office replied that European integration would never succeed.|$|E

Although he wasn't exactly sure what shape it will take, Erna told Launch Radio Networks that [...] "I've been putting some thought into it," [...] he said. [...] "I actually have some stuff that I'm doing on the side right now. I don't know when I'm gonna kind of unleash something like that, and I don't know really what it's gonna be yet. I {{have a couple of}} different ideas, and I'm not sure what and when it's gonna happen, but of course Godsmack is our lifeblood and we don't have any plans on trying to break this thing up.

2500|$|In 1955 Cradock {{recorded}} a pilot for what became {{a very successful}} BBC television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving {{a detailed account of}} every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, [...] "You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now." [...] Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included [...] "This won't break you", [...] "This is perfectly economical", and [...] "This won't stretch your purse". When presenting her Christmas cake recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying [...] "But on the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> one piece of decent cake in the year." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "This Little Light" [...] {{is based}} around [...] "This Little Light of Mine", a gospel song written by American {{composer}} Harry Loes {{in the early}} 20th century. It first appeared on LZ7's EP Gasoline, which was released in the UK in August 2008. It was then remixed in 2010 for inclusion as track one on the band's second studio album, Light, and {{was used as a}} theme song for both The Message Trust's charitable initiative Shine Your Light and the UK government's Shine Week 2010. LZ7 launched the 2010 remix at a gig at the Manchester Apollo, before promoting the track at summer festivals and an eight-date schools tour around Manchester. The band encouraged people to make a note of the release date and to download the single, with Lindz West, LZ7's frontman, remarking: [...] "What we don't want is anyone phoning up stations and saying 'Why aren't you playing this song?', because that just creates a bad name for us in the first place. What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> is people buying it and getting it to the position where it has to go on the radio airplay lists and the stations have to play it." ...|$|E
