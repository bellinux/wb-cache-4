50|$|<b>Where</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>Are</b> We And What Day Is It... This Is Static-X is a rockumentary DVD {{that was}} set to be {{released}} in 2001 by industrial metal band Static-X. It features behind-the-scenes and live footage, along with all of Static-Xs music videos (at the time) and an audio-only concert. Due to the live footage being recorded at Ozzfest, Sharon Osbourne threatened to sue the band if the DVD was released. Therefore, it was prevented from ever hitting store shelves. It is very hard to find and roughly only 500 copies are in existence.|$|E

40|$|May 2005 {{marked the}} 60 th Anniversary {{of the end}} of the Second World War in Europe. A large number of Canadian {{veterans}} travelled to Holland to mark the occasion, remember the good times and honour their comrades who never made it home.

5000|$|I {{never thought}} that Take the Skinheads Bowling would become a Hit. If someone had {{traveled}} from the future and told me {{we would have a}} hit on our first album I would not have picked this song as being the hit. Not in a million years. I would have more likely picked <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> Bill.Why? We regarded Take The Skinheads Bowling as just a weird non-sensical song. The lyrics were purposely structured so that it would be devoid of meaning. Each subsequent line would undermine any sort of meaning established by the last line. It was the early 80′s and all our peers were writing songs that were full of meaning. It was our way of rebelling. BTW {{this is the most important}} fact about this song. We wanted the words to lack any coherent meaning. There is no story or deeper insight that I can give you about this song.Lassie and <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> Bill were silly but there was at least a point to the songs. Plus both songs were pretty jokey. Something that seemed popular at the time. David Lowery ...|$|R
