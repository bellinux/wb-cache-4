5000|$|Both rams and ewes {{are polled}} and the breed have half-long or {{variable}} length tails. The wool {{of the sheep}} is uniform with mean fibre diameter of 32.3 micrometres and 2 - 3 kg greasy fleece weight. The wool was traditionally used for handicrafts and the pelts were used for <b>woolskin</b> rugs. [...] The adult live weight of ewes is between 70 and 80 kg. The mean litter size is 1.8 lambs born per year. Lambs are generally slaughtered at 6 months age (30 to 40 kg live weight).|$|E
40|$|Poll Dorset x Romney lambs {{were chosen}} {{from a group}} of 300 on the basis of {{measured}} diameter and bulk. The selected lambs made up four groups of twenty, that had the four possible combinations of low (LD) or high diameter (HD) (29 or 32 Âµm), and low (LB) or high bulk (HB) (22 or 26 cm 3 /g). Pelts were recovered at slaughter, assessed for <b>woolskin</b> tanning, processed to dyed crust leather and scored for the grain surface defect known as pinhole (1 to 5, best to worst). Suitability for woolskins was greatest for the high bul...|$|E
40|$|Glutaraldehyde-tanned <b>woolskin</b> pads {{which are}} used for the {{prevention}} of decubitus ulcers in bed patients were experimentally contaminated with polio or vaccinia viruses. Two methods of exposure, direct contact and aerosol, were used in separate experiments. Attempts were made to remove or inactivate these virus contaminants by laundering the woolskins in a quaternary ammonium disinfectant, a phenolic disinfectant, or alkalinized glutaraldehyde, in combination with an anionic detergent or a nonionic detergent. The effect of a commercial detergent-sanitizer was also studied. The virus titers were significantly reduced in all experiments, but only laundering in glutaraldehyde in combination with either detergent lowered the vaccinia virus titers to below detectable limits. High concentrations of glutaraldehyde altered the texture of the wool and leather apparently by precipitating a component of the detergent onto the fibers. In all the poliovirus experiments, the virus was still detectable on either or both the wool and the leather of the pads after laundering. The rinse water from each experiment was tested for the presence of virus. No vaccinia virus was recovered, but poliovirus was demonstrated in titers up to 103 cell culture 50 % infectious doses...|$|E
40|$|Glutaraldehyde-tanned <b>woolskins</b> {{which are}} used as bedpads to prevent decubitus ulcers were {{contaminated}} with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442). Two methods of exposure, direct contact and aerosol, were used in separate experiments. Attempts were made to decrease the bacterial population placed on the <b>woolskins</b> by laundering them in a quaternary ammonium disinfectant, a phenolic disinfectant, or alkalinized glutaraldehyde, in combination with an anionic or nonionic detergent. The effect of a commercial detergent-sanitizer was also studied. Bacterial populations were significantly reduced in all experiments, but only laundering in glutaraldehyde in combination with either detergent resulted in maximum removal of bacteria. Viable bacteria were usually not detected in the rinse water (< 1 viable organism/ 5 ml of rinse water) ...|$|R
