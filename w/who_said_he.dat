5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> acted too favorably toward the Indians, {{even though he}} moved the tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives by physical distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not {{be given to the}} tribes.

5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} a murder involving a hitman, Howard (Melissa Leo) and Felton (Daniel Baldwin) question Miles Stradinger (Paul Schulze), {{who serves as}} an arbitrator between hitmen and their customers. Stradinger gives up several of his clients, including Calpurnia Church (Mary Jefferson), a woman suspected of murdering five husbands for insurance money. Although Church denies killing anybody, the detectives find enough evidence to close many outstanding cases. Lewis, who had previously been investigating the Church case, believes his prayer with Crosetti led to her arrest. This is further upheld when Crosetti receives an anonymous call claiming a man named Alfred Smith shot Thormann. While searching for Smith, Crosetti meets a man named Charles Flavin (Larry E. Hull) <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> saw Smith shoot Thormann and will testify to it in court. The episode ends with Crosetti sitting with an unconscious Thormann {{in the hospital and}} listening to jazz music, which the two friends used to discuss frequently.|$|E

5|$|With the {{off-season}} acquisition of Mitch Clark in the 2011 trade period, who was {{projected to be}} the number one forward in the team, the forward load {{was expected to be}} relieved off of Watts, who new coach, Mark Neeld, stated would play primarily as a forward alongside Clark, rather than as both a forward and back as was the case the previous season. He struggled for form during the 2012 NAB Cup where he had just three combined possessions in the first two matches against Brisbane and Gold Coast, before he was substituted out of the match against Collingwood the next week where he managed just seven disposals, which drew the ire of former Collingwood coach, Mick Malthouse, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> lacked ambition when playing. He was subsequently omitted for the final pre-season match against Port Adelaide.|$|E
