25|$|Roy Halladay {{relieved}} Rogers in {{the bottom}} of the third. It was in this inning when the National League exemplified <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> best: playing small. Alfonso Soriano hit a single with one out and stole second base on Gold Glove catcher Iván Rodríguez. He tried to score on a single by Carlos Beltrán, but was thrown out at home plate by Vernon Wells. Beltran would advance to second on the throw, then steal third and score on a wild pitch by Halladay, giving the NL a 2–1 lead.|$|E
25|$|Shaffir was {{particularly}} vociferous in her {{objection to the}} transfer of millions of shekels to the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division, which circumvents oversight because legally it is {{under no obligation to}} report <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> with government funding. Shaffir wrote a letter signed by several other MKs to Knesset Legal Adviser Eyal Yinon complaining that Finance Committee Chair Slomiansky has a conflict of interest and {{should not be allowed to}} conduct meetings on the World Zionist Organization Settlement Division’s budget. The letter referred to research stating that the Settlement Division has ties to right-wing NGOs, which, in turn, are connected to The Jewish Home Party (Bayit Yehudi), Slomiansky’s party. Shaffir also argued against funding for the Jewish Identity Administration which she considered a ploy to promote a right wing political agenda.|$|E
25|$|Ozone, {{along with}} {{reactive}} forms of oxygen such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite ions, is naturally produced by {{white blood cells}} and other biological systems (such as the roots of marigolds) {{as a means of}} destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of trioxidane from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.|$|E

[...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone called the album [...] "the product of a first-rate lineup," [...] and praised the album's diversity, saying, [...] "The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist." [...] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the album an [...] "essential" [...] rating, and said, [...] "KMFDM has some major mojo working with Xtort".Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was less enthusiastic, saying, [...] "it would be nice to hear [...] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more", and commenting that while Xtort did not sound much different from previous releases, [...] "KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best."

500|$|Sophiatown {{is located}} on one of Johannesburg's ridges called Melville Koppies. Melville Koppies lies on the Kaapvaal craton, which dates from three billion years ago.

It also forms part of the lowest level of one of the world's most well known geological features, the Witwatersrand Supergroup. Several fairly narrow layers of gravel, deposited quite late in the sequence, and bearing heavy elements, made the Witwatersrand Supergroup famous. These are the gold-bearing conglomerates of the main reefs.

500|$|Cognitive {{science is}} the {{interdisciplinary}} {{scientific study of}} the mind and its processes. [...] It examines what cognition is, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> and how it works. [...] It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and education. It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. Rowlands argues [...] that cognition is [...] enactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The position is taken that the [...] "classical sandwich" [...] of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial; cognition has {{to be seen as a}} product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way.|$|E

Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 7.6 out of 10, summarizing that [...] "this one requires a lot of skill and technique, but the various antics and animations (especially on Kidd's enemy) are incredibly lifelike and make this one of the better games around." [...] IGN called the Super NES version overlooked and described it as a [...] "zany" [...] game that [...] "boasts stellar colors and some really frantic animation". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell described the video game J.J. & Jeff as a [...] "poor man's Plok/Kid Klown in Crazy Chase/Putty Quest/etc". Edge compared Let's Tap to Kid Klown due to the similar challenges found in Let's Taps multi-player mode.

Link commented, [...] "The film is, however, refreshingly different. What makes it better is, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have. It has, for instance, no [...] "star value." [...] " [...] Randor Guy wrote, [...] "Sridhar proved that movies could be made with new faces, limited sets and low budgets if one had an interesting, emotionally rich story, tautly narrated on screen with pleasing music". Guy concluded his review by stating that the film would be [...] "remembered for its excellent music and impressive performances by Muthuraman, Devika, , Nagesh, Manorama and child artiste Padmini." [...] Dinamalar praised the film for showing love as a divine thing.

500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{found the}} {{production}} of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, [...] "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." [...] Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines {{to be too much}} for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's [...] "flair for visceral action" [...] made up for Doomsdays lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, [...] "There's no question that Doomsday does <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." [...] Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the [...] "stellar" [...] work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of [...] "the beauty of the exploitation film era".
