50|$|The Oestridae are {{a family}} of flies {{variously}} known as bot <b>flies,</b> <b>warble</b> <b>flies,</b> heel flies, gadflies, and similar names.

50|$|Mosquitoes (Culicidae), black flies (Simuliidae), and oestrid <b>flies</b> (<b>warble</b> <b>flies)</b> Hypoderma tarandi {{and nose}} bot flies (Cephenemyia trompe) harass caribou herds {{particularly}} during the prime foraging period which is the post-calving and summer period. As temperatures on the tundra rose, {{the number of black}} and oestrid flies in the Bathurst barren-ground caribou herd study area in Northwest Territories increased. Feeding is inhibited and energy expended as panicked caribou attempt to escape insects resulting in loss of weight, poorer body condition and reproductive capacity. An adult reindeer will lose perhaps about 1 L of blood to biting insects for every week it spends in the tundra. So a warmer Arctic climate will produce better vegetation for foraging caribou, this will be offset by increased harassment by insects.|$|R
50|$|Nile lechwe can {{visually}} {{signal and}} vocalize {{to communicate with}} each other. They rear high in the air in front of their opponents and turn their heads to the side while displaying. Females are quite loud, making a toad-like croaking when moving. When fighting, males duck their heads and use their horns to push against each other. If one male is significantly smaller than the other, he may move next to the larger male in a parallel position and push from there, which prevents the larger male from pushing with all his force. Known predators are humans, lions, Nile crocodiles, Cape hunting dogs and leopards. They flee to water if disturbed, but females defend their offspring from smaller predators by direct attack, mainly kicking. Yearling Nile lechwes are often infected by <b>warble</b> <b>flies,</b> which can make them unhealthy and result in high mortality rates.|$|R
5000|$|Purdey's {{interest}} in the disease was triggered when four cows he purchased for his farm developed the disease, though no animal raised on his farm ever contracted it. He also became aware of a fact also considered by the Philips Inquiry: [...] "1145. The practice in the UK of recycling animal protein as an ingredient of animal feed dates back to at least 1926. In the 1970s attention was directed within MAFF to the danger that this practice {{would result in the}} spread of infectious diseases. The diseases considered were those caused by conventional viral and bacterial organisms. No consideration appears to have been given to the risk that scrapie might be recycled in sheep, or even transmitted to other farm animals. This may seem surprising. The answer probably {{lies in the fact that}} half a century had elapsed without any indication that animal feed containing ovine protein was infecting sheep or any other animal." [...] Purdey published a number of papers in which he set down his belief that BSE was a transmissible disease that had an environmental cause. He suggested this cause might be Phosmet, a systemic organophosphate insecticide that was being spread along the spines of intensively farmed cows to eradicate <b>warble</b> <b>fly.</b> Purdey believed that the chemicals, derived from military nerve gases, disturbed the balance of metals in the animals' brains, namely reducing copper and increasing manganese, giving rise to the misfolded proteins called prions that are regarded as the cause of BSE. Through the High Court, he successfully challenged the British government's compulsory <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> eradication program, which would have compelled him to treat his own cattle with the insecticide.|$|E
50|$|Restricted to five {{isolated}} {{mountain forest}} areas within the subtropical lower mountain wet forests and subtropical wet forest life zones {{of the main}} island of Puerto Rico, the subspecies has suffered a 40% decline in population since 1992. As of 1997, its estimated population is approximately 150 birds. Human causes in population decline are from deforestation due to road construction, power lines, and communications facilities installations which have significantly reduced its habitat area. Natural disasters such as hurricanes also contribute significantly to population declines. Nest failures due to fledgling infestation with botfly larvae, <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> larvae, and nest predation by the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) have also contributed to its population reduction. Although an overall population of 129 birds has been reported on the island (Delannoy, 1992), in El Yunque National Forest, the only two sharp-shinned hawks sighted at that time were a solitary territorial pair that were sighted in the south-central part of the forest.|$|E
50|$|Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawks select {{plantation}} {{and natural}} forest nest sites with similar vegetative structure and mountainous topography. Closed canopies and dense vegetation are {{sought by the}} hawks {{in the selection of}} nesting sites. They place their platform nests below the canopy on horizontal branches usually against the trunk or in crotches away from the trunk. Construction of nesting platforms usually begin in January after a breeding pair remain at their nesting sites permanently. Both males and females become more active in the nest building process one month before eggs are laid. Egg laying usually occurs during March and April and a second clutch may be laid rarely from May to July. Second clutches are only laid in the event the first brood of eggs is lost. Typical incubation periods last for one month. Nesting period ends once the juveniles fly short distances from the nest and roost in trees 10 to 15 meters (32 to 48 ft) from the nest. More than half of fledging failures are caused by <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> larvae.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Previous {{research}} shows that most mammals are reduced in fragmented forests, particularly species averse to human-modified landscapes. Since felids are elusive, sometimes nocturnal, and usually inhabit interior forest away from human activity, they {{can be difficult to}} study through in-person field observations. One effective approach to study felids is through camera trapping, where the captured images can be used to identify individuals of certain tropical felid species by their spots and bot <b>fly</b> <b>warbles.</b> To better understand the impacts of forest fragmentation on felids, the presence and distribution of both felids and their prey species were studied across a modified tropical forest gradient in the Piedras region of Madre de Dios, Peru. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare and relate species abundance and species diversity data for captured Peruvian mammals in response to land use and land cover changes (LUCC), specifically for jaguar, puma, and ocelot. Jaguar home range, distribution, and density estimates were also made using the program Camera Base. Twenty-three terrestrial mammal species were identified and assigned capture frequencies ranging from. 04 to 80. 7 (number of photos/ 1000 camera stations nights). Density of jaguars was estimated using the 8 individuals identified and data analysis in both Camera Base and DENSITY. The Jackknife Mh estimator with MMDM (mean maximum distance moved) was used to estimate jaguar density at approximately 5. 05 jaguars/ 100 sq km. Results of this research indicate healthy populations of jaguar and ocelot, and support the theory that felids are using human modified areas for movement, habitat, and hunting. In addition, seasonally used and minimally fragmented forests in the Piedras hold abundant biodiversity and can act as corridors between core habitat and protected areas for medium and large-sized mammals. Given the demonstrated diversity and vulnerability of the Piedras region, and that it represents one of the largest unprotected and largely intact tropical rainforests in Peru, this {{research shows}} both the importance of the region in supporting robust felid populations and the urgency needed to increase the protection of the region’s species and forests. The vast majority of studies looking at felids occur in protected areas like national parks, so monitoring felids in unprotected areas as a comparison is also vital...|$|R
