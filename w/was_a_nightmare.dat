5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the start}} of the 2000–01 season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> for Unterhaching as they would win only one and draw two of their first eight matches. While the team went undefeated in its next six matches, they were unable to {{maintain}} that form and at the mid-season break were only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. The {{second half of the season}} was just as dismal, and although they earned wins over local rivals Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, their campaign would end with a 16th-place result and relegation.|$|E
25|$|Beach's {{most famous}} {{invention}} was New York City's first subway, the Beach Pneumatic Transit. This came about during the 1860s, when traffic in New York <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare,</b> especially along the central artery, Broadway. Beach {{was one of}} a few visionaries who proposed building an underground railway under Broadway to help relieve the traffic congestion. The inspiration was the underground Metropolitan Railway in London but in contrast to that and others' proposals for New York, Beach proposed the use of trains propelled by pneumatics instead of conventional steam engines, and construction using a tunnelling shield of his invention to minimize disturbing the street.|$|E
25|$|The last {{series to}} be {{published}} by Innovation <b>was</b> <b>A</b> <b>Nightmare</b> On Elm Street: The Beginning.

Only the first two issues of the series were released before Innovation's declaration of bankruptcy, leaving the third issue unpublished and the story incomplete. Mangels had made the original script for issue number three available on his website, however the link seems now to be down.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{television}} commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona {{as a member}} of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian caps Kaká and Ronaldo. Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> after having drunk too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he has no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors' traditional rival. There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona, an example being footballer Diego Costa. In 2017, it was announced that Maradona would feature as a legendary player in the football video games FIFA 18 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in October 1950, F-82s {{would start}} flying weather {{reconnaissance}} pre-dawn missions over North Korea. At the same time, the squadron {{would also be}} responsible for keeping at least three aircraft on alert on airfields in the Seoul area (K-13 (Suwon) and K-14 (Kimpo)) during the hours of darkness and bad weather. This would become the main mission for the F-82s for the balance of 1950, as the F-51s, F-80s and F-84s took {{on most of the}} combat ground attack missions which the F-82s had been pressed into {{at the beginning of the}} war. With the entry of the Chinese Communist forces into the war, the situation on the ground began to deteriorate rapidly. By late December, the 68th had begun flying two-aircraft missions during daylight and single-aircraft missions at night from Kimpo AB. On 7 January, FEAF ordered the 68th to start flying armed reconnaissance missions to check roads over southern North Korea as UN forces were rapidly withdrawing south before the Chinese onslaught. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> as the Chinese were pouring south, and it appeared that the situation was becoming as it had been the previous June. On 26 January, the armed reconnaissance missions were discontinued and the F-82s were placed on continuous combat air patrols over Kandong Airfield near Pyongyang and over both of Pyongyang's main airfields, (K-23, Pyongyang and K-24, Pyongyang East) to monitor enemy air activity. This was essential as any Chinese aircraft operating out of these bases would be in easy range of the UN front lines. The 68th's efforts claimed 35 trucks destroyed, with damage to many others.|$|E

500|$|Other issues {{included}} the studio's desire to substitute Montreal or Prague for Paris {{in order to}} lower costs, Liman's insistence {{on the use of}} a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc. In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, Imperia, Rome, Mykonos, and Zürich; several scenes set in Zürich were also filmed in Prague. Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, [...] "When I hear people saying that the production <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> it's like, a 'nightmare'?

500|$|As the German Army {{was pushed}} {{back to its}} homeland, Benedetto and his company saw bitter {{fighting}} in cold winter conditions, often hunkering down in foxholes as German 88 mm guns fired on them. At the end of March, they crossed the Rhine and entered Germany, engaging in dangerous house-to-house, town-after-town fighting to clean out German soldiers; {{during the first week}} of April, they crossed the Kocher River, and by the end of the month reached the Danube. During his time in combat, Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times. The experience made him a pacifist; he would later write, [...] "Anybody who thinks that war is romantic obviously hasn't gone through one," [...] and later say, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that's permanent. I just said, 'This is not life. This is not life.'" [...] At the war's conclusion he was involved in the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp near Landsberg, where some American prisoners of war from the 63rd Division had also been held.|$|E
500|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{was killed}} on 5 November 2010 {{following}} an eight-hour shootout between gunmen of the Gulf Cartel and soldiers of the Mexican Navy {{in his hometown of}} Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Government sources claimed that this operation—where more than 660 marines, 17 vehicles, and 3 helicopters participated—left 10 dead: three marines, one soldier, four Gulf Cartel gunmen, journalist Carlos Alberto Guajardo Romero, and the drug lord Antonio Ezequiel. The shootout began at around 10:00a.m. and extended to 6:00p.m., when Antonio Ezequiel and gunmen of his inner circle were killed. The intensity of the shootout forced the temporary closure of the international bridges that connect Matamoros with the US border city of Brownsville, Texas, along with the University of Texas at Brownsville, which {{sits on the edge of}} the Rio Grande River. The daylight clashes generated a wave of panic among the citizens of Matamoros, who turned to social networks like Twitter and Facebook to report the violence. [...] "Shelter, everyone! Don't leave your houses please. Pass the word," [...] read one tweet. People hid inside their homes or in windowless offices, sometimes peaking to see the cartel mayhem. Witnesses reported seeing military men carrying guns, and armed Gulf Cartel members in their own military uniforms. Power went out in several parts of downtown Matamoros, where most of the heavy gunfighting took place. Communication equipment, like cellphones and radios, were not working. Gulf Cartel gunmen hijacked several buses to block roads all across the city to prevent the mobilization of the Mexican Armed Forces. Hovering helicopters from the Navy shot down at Antonio Ezequiel's henchmen. [...] "The city was paralyzed," [...] said an office worker who hid for hours inside a building. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> It went on and on." [...] News reports described 5 November 2010 as one of Matamoros's bloodiest days.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
