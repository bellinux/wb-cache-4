Since 1990, the number of colonies of bees in the Czech Republic has been decreased. This is because of various reasons but one of the main causes is varroa destructor.

40|$|The {{resilience}} of coastal social-ecological systems {{may depend on}} adaptive responses to aquaculture disease outbreaks that can threaten wild and farm fish. A nine-year study of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Pacific Canada indicates that adaptive changes in parasite management on salmon farms have yielded positive conservation outcomes. After four years of sea lice epizootics and wild salmon population decline, parasiticide application on salmon farms was adapted to the timing of wild salmon migrations. <b>Winter</b> <b>treatment</b> of farm fish with parasiticides, prior to the out-migration of wild juvenile salmon, has reduced epizootics of wild salmon without significantly increasing the annual number of treatments.

These adaptive changes have not occurred through formal adaptive management, but rather, through multi-stakeholder processes arising from a contentious scientific and public debate. Despite the apparent success of parasite control on salmon farms in the study region, there remain concerns about the long-term sustainability of this approach because of the unknown ecological effects of parasticides and the potential for parasite resistance to chemical treatments. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America...|$|E

Vegetation response to altered timing of precipitation was assessed during a 7 -year experiment in an Artemisia tridentata spp. wyomingensis community in the northern Great Basin, USA. Four permanent rainout shelters excluded natural rainfall, with seasonal distribution of precipitation controlled with the use of an overhead sprinkler system. Precipitation treatments under each shelter were WINTER, SPRING, and CURRENT. The <b>WINTER</b> <b>treatment</b> received 80 % of its water between October and March; in the SPRING treatment 80 % of total water was applied between April and July; and the CURRENT treatment received precipitation matching the site’s long-term (50 years) distribution pattern.

CURRENT, WINTER, and CONTROL treatments had similar in soil water-content patterns and thus, there were few consistent differences in vegetation response. The SPRING treatment resulted in more bare-ground and lower plant productivity compared to other shelter treatments. This result contrasted with our initial hypothesis that shallower-rooted grasses would gain a competitive advantage over shrubs if precipitation was shifted from winter to spring.

Heifers developed in DL had increased BW after <b>winter</b> <b>treatment</b> until breeding. Both heifer groups were similar in percent of heifers cycling, AI conception, AI pregnancy, and final pregnancy diagnosis. A subset of AI pregnant heifers were blocked by weight and stratified by winter development system and individually fed using a Calan Gates System to measure individual feed intake. Heifers developed on CR, although lighter, had similar ADG and feed efficiency compared to DL heifers. Excess pregnant heifers were assigned to graze CR during late gestation based on previous heifer development. Late gestating heifers developed on corn CR had similar ADG compared to heifers developed in DL. Similarly, Exp. 2 evaluated the effect of heifers grazing dormant winter range (WR) or grazing CR during post-weaning development. Heifers developed on CR were similar in ADG and BW throughout winter development and breeding. Reproductive performance indicated a similar percent of heifers cycling and final pregnancy diagnosis between groups. A portion of pregnant heifers was blocked by weight and assigned to graze one of three corn residue fields in late gestation based on previous heifer development. Late gestating heifers developed on CR had similar ADG compared to heifers developed on WR. In summary, these experiments provide evidence to support development of heifers on dormant winter forage systems without sacrificing reproductive performance, feed efficiency, and ADG during late gestation.

40|$|Future climate {{scenarios}} predict increased air {{temperatures and}} precipitation, particularly at high latitudes, and especially so during winter. Soil temperatures, however, {{are more difficult}} to predict, since they depend strongly on the fate of the insulating snow cover. ‘Rain-on-snow’ events and warm spells during winter can lead to thaw–freeze cycles, compacted snow and ice encasement, as well as local flooding. These adverse conditions could counteract the otherwise positive effects of climatic changes on forest seedling growth. In order to study the effects of different winter and snow conditions on young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which 80 1 -year-old Scots pine seedlings were distributed between four winter treatments in dasotrons: ambient snow cover (SNOW), compressed snow and ice encasement (ICE), flooded and frozen soil (FLOOD) and no snow (NO SNOW). During the <b>winter</b> <b>treatment</b> period and a 1. 5 -month simulated spring/early summer phase, we monitored the needle, stem and root biomass of the seedlings, and determined their starch and soluble sugar concentrations. In addition, we assessed the stress experienced by the seedlings by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, electric impedance and photosynthesis of the previous-year needles. Compared with the SNOW treatment, carbohydrate concentrations were lower in the FLOOD and NO SNOW treatments where the seedlings had almost died {{before the end of the}} experiment, presumably due to frost desiccation of aboveground parts during the winter treatments. The seedlings of the ICE treatment showed dead needles and stems only above the snow and ice cover.

40|$|Background: Conditions {{experienced}} {{by a female}} during early life may afect her reproductive strategies and maternal investment later in life. This efect of early environmental conditions is a potentially important mechanism by which animals can compensate for the negative impacts of climate change. In this study, we experimentally tested whether three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) change their maternal strategy according to environmen‑ tal temperatures experienced earlier in life. We studied maternal investment from a life-history perspective because females are expected to adjust their reproductive strategy {{in relation to their}} current and future reproductive returns as well as ofspring ftness. Results: F 1 families were reared in control and elevated winter temperatures and their reproductive trajectories were studied when returned to common conditions. Females that had experienced the warm <b>winter</b> <b>treatment</b> (n = 141) had a lower fecundity and reduced breeding and total lifespan compared to the control individuals (n = 159). Whereas the control females tended to produce their heaviest and largest clutches in their frst reproductive attempt, the warm-acclimated females invested less in their frst clutch, but then produced increasingly heavy clutches {{over the course of the}} breeding season. Egg mass increased with clutch number at a similar rate in the two groups. The warm-acclimated females increased the investment of carotenoids in the frst and last clutches of the season. Thus, any transgenerational efects of the maternal thermal environment on ofspring phenotype may be mediated by the allocation of antioxidants into eggs but not by egg size. Conclusions: Our results indicate that conditions {{experienced by}} females during juvenile life have a profound efect on life-time maternal reproductive strategies. The temperature-induced changes in maternal strategy may be due to constraints imposed by the higher energetic costs of a warm environment, but it is possible that they allow the ofspring to compensate for higher energetic costs and damage when they face the same thermal stress as did their mothers...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the impact of development systems, maternal protein supplementation, and estrus synchronization systems on beef cattle. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of winter supplementation on cow performance {{and the effects of}} post-weaning management on progeny. Late spring calving cows grazed dormant range or meadow over winter and received either supplementation or no supplementation. Steer and heifer progeny were weaned and placed on dormant meadow or fed hay ad libitum. One half of the steers were placed in the feedlot at the end of treatment and the other half grazed range over summer. Cow <b>winter</b> <b>treatment</b> did not affect cow performance. Steers and heifers fed hay had increased ADG during winter trt compared to calves on meadow. Feedlot system did not {{have a significant effect on}} carcass data. In experiment 2, cows were synchronized for fixed-time AI (TAI) utilizing the CO-Synch and the CO-Synch + CIDR protocols. Cows synchronized with the CO-Synch + CIDR protocol had increased AI pregnancy rates compared to CO-Synch synchronized cows. In experiment 3, heifers were synchronized for TAI using the MGA + PGF 2 α protocol or CO-Synch + CIDR protocol. Half of the CO-Synch + CIDR heifers received PGF 2 α at the time of CIDR insertion. Heifers were time stamped at the time of final PGF 2 α administration and at the TAI. Pregnancy rates were not affected due to PGF 2 α administration at the time of CIDR insertion or time interval between final PGF 2 α administration and TAI. In summary, these experiments provide evidence to support the following findings: (1) there are minimal effects of winter supplementation on late spring calving cows and progeny performance; (2) post-weaning treatment had minimal effects on heifer and steer productivity; (3) cows utilizing CO-Synch + CIDR AI protocol have higher pregnancy rates; (4) fluctuations in time interval from time of PG administration to breeding had no effects on pregnancy rates.

In the past decade Italian and European populations of C. pyri have been less damaging, probably because of success of integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In Northern Italy orchards the most common defense strategy against C. pyri involves treatments on second-generation pests by abamectin, or less frequently by spirodiclofen.

Surveillance programs have therefore been established in Northern Italy and Spain for abamectin: no relevant resistance effects have been yet detected, but since LC 50 and LC 90 values are always higher in populations undergoing repeated abamectin treatments, the pear orchards where C. pyri outbreaks recently occurred are still under close investigation...|$|R

In situ field experiments demonstrated that BBD progressed along branches approximately {{twice as fast}} (1. 7 – 2. 4 times) during the austral summer month of January (0. 99 ± 0. 04 cm/day) than in the cooler months of July (0. 58 ± 0. 04 cm/day) and May (0. 41 ± 0. 07 cm/day). Transmission of BBD between colonies was also accelerated in warmer months, with signs of infection becoming visible 1. 2 days earlier in January compared to May. The greater seawater temperatures by ∼ 2 to 3 °C and light intensities by up to 650 μE/m 2 /s in January, suggest that rates of progression and transmission of BBD are linked to {{one or both of}} these parameters. Manipulative experiments in summer provide corroborative evidence that elevated temperatures increase rates of BBD progression, with the disease progressing 1. 3 times more rapidly in the 32 °C elevated temperature treatment than in the 30 °C ambient treatment (1. 17 ± 0. 06 cm/day versus 0. 92 ± 0. 07 cm/day; F 2, 6 = 7. 66, P = 0. 022).

There was a trend for the liveweight gains of the steers on the PP + SNP treatment to be higher from housing in autumn 2002, and live weights on all treatments were similar {{at the start of the}} red clover-feeding phase. Steers offered red clover silage had a significantly higher liveweight gains than those offered grass silage, but there was only a trend for a higher live weight at the end of the winter-feeding period. During summer 2003, liveweight gains were again higher on the permanent pasture. Finishing system significantly affected the fatty-acid profile of the meat produced, but there was no difference in the colour of meat in relation to shelf-life. Lipid oxidation was less for the meat from steers on the PP + SNP treatment than on the PP treatment, which, in turn, was less than for meat from the steers on the PP + RC treatment, and was in inverse proportion to the vitamin E concentration in the loin muscle. There were no significant differences in sensory panel scores for texture, juiciness or flavour of the meat. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of an invited review and four experiments was to evaluate production implications and economic efficiencies of beef systems strategies involving calving date selection, utilization of reproductive technology, and post-weaning management of heifers and steers. The invited review in chapter II considers {{factors that influence}} a producer’s decision on when to calve beef females. The calving date decision impacts the entire beef production cycle and {{must take into account}} any environmental conditions, available resources, and cite specific advantages and/or disadvantages. Understanding the importance of varying physiological state and nutrient demands associated with lactation and gestation is critical to optimizing calving date. Calving systems vary across geographic regions. The associated differences in management strategies, along with economic drivers, contribute to the complexity of the calving date decision. Chapter III evaluates the effects of overwinter nutrition on subsequent May calving cow performance. Supplemented cows had increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) BCS and BW change over <b>winter</b> <b>treatment</b> period compared to unsupplemented cows. Cows grazed either dormant upland range or meadow during the winter period. Pasture treatment had an effect on winter BW gain, pre-calving BW, lactation BW gain, pregnancy rate, as well as progeny birth and weaning BW. Pregnancy rate (P = 0. 05) and calf birth BW (P = 0. 03) were lower, and calf WW tended (P = 0. 06) to be lower for cows that grazed dormant range without supplement. Chapter IV compares a modified fixed-time AI protocol to fixed-time AI. Heifer reproductive performance at both AI conception and overall conception rate was similar (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in both treatments. Chapter V evaluates the effects of a Revalor G implant on reproduction and growth performance of 12 mo old beef heifers. Implanting heifers reduced conception rate by 18 percentage points in implanted heifers, but resulted in a 6 kg growth advantage over non-implanted heifers. Chapter VI compares four supplement sources on growth performance of steers grazing irrigated corn residue. Supplementing with dried distiller grains and SoyPass/SBM blend provided sufficient CP in the form of RDP and RUP for steers to gain at rates above 0. 45 kg/d, while supplementing with corn grain and corn grain + RDP resulted in gains far below (3 ̆c 0. 2 kg/d) other treatments. Growing steers will require protein supplementation in the form of both RUP and RDP in order to optimize growth performance while grazing corn residue. Advisors: Richard N. Funston and Jim C.

40|$|Organic {{phosphorus}} (P) is {{an important}} source of phosphate for plants both in natural environments and in cultivated soils. Growing plants with high P recycling capacity may increase the importance of organic forms in phosphate availability mainly in undisturbed soils. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of long period of cultivation of different winter species under different soil management systems in the distribution of soil organic P forms, in the P content stored into the soil microbial biomass (SMB) and in the acid phosphatase enzyme activity. The experiment was established in 1986 with six <b>winter</b> <b>treatments</b> (blue lupine, hairy vetch, oat, radish, wheat and fallow) implanted in a Rhodic Hapludox in southern Brazil, under no-tillage system (NT) and conventional tillage system (CT). The crops were cultivated with rational use of chemical phosphate fertilizer, according to plant needs and soil type maintaining high levels of soil organic carbon leading to P organic form accumulation. Growing crops during the winter period in highly weathered subtropical soil increases the importance of microbial interactions in the P cycle, especially in the NT, where a large amount of crop residues is annually added to the soil surface, increasing soil organic P level, P content stored into the SMB and acid phosphatase enzyme activity...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{of heaven}} (Ailanthus altissima) is {{regarded}} as invasive within urban and natural areas worldwide. Efficient methods to control it are significantly needed {{if we are to}} limit its well-known environmental and economic impacts. Up to now the use of herbicides has proven necessary since following mechanical damage, Ailanthus vigorously resprouts. However, the seasonal response of Ailanthus stems, treated with herbicides, has never been assessed. We compared the control efficacy recorded in autumn, winter and summer in an abandoned suburban citrus grove in Sicily, under Mediterranean-climate conditions. Glyphosate was injected within drill holes made in knee-high cut trees. Tree mortality and the resprouting ability of treated stems were significantly affected by the application timing and by diameter class of stems. Mortality was significantly lower in <b>winter</b> <b>treatments</b> within the smaller diameter class. Within the larger diameter class, only autumn treatments showed a notably higher mortality rate and a significantly lower growth of sprouts. Hence, autumn interventions are strongly recommended to effectively treat Ailanthus. Mortality was notably higher in the smaller diameter class. Our results confirm the importance of early intervention to control Ailanthus, also showing that the choice of the season is crucial to obtaining satisfactory control of its resprouting ability...|$|R
