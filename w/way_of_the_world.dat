25|$|An early {{example of}} this trend is William Congreve, {{one of the most}} {{important}} writers for the late 18th London stage. Although born in Yorkshire, Congreve grew up in Ireland and studied with Jonathan Swift in Kilkenny and at Trinity College, Dublin. After graduating, Congreve moved to London to study law at the Temple and pursue a literary career. His first play, The Old Bachelor (1693) was sponsored by John Dryden, and he went on to write at least four more plays. The last of these, The <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> (1700) is the one Congreve work regularly revived on the modern stage. However, at the time of its creation, it was a relative failure and he wrote no further works for the theatre.|$|E

For A Room With a View, she also received her fifth Academy Award nomination and won her second Golden Globe Award. In 1987, she starred in A Bed Among the Lentils, part of Alan Bennett's Talking Heads series, receiving a second BAFTA TV nomination. She starred in the 1987 London production of Lettice and Lovage alongside Margaret Tyzack, receiving an Olivier Award nomination and reprised the role in 1990, when it transferred to Broadway and won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

500|$|Doran's company {{specialised}} in the classics, principally Shakespeare. After {{two years}} of period costumes Richardson felt the urge {{to act in a}} modern work. He left Doran in 1923 and toured in a new play, Outward Bound by Sutton Vane. He returned to the classics in August 1924, in Nigel Playfair's touring production of The <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> playing Fainall. [...] While on that tour he married Muriel Hewitt, a young member of Doran's company, known to him as [...] "Kit". To his great happiness, the two were able to work together for most of 1925, both being engaged by Sir Barry Jackson of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre for a touring production of The Farmer's Wife. From December of that year they were members of the main repertory company in Birmingham. Through Jackson's chief director, the veteran taskmaster H K Ayliff, Richardson [...] "absorbed the influence of older contemporaries like Gerald du Maurier, Charles Hawtrey and Mrs Patrick Campbell." [...] Hewitt was seen as a rising star but Richardson's talents were not yet so apparent; he was allotted supporting roles such as Lane in The Importance of Being Earnest and Albert Prossor in Hobson's Choice.|$|E
500|$|The music {{atmosphere}} of the 1970s was heavily influenced by its success and sexual content, as its sexual-explicitness bent creative barriers {{in the music industry}} and led to an increased popularity of sexual themes in music at the time. Music writer Rob Bowman later cited Let's Get It On as [...] "one of the most erotic recordings known to mankind." [...] The album's success helped spark a series of similarly styled releases by such smooth soul artists as Barry White (Can't Get Enough), Smokey Robinson (A Quiet Storm) and Earth, Wind & Fire (That's the <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World).</b> The commercial success of such recording artists led to a change of trend from socially conscious aesthetics to more mainstream, sensually themed music. Gaye himself experienced subsequent success with his follow-up release I Want You (1976), featuring more sexually explicit lyrics and expanded use of vocal multi-tracking, and with Here, My Dear (1978), which he based entirely on his tumultuous marriage to Anna Gordy. In an interview with music author Michael Eric Dyson, hip hop artist Q-Tip discussed the album's influence and significance to its time period, stating: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the decade}} from 1910 to the {{aftermath}} of the First World War Shaw wrote four full-length plays, the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works. Fanny's First Play (1911) continues his earlier examinations of middle-class British society from a Fabian viewpoint, with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play. Androcles and the Lion (1912), which Shaw began writing as a play for children, became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice. Pygmalion (1912) is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships. To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending {{to make it clear that}} the heroine will marry another, minor character. Shaw's only full-length play from the war years is Heartbreak House (1917), which in his words depicts [...] "cultured, leisured Europe before the war" [...] drifting towards disaster. Shaw named Shakespeare (King Lear) and Chekhov (The Cherry Orchard) as important influences on the piece, and critics have found elements drawing on Congreve (The <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World)</b> and Ibsen (The Master Builder).|$|E
500|$|Quatermass {{met with}} a {{generally}} unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E
500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Austen {{scholarship}} has concerned {{the question of}} the Bildungsroman (novel of education). D.D Devlin in Jane Austen and Education (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways [...] Bildungsroman, where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book The <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> [...] called Pride and Prejudice a [...] "classic" [...] Bildungsroman, where Elizabeth Bennet's [...] "prejudice" [...] against Mr. Darcy is really [...] "distrust" [...] and that she [...] "shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an excess of criticism, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust a priori. Moretti argued that in a typical Bildungsroman of the early 19th century was concerned with [...] "everyday life", which represented [...] "an unchallenged stability of social relationships" [...] in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book The Historicity of Romantic Discourse argued that all of Austen's books were Bildungsroman, where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly [...] "internal" [...] as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their [...] "self". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her [...] "prejudice" [...] against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an [...] "external" [...] to [...] "internal" [...] conflict.|$|E
