5|$|McCarthyism <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} groups, {{including}} the American Legion {{and various other}} anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's {{groups such as the}} American Public Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{after an}} unreceptive tour {{with the band}} Tool, Mit Gas has been {{described}} by critics as a more focused and unified album than its predecessor, Tomahawk. The album <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tour alongside Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Mit Gas has garnered positive reviews, drawing comparisons to the works of Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.|$|E

5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Simple Science, the band decided to combine the {{remaining}} tracks—along with three more newly recorded songs—into a new full-length album, There Are Rules. They also confirmed that the album would not be released on Vagrant Records, who had released their previous three albums, but on their own Quality Hill Records. The album was produced by Ed Rose and mixed by Bob Weston, who produced the band's debut album. There Are Rules was released on January 25, 2011, and <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> co-headlining tour with Saves The Day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties {{had turned}} away from the more feudal culture of the {{preceding}} Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, Daoism and Buddhism reigned as core ideologies as well, and played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E

On 22 July 2008, the brigade's soldiers underwent final preparations before departing Rammstein Air Base for northern Iraq. The brigade operated out of Contingency Operating Base Q-West, which <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dozen Iraqi small businesses.|$|E
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led Congress {{to pass by}} {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production and sale of child porn. This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E
