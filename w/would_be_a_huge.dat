5|$|Vivah premiered on 10 November 2006 across India. Like Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Rajshri Productions {{released}} {{limited number}} of prints for the film and eventually increased prints with increasing popularity. Early reviewers of Vivah predicted that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> disappointment. The film opened well {{and went on to}} become a commercially successful venture.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in {{southern}} Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw {{a very limited}} release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually it started to appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! predicted that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> flop; hence the industry was stunned when it {{went on to become}} the most successful film of all time up to that point.|$|E
5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal {{as soon as the}} Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> Duryodhana <b>is</b> dying, Krishna {{comes to}} him, {{and the two}} talk about the {{strategic}} mistakes Duryodhana had made. One of these was Duryodhana's failure to recruit Vidura. Vidura's brilliant mind <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> boon to the Kaurava tactics, rivaling Krishna on the Pandavas' side.|$|R
500|$|Ziggurats were {{elevated}} temples {{constructed by}} the Sumerians {{between the end of}} the 4th millennium BC and the 2nd millennium BC, rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to [...] above ground level. The Ziggurat of Ur contained about three million bricks, none more than [...] in length, so construction <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> project.|$|R
50|$|The young Barbra Streisand begged Banducci for {{a single}} night at his nightclub, insisting that she <b>would</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> star. Banducci agreed to sign the singer, who had never {{performed}} professionally but was soon starring in I Can Get It for You Wholesale on Broadway. The resulting concerts (March-April 1963) were well-attended, giving Streisand nationwide acclaim.|$|R
25|$|For example, {{in order}} {{to live up to the}} ideal of {{self-determination}} laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} {{possible}} inequality was {{the removal of}} women’s softball from the summer Olympics for 2012, which {{was considered one of}} the most popular women’s sports in the summer Olympics. Critics have argued that reinstating women’s softball in the 2016 Olympic Games <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> step towards gender equality, and they also suggest requiring each event at the Games to have a women equivalent, not just each sport. For example, if there are 10 men’s boxing events, there should also be 10 women’s boxing events. They believe that this is necessary because the Olympic Games need to set a high standard for sports programs and countries around the world to follow.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Lawrence {{returned}} to Broadway opposite Clifton Webb in Treasure Girl, a Gershwin work she was confident <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit. Anticipating a long run, {{she arrived in}} New York with her daughter Pamela, a personal maid and two cars, and settled into a flat on Park Avenue. Her instincts about the musical were wrong; audiences had difficulty accepting her as an avaricious woman who double-crosses her lover, and it ran for only 68 performances. She starred opposite Leslie Howard in Candle Light, an Austrian play adapted by Wodehouse, in 1929, and in 1931 she and Noël Coward triumphed in his play Private Lives, first in the UK, and later on Broadway.|$|E
50|$|The first {{theatrical}} film released {{under the}} Family Entertainment label was Dennis the Menace, {{released in the}} summer of 1993. The film proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit at the box office, grossing over $50 million at the domestic box office. Following it was Free Willy, which was also released {{in the summer of}} 1993, and <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> box office hit, grossing over $75 million domestically.|$|R
50|$|To Gado it was {{immediately}} {{obvious that the}} same concept <b>would</b> not only <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success in Kenya, but could also have an important social impact by exposing, with humor, the rampant corruption and mismanagement of the country.|$|R
50|$|Suomen Robinson was the Finnish reality {{television}} program debuted in 2004. In {{the spring of}} 2004 Nelonen purchased the broadcast rights to air {{their own version of}} Expedition Robinson. Seeing the success of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish versions of the show TV4 assumed that their own version <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success. They <b>were</b> wrong in their assumption and due to competition from shows like Big Brother after two seasons the show was cancelled due to low ratings.|$|R
25|$|Parker {{immediately}} {{went to work}} {{to find a new}} label for Presley. Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest, although their initial offers were nowhere near the $40,000 requirement. RCA Victor, Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were also put off by the cost of the contract. However, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes was convinced that Presley's style of music <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit with the right label, and he began talks with Parker. RCA made it very clear they were unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer, but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer. Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted once again to sell Tommy Sands to RCA. He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley's style. Sholes, remembering his previous experience with Sands, dismissed him as a viable replacement for Presley.|$|E
25|$|Entertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, {{and sailors}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{business}} {{and resulted in}} varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment. Except {{for a couple of}} restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments. They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and deadfalls which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical reed organs which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of cabaret which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor. The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured can-can dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.|$|E
25|$|The {{game against}} the Notre Dame All-Stars had been {{originally}} devised by Frankford. It was planned as non-league exhibition game between former Notre Dame stars and the top NFL team in the east; after defeating the Maroons 20–0, Frankford had believed they would indeed be the NFL's top eastern team. However, when they were later defeated by the Maroons in a second contest, they lost the right to play the game. Instead, Pottsville would host the All-Stars at Minersville Park, while Frankford scheduled another league {{game against the}} Cleveland Bulldogs. Pottsville was excited to host Notre Dame, hoping it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> financial windfall for the team. However, they felt that Minersville Park, a high school field with a low capacity, was too small for such a big event. Instead, they scheduled the game in Philadelphia, in the Yellow Jackets' territory. Frankford protested to commissioner Carr, who warned the Maroons in writing that they faced suspension if they played in Philadelphia. However, the Maroons claimed that the league office verbally approved the game during a telephone call.|$|E
5000|$|... "All My Loving" [...] {{has been}} praised by several critics. Ian MacDonald said, [...] "The innocence of early Sixties British pop is {{perfectly}} distilled in the eloquent simplicity of this number" [...] {{and described the}} song as helping McCartney be seen as more of an equal to Lennon. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said it [...] "was arguably the best LP-only track the Beatles did before 1964" [...] and that if it had <b>been</b> released as <b>a</b> single in America it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit.|$|R
5000|$|Mathematicians {{who have}} {{discussed}} the film praised the writer's attempt to bring a serious math problem to the big screen, although they questioned whether the world <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as dramatically affected by its solution: [...] "Despite our caveat that a solution to travelling salesman problem might not be to die for, let alone to kill for, it <b>would</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> change in {{our knowledge of the}} world. The implications could be unlimited. We certainly hope the movie raises awareness of computer science theory and the life importance of its subject matter." ...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} non-military {{activity of the}} Roman army was construction. The army <b>was</b> <b>a</b> large workforce of fit, disciplined men which also comprised hundreds of skilled craftsmen. Troops were on regular salaries anyway, so it was cheaper {{for the government to}} use them for building projects, if the security situation in the province allowed, than to hire private contractors. In fact, soldiers spent far more of their working lives on building-sites than on campaign and it <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> exaggeration to describe an imperial legion as an armed construction-gang.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} {{has not been}} without criticism, with {{many people in the}} city commenting on the lack of people in the area, while architect Maxwell Hutchinson described them as the [...] "slums of the future". and described the development as a [...] "mundane collection" [...] of buildings and an [...] "incredibly soulless place" [...] and claimed that [...] "in two or three decades these shiny new buildings will be following Quarry Hill down the spiral of decay". These claims were explored on the BBC television programme Inside Out. While at a fashion show at Leeds Dock, Gok Wan claimed he thought the development <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success.|$|E
500|$|Hogard {{devised a}} scheme to cut a new channel from the {{junction}} of the Welland and the Glen to Wyberton, on the estuary of the River Witham below Boston. At {{the end of the}} [...] cut, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> sluice and a navigation lock. The Adventurers asked Thomas Tofield for a second opinion, who suggested a shorter [...] cut from Spalding to Fosdyke. They requested help from Grundy, who proposed a [...] cut to Fosdyke, and that the outfall of Vernatt's drain should be moved [...] downstream. Improvements to the drain were carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1774, and an act was obtained in 1794 to sanction the Wyberton cut, although the work was not carried out, and Grundy's cut was built under a new act of 1801.|$|E

25|$|Although {{fusion power}} uses nuclear technology, the overlap {{with nuclear weapons}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> limited. <b>A</b> <b>huge</b> amount of tritium could <b>be</b> {{produced}} by <b>a</b> fusion power station; tritium {{is used in the}} trigger of hydrogen bombs and in a modern boosted fission weapon, {{but it can also be}} produced by nuclear fission. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade plutonium or uranium for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of U238 to Pu239, or Th232 to U233).|$|R
2500|$|Hoax theory-debunker Philip Plait says in {{his book}} Bad Astronomy, that the Soviets – with their own {{competing}} Moon program, an extensive intelligence network and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have cried foul if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing, especially since their own program had failed. Proving <b>a</b> hoax <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> propaganda win for the Soviets. Conspiracist Bart Sibrel responded, [...] "the Soviets {{did not have the}} capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled." ...|$|R
50|$|Emboldened, Rudolf's forces met Henry's at the White Elster {{river in}} the Battle of Elster. The battle, which took place on 14 October 1080, <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> victory for the anti-royalists. However, Rudolf lost his right hand in the battle and was mortally wounded in the abdomen. He withdrew to nearby Merseburg, where he died {{the next day and}} was buried. The {{majority}} of the support for the rebellion against Henry IV soon evaporated, but the struggle continued on in effect into 1085, with a final flare up in 1088 under Rudolph's successor, the second anti-king, Herman of Luxembourg.|$|R
500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E
500|$|The BX {{arrived in}} South Fort George on June 24, to {{a warm welcome}} from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local {{residents}} had been anticipating {{the day of the}} BX's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. [...] The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George.|$|E

2500|$|Browne had {{a severe}} {{heart attack at}} the {{beginning}} of May 1955, and the night before her seventy-fifth birthday she died. [...] The worst offence that was afforded to Browne can be found on her death certificate where under occupation she is noted as being a “Spinster: No occupation.” Considering her opinion that women should not be labelled for their choice not to marry, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> insult to Browne.|$|E
2500|$|The A-Team was not {{generally}} expected to become a hit, although Stephen J.

The show became very popular; the first regular episode, which aired after Super Bowl XVII on January 30, 1983, reached 26.4% of the television audience, placing fourth in the top 10 Nielsen-rated shows. [...] The A-Team was portrayed as acting {{on the side of}} good and helping the oppressed.|$|E
2500|$|International market {{research}} done by The Coca-Cola Company {{in the late}} 1980s revealed that [...] "Coke" [...] was the second most recognizable word across all languages in the world.

5000|$|Some, {{including}} Jim Muir of the BBC, {{have questioned}} whether a bomb killed Al-Bouti.
