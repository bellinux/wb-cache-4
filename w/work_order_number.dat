The question comma has a comma instead of the dot {{at the bottom of}} a question mark, while the exclamation comma has a comma in place of the point {{at the bottom of a}}n exclamation mark. These were intended for use as question and exclamation marks within a sentence, a function for which normal question and exclamation marks can also be used, but which may be considered obsolescent.

This study also determines if the ConCert program improves "quality at the source" and if it should be rolled out to other Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW) product lines. Data from FRCSW E- 2 /C- 2 production line was analyzed.

Critical areas examined were the number of defects discovered in the hangar, the number of defects that were not discovered until the aircraft arrived on the test line, and the number of defects that made it to the customer. The analysis of the data revealed that ConCert appears to effectively perform the quality verification function. Furthermore, the data shows that quality has improved; however, the source of the improvement cannot be linked solely to ConCert...|$|R

Electrical department provide supply electricity to producer wells, office and housing. To support its daily operation the team consist of two department, operation and maintenance team. Maintenance team is responsible for preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM) and corrective job. Maintenance activities of transmission and distribution lines without shutdown the energize line called Hot Line Work. With hotline work activities could prevent production loss during maintenance job. Based on Computerized Maintenance Management System data in 2015 there were 432 <b>work</b> <b>order</b> active in electrical maintenance team. <b>Work</b> <b>orders</b> active are <b>number</b> of active <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> in open status {{at the end of}} the month and not shutdown classification, 278 of 432 <b>work</b> <b>order</b> active are under maintenance power line team. In this study we propose alternatives to reduce <b>work</b> <b>order</b> active in power line team. In this study fish bone diagram and pareto chart is applied to analyze the problem and find the root of problem. Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) used in decision making process. SMART is used in this study because with this method allow complex problem to be decomposed into sets of simpler judgment. This simplicity influences directly on the understanding of the decision maker about the process used in the solution of the problem since the decision making process involving many decision makers from various background. The TOWS matrix is used in alternative generation. Brainstorming tool is used in attribute identification. Interval scale form is used in measuring the weight of attribute and attribute value to each alternative. From TOWS matrix there were four (4) alternatives generated. Alternative 1 : Purchase new bucket truck by PT. NYZ and operator of bucket truck from PT. NYZ employee. Alternative 2 : Purchase new bucket truck by PT. NYZ and the operator of bucket truck provided by labor contract. Alternative 3 : Contract out bucket truck using lump sum type contract and the operator of bucket truck from PT. NYZ employee. Alternative 4 : Contract out bucket truck and operator using work unit rate type contract. From the study result alternative 3 was chosen as the selected alternative. The consideration from decision makers are: safety aspect, with alternative 3 operator for bucket truck will provided from PT. NYZ employee and this work categorized on high risk job; from sensitivity analysis the alternative 3 is the robust; availability in market and permit administration that currently as the main issue, with contractor provide the bucket truck including maintenance and permitting with lump sum type contract it could improve availability of bucket truck and reduce <b>number</b> of <b>work</b> <b>order</b> active in power line maintenance team.

50|$|A {{sales order}} is an {{internal}} document of the company, meaning it {{is generated by}} the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating purchase order which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, an internal sales order form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored as a sequential sales <b>order</b> <b>number</b> {{can be used by}} the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a <b>work</b> <b>order</b> to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.|$|R

40|$|Enterprise {{resource}} {{planning systems}} and computerised maintenance management systems {{are commonly used}} by organisations for handling of maintenance <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> through a graphical user interface. A <b>work</b> <b>order</b> consists {{of a number of}} data fields, such as drop-down lists, list boxes, check boxes and text entry fields. In contrast to the other data fields, the operator has the freedom to type in any text in the text entry fields, to complement and make the <b>work</b> <b>order</b> description complete. Accordingly, the text entry fields of <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> can contain any words, in any number, as necessary. Data quality is crucial in statistical analysis of <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> data, and therefore manual analysis of work orders’ text entry fields is often necessary before any decision making.

It presents a simulation study of how WLC release methods behave in an assembly job shop where due dates are set by customers. In particular two alternative strategies to drive the release of <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> are investigated, namely: (1) assigning the same due date and different planned release dates to each <b>work</b> <b>order</b> according to the routing length of each <b>work</b> <b>order</b> and (2) assigning the same due date and the same planned release date to each <b>work</b> <b>order</b> according to the routing length of the largest <b>work</b> <b>order</b> in the assembly order. These strategies are compared and assessed {{on the basis of}} two primary performance measures, i. e. total throughput time and mean absolute deviation of the lateness.
