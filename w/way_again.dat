Only one boxing match is recorded {{during his time}} there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised by a doctor not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave <b>way</b> <b>again</b> and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters.|$|E

25|$|Although he did {{not hold}} her {{responsible}} for Alpha's loss, Sir Alan raised doubts about whether Lucinda was emotionally strong enough {{to continue in the}} process, after Jenny turned hostile against her by the halfway point of the task on the belief that she wasn't working fast enough, berating Sara when she stood up for her, while remaining hostile throughout the boardroom. While Jenny was lambasted for her many errors, including her lack of involvement in the pricing strategies, her appalling behaviour towards her teammates, particularly to Lucinda, earned her a warning she would be fired if she acted in this <b>way</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Below the lake, {{the river}} passes the hamlet of Perlethorpe, {{to be joined}} by the River Maun, flowing northwards, and here called Whitewater. The Robin Hood Way, a long {{distance}} footpath, crosses soon afterwards, and a weir creates two channels again, the south one deemed to be the Maun and the north one the Meden. They remain roughly parallel as they are crossed by the B6387 road near Bothamsall, a freight railway and the Robin Hood <b>Way</b> <b>again.</b> They diverge to the west of Markham Moor roundabout on the A1 road, pass under the road, and combine to form the River Idle. Just below the junction, the River Poulter swells the flow.|$|E

25|$|On 15 September, Seddon {{went to the}} {{undertaker}} {{and arranged}} a cheap funeral, keeping the small commission for himself. Barrow's burial {{took place in a}} common burial plot, although her family had a vault in Islington. Seddon's later explanation for this was that Barrow's family had snubbed his daughter during an earlier visit and he was not prepared to allow his family to be treated in the same <b>way</b> <b>again,</b> and that if Barrow's family missed the funeral it might teach them better manners for the future. Immediately after the funeral the Seddon family left for Southend for a fortnight's holiday. Barrow's cousin, Frank Vonderahe, suspicious over the suddenness of the death and how quickly the funeral arrangements had been made, arrived to take over possession of her estate. However, Seddon informed him that nothing was left as he had paid the substantial funeral expenses and the cost of Ernest Grant's upkeep himself. The Vonderahe family then went to the police and voiced their suspicions. Barrow's body was exhumed on 15 November 1911, and an examination of it by Sir William Willicox, the senior Home Office specialist, and young pathologist Bernard Spilsbury, who had already {{made a name for himself}} in the Crippen case, discovered about two grains of arsenic. As in the Crippen trial, Spilsbury showed himself to be an outstanding witness for the prosecution, easily dealing with cross-examination by the junior defence barrister and demonstrating highly effective forensic techniques.|$|E
