50|$|In females, {{measures}} of <b>Waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hip</b> ratio {{have been observed}} as an evolutionary sign of attractiveness and reproductive success. A females waist being smaller than her hips by a ratio of 0.7 is considered most attractive as it indicated readiness {{to give birth to}} offspring, and overall health to ensure survival of offspring. <b>Waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio is determined by an individual's proportions of android fat and gynoid fat. A small <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio indicates less android fat, high <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio's indicate high levels of android fat.|$|E

50|$|Women focus {{primarily}} on the ratio waist to chest or more specifically waist to shoulder. This {{is analogous to the}} <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio (WHR) that men prefer. Key body image for a man in the eyes of a woman would include big shoulders, chest, and upper back, and a slim waist area. Research has additionally shown that college males had a better satisfaction with their body than college females. The research also found that when a college female's <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio went up, their body image satisfaction decreased. The results indicate that males had significantly greater body image satisfaction than did females.|$|E
40|$|Regional fat {{distribution}} {{is an important}} risk factor {{for the development of}} diabetes and hypertension in white females; those with fat cells in {{the upper part of the}} body have a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension than those with similar degrees of obesity in the lower parts of the body. Whether this observation is relevant for the general population of black females is not known. In this article, we report the results of a study of fat distribution in black females and its correlation with the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. One hundred black females who attend the Charity Hospital System of Louisiana were studied. Anthropometric measurements were taken, and the prevalence of both diabetes and hypertension determined by review of the medical record and patient interview. In this study, the <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio was the index of fat distribution. <b>Waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio was found to increase with age. The observed prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and both together was higher in those with upper body obesity: 40 % of those in the lower quartile had diabetes, whereas 80 % of those in the highest quartile had diabetes. The mean <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> of diabetic patients (0. 95) was higher than the ratio for nondiabetics (0. 90). Hypertensives also had a higher ratio (0. 95) than nonhypertensives (0. 89). This is the first study <b>to</b> show that <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio in blacks correlates with the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. This suggests that the measurement of <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio is an important part of the physical evaluation and may be a predictor of morbidity.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{relation}} between the <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio (WHR) and the distribution of adipose tissue in visceral or subcutaneous site through the use of CAT. Results are expressed as the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area (VSR). A total of 61 patients were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Contrary to normal weight subjects, obese patients did not reveal significant correlations between the two ratios. Following multi-variant analysis in normal weight subjects, WHR appeared to be influenced by sex, BMI and VSR. In patients with prevalently visceral adiposity WHR was determined by sex and VSR, whereas in patients with prevalently subcutaneous adiposity it was influenced by BMI alone. In conclusion, the significant correlations between WHR and tomographic indices of adipose tissue distribution reported in the literature are not present in all types of patient, and in particular are not found in obese patients and normal weight subjects with prevalently subcutaneous adiposity...|$|R

50|$|Females {{have been}} found to desire males that are normal weight and have the average WHR for a male. Females view these males as {{attractive}} and healthy. Males who had the average WHR but were overweight or underweight are not perceived as attractive to females. This suggests that WHR is not a major factor in male attractiveness, but a combination of body weight and a typical male WHR seem to be the most attractive. Research has shown that men who have a higher <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and a higher salary are perceived as more attractive to women.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{concern is}} reverse {{causation}} due to illness-induced weight loss. That is, {{it may not}} be low BMI that is causing death (and thereby making obesity seem protective) but rather imminent death causing low BMI. Indeed, unintentional weight loss is an extremely significant predictor of mortality. Sick individuals often undergo weight loss before death, and classifying those individuals as lean greatly inflates the mortality rate in the normal and underweight categories of BMI, while lowering the risk in the higher BMI categories. Studies that employ strategies to reduce reverse causation such as excluding sick individuals at baseline and introducing time lag to exclude deaths at the beginning of follow-up have yielded estimates of increased risk for body mass indices above 25 kg/m2. Critics of the [...] "paradox" [...] have also argued that studies supporting its existence almost always use BMI as the only measure of obesity. However, because BMI is an imperfect method of measuring obesity, critics argue that studies using other measures of obesity in addition to BMI, such as waist circumference and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio, render the existence of the [...] "paradox" [...] questionable.|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{eight women}} {{presenting}} for routine computed tomography had their waist, hip, and thigh circumferences measured. The {{ratio of the}} area of intra-abdominal fat {{to the area of}} subcutaneous fat shown in the computed tomogram taken at the umbilical level was calculated and found to correlate highly significantly with the ratio of <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference. The correlation between these two ratios remained significant after allowing for the degree of obesity (weight (kg) /height (m) 2) and age. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the ratio of intra-abdominal to subcutaneous fat and degree of obesity. A high ratio of <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference {{has been shown to be}} associated with a high proportion of intra-abdominal fat. Thus women with a centralised distribution of fat (high <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio: "apples") tend to have a greater proportion of their fat in the intra-abdominal depot than do women with a peripheral fat distribution (low <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio: "pears"). The metabolic complications of obesity, which are associated with a high ratio of <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference, may therefore relate specifically to the amount of intra-abdominal fat...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is {{a complex}} {{gynecological}} and endocrinological disorder affecting 6 % to 21 % of reproductive age women. The main characteristics of PCOS include hyperandrogenism, irregular menstrual cycles, lack of ovulation, enlarged ovaries with numerous cysts and infertility. Symptoms vary widely between women, but most commonly include obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (approximately 65 % to 70 % of women with PCOS). Therefore, uniform therapy and dietary recommendations fail. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the quality of diet and dietary patterns of women with PCOS. Actual lifestyle habits and the diet of the women with PCOS have not been extensively researched internationally and never in Croatia. Methods: The study included women of reproductive age diagnosed with PCOS (N= 12), recruited at the Gynecological Office Lončar, Karlovac, Croatia. Study participants completed a general questionnaire on socio-economic characteristics and two questionnaires regarding their gynecological health and PCOS symptoms. Anthropometry was measured (Seca) while biochemical data was provided by the gynecologist. Diet quality was assessed with a 24 -hour dietary recall and quality of diet and exercise habits were assessed with a questionnaire developed specifically for this study. Results: Women with PCOS had an average daily energy intake of 82. 3 % of the RDA, i. e. 2333 kcal/day. When analyzing the contribution of separate macronutrients to that daily energy intake, discrepancies from the recommendations were found. The main discrepancies are high contribution of fats (40. 1 %) and increased intake of proteins (17. 7 %). Total fat intake showed a statistically significant positive correlation with waist circumference and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hips</b> ratio. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was found between age and intake of total carbohydrates and plant proteins. Conclusion: Study findings show the potential for a larger-scale study on Croatian women with PCOS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Obesity is a {{fast growing}} {{problem in the}} {{developing}} countries like India and is now known {{to be associated with}} increased health risk. Realizing the fact that the obesity in adolescent age group does not receive the deserved attention in the prevention and control programme, the present study was undertaken on 585 adolescent subjects studying in one college and three schools. Aims and Objectives: 1. To study the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adolescent population. 2. To find the association of body mass index (BMI) with important parameters like skin fold thickness, waist circumference and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio. Methods: It was a cross sectional observational study. The study population was school and college going adolescents in the age group of 11 - 19 years. The estimated sample size for present study is 585 students. The subjects were screened by body mass index, skin fold thickness, waist circumference and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19. 14 % and 4. 44 % respectively. It was found that there was strong association between the waist circumference with overweight and obesity. Similarly a strong association between <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio with overweight and obesity has been found. Also it was found that there was a strong association between skin fold thickness with overweight and obesity. Skin-fold thickness has more sensitivity as compared to waist circumference and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio. <b>Waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio has got maximum specificity amongst all but when both sensitivity and specificity criteria are considered together waist circumference stands out.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the anthropometric {{parameters}} of type 2 diabetic patients. The anthropometric parameters were determined. The {{data were collected from}} the subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Gorgan, Iran. Insulin sensitivity, waist circumference, <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio, fasting insulin and beta cell function were higher in males than in females, but the females had a higher body fat percent and hip circumference than the males. The waist circumference was found to correlate positively and significantly with BMI, the <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and body fat percentage in diabetic females and males. There was a correlation between the waist circumference and hip circumference in diabetic females. The waist circumference very highly correlated with the body fat percent and the <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio was likely to behave similarly in diabetes prediction. The body mass index, despite having a lower correlation with waist circumference, appears to have the same ability to predict diabetes as do both the body fat percentage and the <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{associations}} of {{low back pain}} symptoms with waist circumference, height, <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and body mass index, and to test the interactions between (1) waist circumference and height, and (2) <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and body mass index. SETTING: Cross-sectional study set in The Netherlands of {{a random sample of}} 5887 men and 7018 women aged 20 - 60 y. RESULTS: The prevalences of low back pain in {{men and women in the}} past 12 months were 46 % and 52 %, of whom 17 % and 21 % had low back pain for a total of 12 or more weeks, and 13 % and 18 % had symptoms suggestive of intervertebral disc herniation. After adjustments for age, smoking and education, more women in the highest tertile of waist circumference reported low back pain in the past 12 months (odds ratio = 1. 2, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 - 1. 4), low back pain for a total of 12 or more weeks (odds ratio = 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 3 - 1. 8), and intervertebral disc herniation symptoms (odds ratio = 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 - 1. 6) than women in the lowest waist tertile. Corresponding values of low back pain symptoms for women with high body mass index or high <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio were similar to those with high waist. There were no significant differences between men in different tertiles of waist, <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio or body mass index reporting low back pain symptoms. Tallest subjects did not report low back pain symptoms more often than shortest subjects. There was no significant interactions between waist and height or between <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and body mass index on low back pain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Women who are overweight or with a large waist have a significantly increased likelihood of low back pain. There are no significant interactions between waist and height, or <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio and body mass index on low back pain symptoms...|$|E

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of two exercise programs, whole body vibration and resistance training on bone mineral density (BMD) and anthropometry in obese postmenopausal women. Material and Methods. Eighty Egyptian obese postmenopausal women were enrolled in this study; their age ranged from 50 to 68 years. Their body mass index ranged (30 – 36 [*]kg/m 2). The exercise prescription consisted of whole body vibration (WBV) and resistance training. Bone mineral density (BMD) and anthropometrical parameters were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study. Changes from baseline to eight months in BMD and anthropometric parameters were investigated. Results. BMD at the greater trochanter, at ward's triangle, and at lumbar spine were significantly higher after physical training, using both WBV and resistive training. Moreover, both exercise programs were effective in BMI and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> the <b>hip</b> ratio. Simple and multiple regression analyses showed significant associations between physical activity duration and BMD at all sites. The highest values of R 2 were found for the models incorporating WBV plus BMI. Conclusion.

In this study, anthropometric indices and effective nutrients were assessed in the development and exacerbation of hypertension in postmenopausal women with a history of hypertension. Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 211 postmenopausal women with high blood pressure in Qom province. First, weight, height, and <b>waist</b> circumference <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference ratio, were measured. Food intake of the subjects was recorded by the 24 -hour dietary recall. Nutritionist 4 software was used to determine nutrient intake, and was compared with recommended daily allowances (RDA). Data were analyzed using independent and dependent t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficient. The significance level was considered p< 0. 05. Results: In this study, the mean protein intake was 58. 5 g (123 % RDA) and carbohydrate was 201. 5 g (155 % RDA). 12. 3 g (one quarter or 25 %) of fat intake was saturated fat. The mean sodium intake was 1268. 5 mg (98 % RDA) and the mean intake of potassium was 1779 mg (only 37 % of RDA). The mean daily intake of calcium was 451 mg (37 % RDA). Ninety percent of the subjects had abdominal obesity and 75 % were overweight and obese.

Methods: This study was a case control study and included 108 Trinidadian subjects (aged 15 &ndash; 60 years) of which 30 were healthy individuals, 38 had type 2 diabetes, and 40 were of type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. Blood pressure and <b>waist</b> <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> ratio were recorded. Fasting venous blood samples and urine samples were collected from all the subjects. Blood samples were analysed for the glucose, C-reactive protein, and sialic acid. Urine sample was analysed for microalbumin and sialic acid. Results: Urinary microalbumin was higher among diabetic subjects (28. 9 &plusmn; 30. 3 mg/L) compared with controls (8. 4 &plusmn; 10. 2 mg/L) and was significantly higher in diabetic patients with nephropathy (792. 3 &plusmn; 803. 9 mg/L). Serum sialic acid was higher in subjects with diabetic nephropathy (71. 5 &plusmn; 23. 3 mg/dL) compared to diabetics (66. 0 &plusmn; 11. 7 mg/dL) and controls (55. 2 &plusmn; 8. 3 mg/dL).

Abstract Introduction: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a chronic disease, it’s prevalence {{is very high}} and is increasing recently. In this study, in addition to determining type II diabetes related factors, we compared the generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models. Methods: Data is related to research project to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of diabetes in adults aged 30 years and older {{in the province of}} Yazd. In this study, 2, 795 people were screened with a blood glucose test for diabetes. We for data analysis by the mixed logistic and ordinary logistic regression used the R software. Results: In this study,four variables of family history of diabetes, age, body mass index and <b>waist</b> circumference <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference were significant in both models (p-value <. 001). Job was a significant variable in the ordinary logistic regression model in level significant. 1 but not significant in the mixed logistic regression model. The education, area of housing and gender not significant in neither logistic mixed model nor ordinary logistic model. According to the values of the odds ratio also, we saw quite differences between the two models. Judging from standard error of the coefficients and comparison of the their values in both models seen underestimate in ordinary logistic regression model Conclusion: The use of generalized linear mixed models lead to more accurate results and prevents underestimated standard error of the coefficients...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{physical}} activity in preventing CVD has been highlighted by Professor Jerry Morris in the 1950 ’s. We report outcome of a 15 -year prospective study with the aim to identify whether physical activity showed cardiovascular benefit independent of common risk factors and of central obesity. Baseline data of 8662 subjects, with no previous history of heart disease, diabetes or stroke, were obtained from an age- and gender- stratified sample of adults in Australian capital cities and were linked with the National Death Index to determine the causes of death of 610 subjects who had died to 31 December 2004. The study consisted of 4175 males (age 42. 3 ± 13. 1 years) and 4487 females (age 42. 8 ± 13. 2 years). Fasting serum lipid levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and smoking habits at baseline were recorded. The Framingham Risk Scores of 15 -year mortality due to CHD and CVD were calculated using established equations. Subjects were also asked if they engaged in vigorous exercise, less vigorous exercise or walk for recreation and exercise in the past 2 weeks. Subjects in the high recreational physical activity category were 0. 16 (0. 06 – 0. 43; p< 0. 001) and 0. 12 (0. 03 – 0. 48; p = 0. 003) times as likely as subjects in the low category for CVD and CHD mortality respectively. After adjusting for both the Framingham Risk Score and central obesity (<b>Waist</b> circumference <b>to</b> <b>Hip</b> circumference Ratio), those in the high recreational physical activity group were 0. 35 (0. 13 – 0. 98) times less likely compared to the low category for CVD mortality. Recreational physical activity independently predicted reduced cardiovascular mortality over fifteen years. A public health focus on increased physical activity and preventing obesity is required {{to reduce the risk}} of CVD and CHD...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} in non-invasive markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in clinical practice because liver biopsy is performed only for certain indications. Aim. Improvement of prognostication diagnosis of NAFLD in {{men and women of the}} first mature age by defining a set of anthropometric parameters of patients, who are under examination for various reasons. Materials and methods. We examined 112 patients of the first mature age with NAFLD. The diagnosis was based on a comprehensive analysis of complaint data physical examination, laboratory and instrumental studies. The control group included 225 healthy urban men and women of similar age taken from the bank of the materials from research center of National Pirogov Memorial Medical University, Vinnytsya. All anthropometric survey conducted by the scheme V. Bunak. We used the method of stepwise discriminant analysis to develop risk prediction NAFLD depending on the characteristics of the body structure. Results. Discriminant replaceable between healthy and sick men and women were the following anthropometric indicators: body mass index, waist circumference, <b>hip</b> circumference, <b>waist</b> circumference <b>to</b> <b>hip</b> circumference, chest circumference as an exhalation, height of supragastral point, difference between the height of the supragastral point and the height of the pubic Points, determination of muscle mass by Matejko. By using discriminant analysis was established discriminant function for predicting the presence NAFLD of individuals who investigated for checkups. Conclusion. The new NAFLD anthropometric diagnostic criteria for men and women of the first mature age of Podolskyi region could help to suspect the desease even at the first examination of the patient. Gender differences in anthropometric criteria NAFLD patients were identified. Anthropometric criteria can be used to diagnose NAFLD during preventive examinations, family doctor visits and outpatient examination of people. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; diagnosis; anthropometry; discriminant analysis...|$|R
