25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E

25|$|A magic {{ring that}} {{provides}} invulnerability to death is encountered {{not only in}} this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois. In a 12th-century romance Floris and Blancheflour, Floris's mother gives her son a ring when he departs, disguised as a merchant, {{to look for the}} maiden Blancheflour, whose tomb he has just seen to be empty. ‘Take this ring, son. <b>While</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wearing it, you need fear nothing. Fire will not burn you, the sea will not drown you and steel {{will not be able to}} cut you,' she urges him. And the boy Perceval, in the Middle English romance Sir Perceval of Galles, steals a ring from the finger of a sleeping maiden, and only after having travelled to a Land of Maidens and defeated an entire Saracen army singlehandedly, does he learn that it is a magic ring that confers invulnerability to its wearer. In the late-14th century Middle English alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Gawain refuses the offer of a ring from Sir Bertilak's amorous wife before accepting, instead, another circular adornment, a girdle, that will protect him from ever being killed, and which he wears when he goes to suffer a return stroke of the axe from the Knight of the Green Chapel.|$|E
500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v. Arizona (the Miranda ruling) states that [...] " [...] heavy burden rests on the government {{to demonstrate that the}} defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." [...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> being questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied {{at any time in the}} questioning if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1173, Peter went to England {{to take up}} a post {{as chief}} letter-writer for Richard of Dover, Becket's {{successor}} as Archbishop. He also entered the service of Henry II, acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with Louis VII of France and the Papacy. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to [...] "deplore publicly and regretfully that, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a most prudent woman, you have left your husband."

2500|$|It was not {{originally}} {{the intention of}} the Mongol Empire to invade the Khwarezmid Empire. According to the Persian historian Juzjani, Genghis Khan had originally sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor: [...] "I am master of the lands of the rising sun while you rule those of the setting sun. Let us conclude a firm treaty of friendship and peace." [...] or he said [...] "I am Khan of the lands of the rising sun <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sultan those of the setting sun: Let us conclude a firm agreement of friendship and peace." [...] The Mongols' original unification of all [...] "people in felt tents", unifying the nomadic tribes in Mongolia and then the Turcomens and other nomadic peoples, had come with relatively little bloodshed, and almost no material loss. The Mongol wars with the Jurchens however had shown how cruel the Mongols could be. Shah Muhammad reluctantly agreed to this peace treaty, but it was not to last. The war started less than a year later, when a Mongol caravan and its envoys were massacred in the Khwarezmian city of Otrar.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
