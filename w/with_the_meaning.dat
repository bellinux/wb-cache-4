25|$|The Croatian {{equivalent}} to comrade is drug {{for males and}} drugarica for females. In the period between World War II and Josip Broz Tito's death in socialist Yugoslavia it was applied to almost everybody: teachers, officials, etc. Today it is not used commonly. It may be used <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of friend as in Serbian, but this use is far less frequent in Croatian. It is still used among far left organization members, and calling someone drug/drugarica may also be used ironically to denote someone's perceived radical leftism.|$|E

50|$|The third {{component}} of the identity control theory is comparator. The comparator compares <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> from <b>the</b> input <b>with</b> those from <b>the</b> standard and registers the difference between them. This compares <b>the</b> perceived <b>meanings</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> in <b>the</b> identity standard.|$|R
25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can provide us <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of a word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give {{the meaning of the}} word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
25|$|All German {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} Kormoran lowered the Dutch flag {{and raised the}} German war ensign before the order to fire was given, although general distrust of German claims, plus the statement in Detmers' autobiography that it took six seconds to raise the flag, decamouflage, and start firing, led to questions. Olson contends that in Detmers' original report, the 'six seconds' figure encompassed only the flag-raising, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> corrupted over time. Conversely, Frame considers the possibility as knowledge of doing so would have been limited to very few people. He cites {{other parts of the}} autobiography, where Detmers repeatedly asserts that he had committed no crime, while stating his fear of court martial, as indicating a guilty conscience.|$|E

500|$|One of Zenobia's {{inscriptions}} recorded her as [...] "Septimia Bat-Zabbai, {{daughter of}} Antiochus". Antiochus' identity is not definitively known: his ancestry is not recorded in Palmyrene inscriptions, {{and the name}} was not common in Palmyra. This, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of Zenobia's Palmyrene name (daughter of Zabbai), led scholars such as [...] to speculate that Antiochus {{might have been a}} distant ancestor: the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes or Antiochus VII Sidetes, whose wife was the Ptolemaic Cleopatra Thea.|$|E

500|$|The first {{texts to}} use [...] "tefillin" [...] are the Targumim and Peshitta {{and it is}} also used in {{subsequent}} Talmudic literature, although the word [...] "ṭoṭafah" [...] was still current, being used <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "frontlet." [...] "Tefillin" [...] may have derived from the Aramaic palal, [...] "to plead, pray," [...] a word closely related to the Hebrew tefillah, [...] "prayer." [...] Jacob ben Asher (14thcentury) suggests that [...] "tefillin" [...] is derived from the Hebrew pelilah, [...] "justice, evidence," [...] for tefillin act as a sign and proof of God's presence among the Jewish people.|$|E
500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} Allāh has been discussed extensively by classical Arab philologists. Grammarians of the Basra school regarded it as either formed [...] "spontaneously" [...] (murtajal) or as the definite form of lāh (from the verbal root lyh <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "lofty" [...] or [...] "hidden"). Others held that it was borrowed from Syriac or Hebrew, but most considered it {{to be derived from}} a contraction of the Arabic definite article al- [...] "the" [...] and [...] "deity, god" [...] to [...] meaning [...] "the deity", or [...] "the God". The majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory, and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism.|$|E

She decided that [...] "One has to struggle much because the return for good is evil, and evil reigns." [...] A.A. Mosolov, a court official, felt that Tatiana's reserved nature {{gave her a}} [...] "difficult" [...] character, but one with more spiritual depth than her sister Olga. Her English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, who later became a Russian Orthodox priest, disagreed and felt that religion for Tatiana was a duty rather than something she felt in her heart.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng, academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it. One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith. In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly (1977), Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is [...] "dishonesty" [...] and [...] "always involves a grave charge". This contrasts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness. Thus, an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts.|$|E
500|$|When {{deciding}} upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto {{considered a}} number of possibilities: Kuwa (クワ, [...] "hoe"), Kama (カマ, [...] "scythe"), Botan (ボタン, [...] "peony"), Enoki (エノキ, a nettle tree), and Kakashi (カカシ, [...] "scarecrow"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day. In keeping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two. Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, {{as is the case}} with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three.|$|E

Charles Darwin studied de Candolle's [...] "natural system" [...] of classification in 1826 when at the University of Edinburgh, and in the inception of Darwin's theory in 1838 he considered [...] "the warring of the species", adding that it was even more strongly conveyed by Thomas Malthus, producing the pressures that Darwin later called natural selection. In 1839 de Candolle visited Britain and Darwin invited him to dinner, allowing the two scientists the opportunity to discuss the idea.|$|E
