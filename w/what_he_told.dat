Soon after the wedding, he ran away from home {{to live with}} an {{unemployed}} student in Shaoshan. There he spent much of his time reading, particularly historical works like Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian and Ban Gu's History of the Former Han Dynasty, and political tracts like Feng Guifen's Personal Protests from the Study of Jiao Bin.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
5|$|Cobra {{was adapted}} into an anime series titled Space Cobra {{directed}} by Dezaki and Yoshio Takeuchi that aired on Fuji Television between October 7, 1982, and May 19, 1983. Terasawa himself participated on weekly meetings {{to discuss the}} screenplays, giving his suggestions to the writers to fix <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> was wrong or rewriting himself the screenplay. The episodes were released in eight DVDs and a DVD box set on October 25, 2000 by Digital Site in Japan. The series was released in Northern America by Nozomi Entertainment in two parts; the first was released on March 4, 2014, and the second one is available since May 6, 2014. In November 2015, the series {{was added to the}} Crunchyroll streaming service to be broadcast in the United States and Canada with English substitles.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the report, Davies' personal actions were challenged. The FBI, which had interviewed Davies several times and considered him a credible source, said the account Davies had given them was different than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> 60 Minutes. Davies stood by his story, but the inconsistency ultimately prompted 60 Minutes to conclude {{it was a mistake}} to include Davies in their report and a correction was issued.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Begg married, and {{in early}} 1998, {{he and his}} new family moved to Peshawar, Pakistan. An American counterterrorism {{official}} claimed that the CIA and MI5 suspected Begg had worked with Khalil Deek, who also lived in Peshawar at that time, to create a CD-ROM terrorist manual. Begg said in interviews that he had met Deek in Bosnia and later collaborated {{with him on a}} business enterprise to sell traditional Pakistani clothing, but said he had never met Zubaydah. Pentagon officials said this conflicts with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> interrogators.|$|E

25|$|Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan, advised his Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, {{that the}} United States was fully {{prepared}} {{to carry out}} this threat. He also warned his Prime Minister that Britain's foreign exchange reserves simply could not sustain the devaluation of the pound that would come after the United States' actions; and that within weeks of such a move, the country would be unable to import the food and energy supplies needed to sustain the population on the islands. However, there were suspicions in the Cabinet that Macmillan had deliberately overstated the financial situation in order to force Eden out. What Treasury officials had told Macmillan was far less serious than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{information}} regarding de Hory's early life comes from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> American writer Clifford Irving, who wrote the first biography about him. Since de Hory's success was reliant upon his skills of deception and invention, {{it would be difficult}} to take the facts that he told about his own life at face value, as Clifford Irving himself admitted, Irving himself being convicted of the crime of forgery for his fictitious biography of Howard Hughes that he attempted to pass off as genuine. De Hory claimed that he was born into an aristocratic family, that his father was an Austro-Hungarian ambassador and that his mother came from a family of bankers. However, subsequent investigation has suggested that de Hory's childhood was, more likely, of a middle class variety.|$|E

500|$|According to {{an account}} {{published}} by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted {{of his own}} heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and claimed he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone, which he reiterated {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, in spite of their circumstances {{and the fact that he}} eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. [...] Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of [...] "common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion [...] "extravagant moralism", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices. Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, [...] "more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} also {{important}} in the main story arc concerning the cracks in time and space. The idea of the crack {{was inspired by a}} similar crack in the wall of Moffat's son. As the crack reappears, several facts about it are revealed. In the episode, the Doctor speculates that they are connected to the fact that Amy could not remember the events of several previous episodes, as well as events in history that had occurred in [...] "The Next Doctor". He also discovers that the time explosion that caused the crack is 26 June 2010, which is also the original airdate of the final episode of the series, [...] "The Big Bang". Before the Doctor, River, and Octavian leave Amy and the other clerics, the Doctor briefly returns to console Amy and to ask her to trust him and remember <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her when she was younger; however, the Doctor in this scene is shown wearing his jacket, which he had lost to the Angels earlier in the episode, as well as a different wristwatch. It is revealed in [...] "The Big Bang" [...] that this was in fact the Doctor from later in his timeline, setting up events in Amy's past to try to help her remember him after he has rebooted the universe. River Song tells the Doctor she will see him again when the Pandorica opens; the Pandorica was previously referred to by Prisoner Zero in [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] and is revealed in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", which also sees the return of River Song.|$|E

He calls for a more welcoming atmosphere in our communities with less focus on administering the sacraments and on Church bureaucracy, which he finds alienating some of the baptized (EG 63), He describes this bureaucracy as self-referential with [...] "a kind of theological narcissism".|$|E

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> every Republican senator, but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... And I know the leader didn't lie." [...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E
