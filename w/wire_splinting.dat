40|$|A expansão rápida de maxila cirurgicamente assistida é um método eficiente no tratamento da deficiência transversa da maxila em paciente adultos. O objetivo deste estudo mecânico qualitativo foi avaliar por meio de modelos fotoelásticos de um crânio humano a simulação da expansão rápida de maxila cirurgicamente assistida, comparando três tipos de ancoragem, analisando a distribuição de forças, com e sem disjunção ptérigomaxilar. As ancoragens utilizadas foram: um expansor Hyrax com ancoragem em primeiros pré?molares e primeiros molares; um expansor chamado de Hyrax modificado, com bandas em primeiros pré?molares e primeiros molares unidos a um fio ortodôntico retangular que se estendia de caninos a segundo molar; e ancoragem óssea do distrator de Rotterdam. A análise fotoelástica qualitativa foi realizada utilizando?se polariscópio plano. Os três expansores apresentaram distribuição de tensões homogêneas pelas réplicas de crânio através dos pilares caninos, pilares zigomáticos e processos pterigóideos, se estendendo para regiões mais altas do crânio; O expansor Hyrax modificado apresentou melhor distribuição das tensões nos dentes e adjacências, com menor concentração nessa região que o expansor Hyrax. A ancoragem promovida pelo distrator de Rotterdam apresentou melhor distribuição das tensões com menor concentração nos dentes e adjacências do que os expansores Hyrax e Hyrax modificado. Após a simulação das osteotomias, ocorreu marcante diminuição de forças para as regiões superiores das réplicas de crânio. Em conclusão: A ancoragem promovida pelo expansor Hyrax modificado apresentou melhor distribuição das tensões com menor concentração das mesmas nos dentes e adjacências do que o expansor Hyrax; A ancoragem promovida pelo expansor Rotterdam apresentou melhor distribuição das tensões com menor concentração das mesmas nos dentes e adjacências do que os expansores Hyrax e Hyrax modificado; A realização da disjunção ptérigomaxilar resultou em diminuição da concentração de tensões pelo crânio independente da ancoragem avaliada. The Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion (SARME) is an {{efficient}} method {{to treat the}} transverse maxillary deficiency. The aim of this mechanical and qualitative study was to evaluate the distribution of stress throughout the skull, of three different expanders used in the surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME), using comparative photoelastic analysis simulating SARME with and without pterygoidmaxillary disjunction. The skull analogs were constructed in two halves, to allow the creation of nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, which were subsequently bonded. It was used three different expanders in the tests. The first was a standard Hyrax-type appliance, with anchorage at first bicuspids and first molars. The second was a modified Hyrax-type appliance, with anchorage at first bicuspids and first molars that was united {{by means of a}} passively adapted rectangular orthodontic <b>wire</b> <b>splinting</b> together cuspid, bicuspid first and second molars. The third was the bone-borne Rotterdam expander. The photoelastic analysis was done immerging the skull replicas in a tank of mineral oil and using a plane polariscope. All three expanders generated similar anterior and posterior fringe patterns along the canine and zygomatic buttress and pterigoid processes. The modified hyrax showed a wider distribution of the tension through the teeth, with a decrease intensity of the fringe patterns when compared with the Hyrax expander. The Rotterdam distractor did not showed tension lines at and around the teeth, resulting in better force distribution than the two others expanders. The simulation of the osteotomies of the SARME decreased the amount of fringe patterns throughout the skull analogs. In conclusion, the three anchorage evaluated did not influence the final distribution of tension throughout the skull; there were variation in the fringe patterns generated by different anchorages; the modified Hyrax-type appliance indicates less load over teeth than the conventional Hyrx-type; the Rotterdam distractor does not load teeth, keeping the patterns of force distribution in the skull analog; the pterigomaxillary disjunction makes the SARME easier and predictable, independently of the anchorage used...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} of the {{treatment}} and prognosis of a maxillary second molar exhibiting a complete vertical crown-root fracture. The buccal and palatal segments were widely separated by as much as 2 mm and were immobile. To restore this tooth, it was essential to bring the segments into close apposition. This was accomplished by application of orthodontic elastics to the tooth crown in combination with a <b>wire</b> <b>splint.</b> After approximately 1 month of continuous use of the orthodontic elastics, the dislodged segments were suitably repositioned close to their original positions. The tooth was then endodontically treated and restored with a cast complete crown. The restored tooth has been functioning well, with periodic periodontal maintenance, for more than 3. 5 years, indicating a promising prognosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{clinical}} study evaluated {{the success of}} two different splint materials bonded on periodontally treated mobile teeth. Methods: A total of 14 patients {{were included in the}} study. Patients were randomly assigned to the groups to receive either with or <b>wire</b> composite <b>splint</b> (WCS) or fiber-reinforced composite splint (FCS). Clinical periodontal parameters were performed and periotest values were recorded at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. Patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire after the splinting procedures. Failure types for the splints were categorized. Results: Baseline PI values showed significant decrease at 6 month follow up in the WCS (p= 0. 0019) and FCS (p< 0. 0001) groups and remained stable after 12 months (WCS; p= 0. 36, FCS; p= 0. 63). During the course of the study, PD and RD values exhibited no change between and within groups. Clinical parameters including PD, RD, PI and BOP were stable at 6 and 12 months follow-up period. In 6 patients (4 FCS, 2 WCS), reparable failures occurred during the observation period. In four patients (3 FCS, 1 WCS) splints failed completely and were removed. The periotest values of the failing teeth ranged between 47. 3 and 50. In 3 patients in the WCS and 1 patient in the FCS group, periotest values were ≥ 40 but no splint failures were observed. Conclusion: FCS tends to show increased mechanical limitations compared to WCS. Teeth with periotest values above 40 may be more prone to splint failures independent of the splint material. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present a simple technique for stabilizing a lingual fixed retainer wire in place with good adaptation to the teeth surfaces and checking for occlusal interferences prior to the bonding procedure. BACKGROUND: Bonding of an upper or lower fixed lingual retainer using stainless steel wires of different sizes and shapes is a common orthodontic procedure. The retainer can be constructed in a dental laboratory, made at chair side, or it can be purchased in prefabricated form. All three ways of creating a fixed retainer are acceptable. However, the method of holding the retainer wire in place adjacent to the lingual surfaces of the teeth before proceeding with the bonding process remains a problem for some practitioners. REPORT: The lingual fixed retainer was fabricated using three pieces of. 010 " steel ligature wire which were twisted into a single strand wire. Another four to five 0. 010 " pieces of steel ligature wires were twisted in the same way to serve as an anchor wire from the labial side of the teeth. The retainer wire was bonded using the foible composite. SUMMARY: The technique presented here for stabilizing the retainer wire prior to bonding provides good stabilization, adaptation, and proper positioning of the retainer wire while eliminating contamination of etched surfaces which might arise during wire positioning before bonding. This technique also allows the clinician the opportunity to check the occlusion and adjust the retainer wire to avoid occlusal interference prior to bonding maxillary retainers. This same clinical strategy can be used to stabilize <b>wires</b> for <b>splinting</b> periodontally affected teeth and traumatized teeth. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fixed {{orthodontic}} retainers have numerous advantages, {{but it is}} {{not known}} whether they can exert pathological forces on supporting tissues around the splinted teeth. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the inclination of the lower anterior teeth can affect dental displacement and also change the direction of occlusal loads exerted to dental and its supporting tissues. Methods Four three-dimensional finite element models of the anterior part of the mandible were designed. All the models contained the incisors and canines, their periodontal ligament layers (PDLs), the supporting bone (both spongy and cortical), and a pentaflex <b>splinting</b> <b>wire</b> placed in the lingual side of the teeth. Teeth inclination was considered to be 80 ° (model 1), 90 ° (model 2), 100 ° (model 3), and 110 ° (model 4) to the horizontal plane. The lower incisors were loaded with a 187 -N vertical force. Their displacement patterns and the stress in their PDLs were evaluated. Results In incisors with 80 ° of inclination, less than a 0. 1 -mm lingual displacement was seen on the incisal edge and a similar distance of displacement towards the labial was seen on their root apices. However, in models with 90 °– 110 ° of inclination, the incisal edge displaced labially between about 0. 01 and 0. 45  mm, while root apices displaced lingually instead. By increasing the angle of the teeth, the strain in the periodontal ligament increased from about 37 to 58  mJ. The von Mises stresses around the cervical and apical areas differed for each tooth and each model, without a similar pattern. Increasing the angle of the teeth resulted in much higher cervical stresses in the incisors, but not in the canines. In the lateral incisor, cervical stress increased until 100 ° of inclination but reduced to about half by increasing the angle to 110 °. Apical stress increased rather consistently in the incisor and lateral incisors, by increasing the inclination. However, in the canines, apical stress reduced to about half, from the first to fourth models. Conclusions Increasing the labial inclination can mostly harm the central incisors, followed by the lateral incisors. This finding warns against long durations of splinting in patients with higher and/or patients with reduced labial bone thickness...|$|R
