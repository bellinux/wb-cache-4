For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> goal is and we {{are trying to figure out}} effective ways to slow down or prevent it".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} {{considered}} by most reviewers as a success {{for being able to}} cover a controversial subject in an inoffensive manner. Jonathan Boudreaux for tvdvdreviews.com said, [...] "The Emmy-winning script by Larry David introduced the brilliant euphemism 'master of my domain' to our lexicon and helped the series to truly become must-see TV. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> episode is about, but the script never explicitly says it. 'The Contest' effortlessly takes a potentially incendiary subject and renders it utterly inoffensive yet hilarious." [...] He also said that [...] "The Contest" [...] was [...] "one of the series' most infamous" [...] episodes. Donna Dorsett from audaud.com commented on the refusal to use the word [...] "masturbation," [...] saying, [...] "If the word had been used, even once, the show would not have been nearly as hilarious. The episode was totally inoffensive." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E

2500|$|According to Bob Bruce of the Queensland Skeptics Association, astral {{projection}} is [...] "just imagining", or [...] "a dream state". Although parallel universes are mathematically possible, Bruce {{writes that}} the existence of an astral plane is contrary to the limits of science. [...] "We know how many possibilities there are for dimensions and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> dimensions do. None of it correlates with things like astral projection."

60|$|The {{predominance}} of a historic, {{instead of an}} abstract, school of political thought could have saved nothing. It could have saved nothing, because the historic or conservative organs and elements of society were incompetent to realise those progressive ideas which were quite as essential to social continuity as the historic ideas. The historic method in political action is only practicable on condition that some, at any rate, of the great established bodies have the sap of life in their members. In France not even the judiciary, usually the last to part from its ancient roots, was sound and quick. 'The administration of justice,' says Arthur Young, 'was partial, venal, infamous. The conduct of the parliament was profligate and atrocious. The bigotry, ignorance, false principles, and tyranny of these bodies were generally conspicuous.'[7] <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> court was, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> noblesse was, {{and this is what}} the third great leading order in the realm was. We repeat, then, that the historic doctrine could get no fulcrum or leverage, and that only the revolutionary doctrine, which the eighteenth century had got ready for the crisis, was adequate to the task of social renovation.|$|E

30|$|Thus, if <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{foliation}} is explicitly, {{we could}} then compute the extremal function u. However, {{at this stage}} many foliations are still possible, {{and not all of}} them correspond to the extremal function. Further work shows that one can develop a differential equation for a parametrization of the foliation, and the solution of that equation will give the sought-for extremal function. The equation is complicated and we will leave the presentation of this work to another paper. When p= 2, we recover the extremal function u discovered by Burkholder. When p≠ 2, the equation is complicated and it is not clear if explicit solutions can be found.|$|R

60|$|When she {{had washed}} him, Penelope told the beggar {{that she could}} no longer refuse to marry one of the wooers.

Axes of this shape have been found at Lacedaemon, where Helen lived, so <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> axes of Ulysses were like. When he was at home he used to set twelve of them in a {{straight}} line, and shoot an arrow through the twelve holes in the blades. Penelope therefore intended, next day, to bring the bow and the axes to the wooers, and to marry any one of them who could string the bow, and shoot an arrow through the twelve axes.|$|E
