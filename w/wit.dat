In view of the artistically affected family environment - father musician, mother painter, aunt Louise Japha (1826-1910) pianist, sister Agnes <b>Witting</b> (1863-1937) singer, brother Walther <b>Witting</b> painter - it does not surprise that Alexander <b>Witting</b> also painted sometimes and regularly made music, even beyond the narrow circle of family or colleagues.|$|R

5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events.

5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's <b>Wit</b> (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's <b>Wit</b> for The School Boy (1702).|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as jokes, puns, parody, <b>wit,</b> observational humor, or the unexpected effect of irony.

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes.

According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
