25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> in us, to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them out. We were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E
500|$|Thích Tịnh Khiết, the 80-year-old Buddhist patriarch, {{was seized}} {{and taken to}} a {{military}} hospital {{on the outskirts of}} Saigon. As commander of the III Corps, General Đính soon announced military control over Saigon, canceling all commercial flights into the city and instituting press censorship. Later, Thích Quảng Độ, one of the leading arrested monks, who later would become a leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, explained the protest strategy. After being released following the deposal of Diệm, he was asked why the Buddhist leaders had not fled to avoid arrest. He said that [...] "We had done nothing wrong; therefore we could not flee. If <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> <b>it</b> would have been an admission that we were guilty." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Convention" [...] was {{the fourth}} episode of the series written by the writing team of Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, and the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. This episode originally had a scene with Angela and Dwight in the office kitchen. Producer Greg Daniels stated: [...] "They had a couple lines, there was a pause, and then Angela said, 'I'm late', turned around, and left." [...] This would imply that she may be pregnant. The scene was cut because Daniels ultimately concluded, [...] "It was a big move, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> in a show that {{had a lot of}} other big moves. ... You don't introduce a C plot line of an illicit office romance {{and then all of a}} sudden have one of the characters get knocked up!" [...] Executive producer and show runner Greg Daniels had hoped to get Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman, and Lucy Davis from the original British Office series to appear in the episode as their respective characters (Gareth Keenan, Tim Canterbury, and Dawn Tinsley) but was unsuccessful due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only knows when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video. This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games (who also owned Sierra Entertainment), {{as well as the}} 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games (VUG, which had since been renamed Vivendi Games) and video game publisher Activision, forming the Activision Blizzard holding company. After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights. They've never seen it, they've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [...] He said, basically, 'If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it,</b> I would {{love to be able to}} reissue those old games.'" [...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this time I do not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white because you were supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> nice and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E

Sometimes when you listen back bits of it sound quite punk. I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. Some of Bowie and Lou Reed were very good and [...] Bolan of course. I suppose it {{had a bit of}} influence, but not a lot."– Knox from the Vibrators citing glam rock acts, {{including}} Glitter, as an influence on punk.|$|E
2500|$|Den of Geek gave an {{overwhelmingly}} positive {{review of the}} series giving it four stars out of five saying, [...] "It is the most consistent of the new series so far (in fact, of the show’s 45 year history)". They praised the special effects as never being better citing [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", [...] "Planet of the Ood" [...] and the finale as [...] "the epitome of what The Mill can do". They praised the acting talents of David Tennant and Catherine Tate saying, [...] "never have <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good...she [...] displayed such a fine grasp of character that even David Tennant was left slightly in the shade by her energetic, thoughtful, hopeful and achingly sorrowful (not to mention damn funny to boot) performance". However they criticised the familiarity of the Sontaran two-parter and the hollowness of [...] "Voyage of the Damned". Overall they said, [...] "series four was never anything less than stunning, there were no ‘lows’ it was all ‘highs’," [...] and praised Russell T. Davies. They summed up the series as [...] "astonishing".|$|E
