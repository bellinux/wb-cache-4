5|$|Abū ʿAlī Ṣāliḥ ibn Mirdās, {{also known}} by the laqab (honorific epithet) Asad al-Dawla ("Lion of the State") (died May 1029), was {{the founder of the}} Mirdasid dynasty of Aleppo, ruling between 1025 until his death. At its peak, his emirate (principality) {{encompassed}} much of the western Jazira, northern Syria and a string of central Syrian towns. With occasional interruption, Salih's descendants <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> Aleppo for the next five decades.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth was {{initially}} succeeded by his stepson Lulach, but Lulach ruled {{for only a}} few months before also being killed by Malcolm III, whose descendants <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> Scotland until the late 13th century. Macbeth is today best known as the main character of William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth and the many works it has inspired. However, Shakespeare's Macbeth is based on the Holinshed's Chronicles (published in 1577) and is not historically accurate.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Basil I to {{the throne}} in 867 {{marks the beginning of}} the Macedonian dynasty, which <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> for the next two and a half centuries. This dynasty included some of the most able emperors in Byzantium's history, and the period is one of revival and resurgence. The Empire moved from defending against external enemies to reconquest of territories formerly lost.|$|E

50|$|Fiachra Cáech (died 608) was {{the founder}} of {{a branch of the}} Uí Chóelbad dynasty of Dál nAraidi that <b>would</b> <b>ruled</b> the petty-kingdom of Eilne, in Ulaid, medieval Ireland. Fiachra was the brother of Fiachnae Lurgan, king of Dál nAraidi and over-king of Ulaid. This {{off-shoot}} of the Uí Chóelbad based in Eilne became known as the Dál nAraidi in Tuiascirt.|$|R

5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party <b>would</b> <b>rule,</b> and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.|$|E
5|$|After {{months of}} negotiation, John and the envoys from the Latin Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which was {{confirmed}} by Pope Gregory on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who would marry John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.|$|E

5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political opponents and lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E
5|$|Before Tiberius, {{the heirs}} of Augustus were {{the sons of}} Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They {{advanced}} through their careers at the same pace {{and were going to}} rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like the sons of Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> together.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E

5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 2006, Judge Christopher Droney {{stated that}} unless WWE {{gave him a}} good {{argument}} between then and the 25th, he <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> in favor of Lesnar, giving him a summary judgment. This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere immediately. WWE was later granted a deadline postponement. On April 24, WWE announced on WWE.com that both parties had reached a settlement. On June 12, a federal judge dismissed the case {{at the request of}} both legal parties.|$|E
5|$|The Brezhnev generation— {{the people}} who lived and worked during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile of nearly all Soviet bureaucrats over the age of 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. This generation <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev are prime examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|The Viceroy, {{trying to}} calm the criollos, gave {{his own version of}} events in a proclamation. He asked for {{allegiance}} to King FerdinandVII, but popular unrest continued to intensify. He was aware of the news, but only said that the situation on the Iberian Peninsula was delicate; he did not confirm the fall of the Junta. His proposal was to make a government body that <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> on behalf of FerdinandVII, together with Viceroy of Peru José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Governor of Potosí Francisco de Paula Sanz and President of the Royal Audiencia of Charcas Vicente Nieto.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E
50|$|According to the post-Avestan texts, {{following}} the death of Jam ī Xšēd (Jamshid), Dahāg gained kingly rule. Another late Zoroastrian text, the Mēnog ī xrad, says that this was ultimately good, because if Dahāg had not become king, the <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> have been taken by the immortal demon Xešm (Aēšma), and so evil <b>would</b> have <b>ruled</b> upon earth {{until the end of the}} world.|$|R

5|$|Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti {{believe that}} king Nynetjer, the third {{ruler of the}} Second dynasty and {{predecessor}} to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> two separate kingdoms, {{in the hope that}} the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay seal bearing his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.|$|E
5|$|In 951, the Later Zhou emerged, {{the last}} of the five {{short-lived}} dynasties making up the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The founding emperor of the Later Zhou died in 954 and was succeeded by his adopted son, who <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> with the name Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou. Shizong believed that the Liao dynasty was poised to invade the Zhou, and in 958 he launched a preemptive military campaign against the Liao, aiming to take the sixteen prefectures ceded to the Liao by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin in 938. Emperor Shizong died in 959, before his army had even met the Liao forces. In 960 the commander-in-chief of the Later Zhou palace guard, Zhao Kuangyin, usurped the throne, then occupied by Emperor Shizong's seven-year-old son, and proclaimed himself the founder of the Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric {{may in fact be}} identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that it was expected that he <b>would</b> <b>rule</b> East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|E
