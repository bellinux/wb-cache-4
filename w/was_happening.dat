5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> as soldiers returning from the occupied territories would report on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Kampfgruppe Auschwitz (Combat Group Auschwitz) was {{organized}} {{with the aim}} of sending out information about what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Sonderkommandos buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and {{it is unlikely that}} anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> across the width of the straits. What follows is more of a discussion than a definitive account.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the bikini {{can be traced back}} to antiquity. Illustrations of Roman women wearing bikini-like {{garments}} during competitive athletic events have been found in several locations. The most famous of them is Villa Romana del Casale. French engineer Louis Réard introduced the modern bikini, modeled by Micheline Bernardini, on July 5, 1946, borrowing the name for his design from the Bikini Atoll, where post-war testing on the atomic bomb <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{all of this}} <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> Arledge, who {{was also}} the {{president}} of the network's sports division, was presiding over ABC's telecast of Monday Night Football in his capacity as its executive producer. At the exact moment he received word of Lennon's death, the game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins was tied with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots were driving toward the potential winning score.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out. No one {{except the}} commanders {{knew of the}} plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light {{infantry}} with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage. The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.|$|E

5000|$|Former {{member of}} the Dutch {{parliament}} Ayaan Hirsi Ali wrote that watching Crossing the Line 2 was “like having a bucket of ice water being poured over my head...The more we pretend that this <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> somewhere far away, the more hopeless and helpless we feel. But this <b>is</b> not <b>happening</b> far away. This <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> on American campuses, British campuses, Canadian campuses.” ...|$|R
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided he needed to see for himself what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a {{motorcycle}} escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} understand what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, German Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, {{unaware of}} what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Germany, had been {{building}} up {{the strength of his}} forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Straits of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E

He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was one of}} {{the first}} goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He also {{was one of the}} first to raise his arm on an icing call to let his defencemen know what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> He perfected a stand-up, {{positional}} style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E

30|$|Theory can be {{considered}} as a light on social reality – illuminating what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and providing a rationale for understanding why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> (Tobin 2008). Since theory can address such questions it is a tool for interpretive researchers to seek to understand social life, from the perspectives of participants. The role of an interpretive researcher is to find out from participants what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and the rationale for what <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> A theoretical framework illuminates social reality, but it only shows what the theory is capable of showing. Different theories can provide different landscapes for what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> For example, theories about expressed emotions might give interesting accounts of facial expression of emotion, emotions represented by prosody, and use of gestures when emotions become excessive. However, as rich as these insights might prove to be they will be silent about more issues than they illuminate. As theories illuminate so they obscure. How do people act to restore harmony in their bodies when their blood oxygen is low, when pulse rate is high, or when body temperature rises? Narratives about mindfulness might be absent because participants are not aware that mindfulness is salient to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> – or they might not even know {{there is such a thing}} as mindfulness. Becoming aware of a particular theory that might have salience to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> affords seeing differently. Of course, if participants see differently there is a fresh stream of possibilities for action – depending on what they see and their value system in relation to what they see happening, they will act accordingly. That is, fresh ways of looking can expand action possibilities. Becoming aware of what participants previously were unaware of is a way of fracturing existing equilibria – akin to an intervention that can unsettle patterns of action in particular social settings. Ann Swidler (1986) noted that culture reveals itself in unsettled times – an insight that provides a rationale for interventions that expand theoretical repertoires, thereby enabling participants to reflexively engage with their lifeworlds – becoming aware of things they previously were unaware of, and making changes when and as they feel change is necessary.|$|R

5|$|The {{crossing}} was not {{secure and}} when the Germans realised something <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews. At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 men still waiting on the north bank. A small number of men tried to swim across and some {{made it to the}} far bank. Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached the safety of the south bank over the following days.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
