30|$|Indigenous <b>ways</b> {{of knowing}} and {{learning}} are described as relational and interconnected because they are seen from a holistic perspective (Steinhauer 2002).

This binary has impacted negatively on Indigenous parents and children because their <b>ways</b> of knowing have been depicted as inferior to Western <b>ways</b> of knowing. Indigenous <b>ways</b> of knowing are neither inferior nor superior to Western <b>ways</b> of knowing; they are a different perspective which needs to be acknowledged rather than trying to justify their inclusion in the realms of Western education (Brayboy and Castagno, 2008).|$|R
