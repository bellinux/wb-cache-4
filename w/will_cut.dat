5|$|Jim wanders back to Suzhou Creek. Along the way {{he hears}} news of Japan's {{surrender}} {{and the end of}} the war. He encounters the Japanese teenager he befriended earlier, who has since become a pilot but is now disillusioned. The youth remembers Jim and offers him a mango, and <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> it for him with his katana. Basie reappears with a group of armed Americans who have arrived to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Basie offers to help Jim find his parents, but Jim—infuriated over his friend's death—chooses to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

5|$|While Bauer {{performs}} {{missionary work}} at the Okavango school in Sangala owned by Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), U.S. embassy official Frank Trammel (Gil Bellows) serves him a subpoena {{to appear before the}} Senate regarding torture charges, but Bauer refuses to go. Upon hearing the embassy <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> funding to Benton's school if it continues to protect him, he decides to leave. Meanwhile, several children playing soccer are ambushed by Juma's rebel soldiers and kidnapped for conscription. When two boys run away, the soldiers open fire, killing one. Benton learns that the rebels are planning to attack his school. He calls Bauer, who hides the children in an underground shelter, and kills several rebels before getting captured and tortured. Benton is able to ambush the remaining soldiers, and Bauer kills the leader, Youssou Dubaku (Zolile Nokwe). His brother, Iké (Hakeem Kae-Kazim) hears of his death and plots revenge, while Bauer and Benton leave with the children to get to the American embassy in the capital before the final helicopter evacuates the country.|$|E

25|$|Dowels and rivets are {{physical}} ways {{in which}} ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of wood, metal, or plastic. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive {{that is used to}} repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> through dowels with a piercing saw and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.|$|E

Finally, in despair, Raj asks his parents to find him a potential bride for an arranged marriage. Raj gets along well with his parents' first selection, but discovers that the woman is a lesbian trying to conceal her sexual orientation from her family: she assumes Raj is also homosexual and that they would have a lavender marriage, an idea Raj considers as a viable alternative to lifelong bachelorhood until Howard and Bernadette convince him otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The heroes {{enter the}} cedar forest. Humbaba, the {{guardian}} of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god Shamash sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. The monster pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers Gilgamesh to be king of the forest, he <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> the trees for him, and be his slave. Enkidu, however, is enraged and asks Gilgamesh to kill the beast, because he knows that Humbaba is lying. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with {{a blow to the}} neck. The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a gate for the temple of Enlil.

25|$|For {{her second}} slaving voyage, Will left Liverpool on 25 July 1799, {{with a crew}} of 42. She again sailed to Bonny. Near Cape Palmas a French {{privateer}} schooner fired on Will, but sheered off on meeting resistance. Then after Will had been at Bonny for some three months gathering slaves, Hugh Crow's brother Will, captain of Charlotte, brought the intelligence that there were three French frigates in the area. Next day, three frigates and a schooner came up and anchored some four miles away. They then sent their boats to attack Will. However, the tide was at half-ebb and the boats did not push over the Barleur bank, which stood between them and their target. After a two-hour long-range exchange of fire, <b>Will</b> <b>cut</b> her cables and returned to Bonny. There the nine ships in the harbour organized themselves {{under the command of}} Captain Latham of Lottery and sallied forth, anchoring in a line about four miles from the French vessels, which after a week gave up and sailed away.|$|E
500|$|The cat hurries {{ahead of}} the coach, {{ordering}} the country folk {{along the road to}} tell the king that the land belongs to the [...] "Marquis of Carabas", saying that if they do not he <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{is known}} for his skill at filming with {{multiple}} camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, [...] "Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera." [...] One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the gaffer, attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, [...] "Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he <b>will</b> <b>cut</b> it." ...|$|E
