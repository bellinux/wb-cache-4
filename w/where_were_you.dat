After the success of The Number Devil, Enzensberger wrote a follow-up, called <b>Where</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> Robert?, a children's book focusing on history rather than math. The German author has since stated he will not write any more young adult's books, but instead direct his effort towards poetry. Viva Media later published an educational computer game, similarly titled The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure, based on the book. An audio{{book was a}}lso released for The Number Devil.|$|E

500|$|According to John Lannert of Billboard magazine, Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and {{according}} to Thom Duffy also from Billboard magazine, it was the fastest-selling U.S. 1995 album. It helped Selena to become the fastest-selling female act in recorded music history, and has since been ranked among the best and important recordings produced during {{the rock and roll}} era. Dreaming of You joined five of Selena's studio albums on the Billboard 200 chart simultaneously, making Selena the first female act in Billboard history to accomplish this. The album was included on Michael Heatley's list titled <b>Where</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Whenthe Music Played?: 120 Unforgettable Moments in Music History (2008). Musicologist Howard J. Blumenthal said it [...] "would have made [...] a major rock star", and included it in his 1997 book The World Music CD Listener's Guide.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, Gambier's conduct {{has been}} criticised by historians {{ever since the}} battle, such as William Laird Clowes, who wrote in 1901 that [...] "there can be no {{question}} that affair of Aix Road was mismanaged by the Admiralty at home and by the Admiral on the spot" [...] and that [...] "a great naval commander never loses an occasion to attack when conditions are favourable to him." [...] In 2007 historian Noel Mostert wrote [...] "Oh Nelson! Nelson, Nelson, <b>where</b> <b>were</b> <b>you?</b> Never could {{the absence of the}} man from a scene of action clearly designed for his drive and decision have been more painfully alive." [...] In the same year David Cordingly wrote that [...] "The boldness of the attack [...] [...] [...] was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair." [...] Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy. Years later, Napoleon wrote to an English correspondent that Cochrane [...] "could not only have destroyed , [...] [...] [...] but he might and would have taken them out, had your admiral supported him as he ought to have done [...] [...] [...] The French admiral was a fool , but yours was just as bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film <b>Where</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? <b>Where</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> when you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews were {{generally}} positive. In a retrospective review, Christgau gave Janet an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} although the costly production by Jam & Lewis makes the music sound [...] "more pornographic than obscene", [...] "this achievement is Janet's, period ... Better nose than Michael, better navel than Madonna, better sex than either." [...] Laura Sinagra wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that with janet, Jackson [...] "took more risks" [...] lyrically than on her previous albums. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine notes that the album [...] "was {{at the forefront of}} the increasingly popular sampling trend in the '90s, with one song even employing three different samples as its foundation. Some make perfect sense on a thematic as well as sonic level, like Kool & the Gang's [...] "Kool It (Here Comes the Fuzz)" [...] and Stevie Wonder's [...] "Superwoman, <b>Where</b> <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> When I Needed You" [...] on [...] "New Agenda," [...] or the orchestral flourish from Diana Ross & the Supremes' [...] "Someday We'll Be Together" [...] on [...] "If," [...] which seems to exist for the sole purpose of providing the impetus behind one of the greatest dance-break routines in music video history." [...] Commenting on the album's broad range, he states: [...] "The mother of eclectic, genre-hopping records by Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, janet. incorporates new jack swing, house, pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and even opera, but the album's range of styles isn't jarring in the least... Janet has never been one thing and janet. is a feminist statement, to be sure." [...] Alex Henderson of AllMusic offered a positive review, saying [...] "nyone who expected Jackson to top Rhythm Nation—her crowning achievement and an incredibly tough act to follow—was being unrealistic. But with janet., she delivered a respectable offering that, although not as strong as either Control or Nation, has many strong points." ...|$|E
