25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (â€™) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people {{do not know how to}} enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of <b>Web</b> <b>publishing,</b> the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E
25|$|A web {{template}} {{system is}} used in <b>web</b> <b>publishing</b> to allow web designers and developers to work with web templates for the automatic generation of custom web pages, such as the results from a search. This allows for reuse of the static elements of a web page, while allowing the dynamic elements to be defined based on {{the parameters of the}} web request. Web templates are also used in the creation of static content, providing a basic structure and appearance characteristic for web content. It can be present in content management systems, web application frameworks, and HTML editors.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} {{and growth}} of blogs in the late 1990s coincided {{with the advent of}} <b>web</b> <b>publishing</b> tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and as such, early Web users tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that sense, blogging {{can be seen as a}} form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers. However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.|$|E
