6000|$|... "In {{my place}} would not {{you do so}} too? How can I help it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> of a sword? Of course you make me ask what the sword is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From your manner <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> {{to me at}} the door. Well, my dear, you've {{been quick}} about it, and I expect my visit last night helped it on--ha-ha! But I don't want to get him away from you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's all plain enough, now. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about {{notching}} {{ears and}} slitting noses I judged {{that that was}} your own embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've {{been acting}} {{all the time}} I've been here. Do you think I didn't see it was unreal, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> with such cynical indifference? I know you well enough to tell when you're hiding your real self behind a mask.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This extorted nervous shrieks {{from both}} of them. The Colonel heard a sound of scurrying feet, whisking drapery, and {{slamming}} doors.

Don't turn me out! <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> to your {{congregation}} of tortured and tempted people, you talked of Me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{what you}} were saying, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> of your {{experiences}}. These experiences do surprise one. I have knocked about the world a great deal, and would have almost said that nothing would surprise me. You {{are no more than}} a child to me, but you have surprised me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} it. You would bore the patriarchs <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked,</b> {{and when they}} talked they would shoot over your head. By and by you would say, 'Good morning, your Eminence, I will call again'-- but you wouldn't. Did you ever ask the slush-boy to {{come up in the}} cabin and take dinner with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Pemberton, {{you forget}} Miss Marie Laroche <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> {{of my being}} the pleasantest sight," [...] said Cameron, laughing.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{know you}} wouldn't {{be here if}} you hadn't. I wasn't going to say {{anything}} about it, but, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> of the Cosmopolis, I just had to. You lost your money in the same thing Jill Mariner lost hers, didn't you? I was sure you had, the moment I saw you here. Who cares? Money isn't everything!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{must tell}} you {{something}} else, Mr. Homos, and I hope you won't take it amiss. The first night <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about Altruria here, and showed us how you had come, by way of England, and the place where Altruria ought to be on our maps, I looked them over, after you were gone, and I could make nothing of it. I have often looked at the map since, but I could never find Altruria; it was no use." ...|$|E
60|$|MORRIS. You {{were right}} on the spot, Doc, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> about that red lamp of yours. That red lamp is the light of science that will put out all the {{lanterns}} of your turnip ghosts. It's a consuming fire, Doctor, {{but it is the}} red light of the morning. [Points at it in exalted enthusiasm.] Your priests can no more stop that light from shining or change its colour and its radiance than Joshua could stop the sun and moon. [Laughs savagely.] Why, a real fairy in an elfin cloak strayed too near the lamp an hour or two ago; and it turned him into a common society clown with a white tie.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well done, Lily, {{worthy of}} yourself,' cried Lord Rotherwood, laughing, 'but you know I am always off <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> poetry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how are you}} to know {{till you}} have taken the matter up and sifted it? But what you propose is Quixotic in every way. It will not hold water for a moment. You {{know as well as}} I do that no {{barrister}} would keep a wig on his head who pretended to such a code of morals in his profession. Such a doctrine is a doctrine of puritanism--or purism, which is worse. All this moonshine was very well for you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> of being a clergyman, or an author, or a painter. One allows outsiders any amount of nonsense in their criticism, as a matter of course. But it won't do now, Bertram. If you mean to put your shoulders to the wheel in the only profession which, to my mind, is worthy of an educated man's energies, you must get rid of those cobwebs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{forget that}} Friday is the St. Leonards' 'At Home' day. I've promised Janie that you shall {{be there in}} all your best clothes. (Don't tell her I'm calling her Janie. It might offend her. But nobody calls her Miss St. Leonard.) Everybody is coming, and all the {{children}} are having their hair washed. You will have it all your own way down here. There's no other celebrity till you get to Boss Croker, the Tammany man, {{the other side of}} Ilsley Downs. Artists they don't count. The rumour was all round the place last week that you were here incognito in the person of a dismal-looking Johnny, staying at the 'Fisherman's Retreat,' who used to sit all day in a punt up the backwater drinking whisky. It made me rather mad when I saw him. I suppose it was the whisky that suggested the idea to them. They have got the notion in these parts that a literary man is a sort of inspired tramp. A Mrs. Jaggerswade--or some such name-- whom I met here on Sunday and who is coming on Friday, took me aside and asked me 'what sort of things' you said <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked?</b> She said she felt sure it would be so clever, and, herself, she was looking forward to it; but would I--'quite between ourselves'--advise her to bring the children.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said, {{the stamp}} of the breed was unmarred, but there was yet a difference. There is a difference. I have watched it, studied it, {{tried to make it}} out. I have sat at table, proud by the side of you, but dwarfed. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> of little things I was large enough to follow; when of big things, too small. I knew you, had my hand on you, when presto! and you were away, gone--I was lost. He is a fool who knows not his own ignorance; I was wise enough to know mine. Art, poetry, music,--what do I know of them? And they were the great things, are the great things to you, mean more to you than the little things I may comprehend. And I had hoped, blindly, foolishly, that we might be one in the spirit as well as the one flesh. It has been bitter, but I have faced it, and understand. But to see my own red blood get away from me, elude me, rise above me! It stuns. God! I have heard you read from your Browning--no, no; do not speak--and watched the play of your face, the uplift and the passion of it, and all the while the words droning in upon me, meaningless, musical, maddening. And Mrs. Schoville sitting there, nursing an {{expression}} of idiotic ecstasy, and understanding no more than I. I could have strangled her.|$|E
