At the same time, ripples from past bounces affect its course.

25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach {{is the assumption that}} the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective <b>wave</b> <b>field</b> incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E

As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as astronomical interferometry. It was not until 1891 that Albert A. Michelson successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson & Francis G. Pease (1921) which was applied by their 20ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the 100 inch Hooker Telescope on Mount Wilson.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{generation}} solvers using Higher Order Spectral Method (HOS) {{have been}} validated and {{developed over the}} years. HOS solves nonlinear wave propagation in open sea (HOS-Ocean) and in numerical wave tank (HOS-NWT) with low computation time comparing with other nonlinear solvers. HOS solvers are released as open-source codes {{under the terms of}} GNU General Public Licence (GPLv 3). Nonlinear irregular wave generation in computational fluids dynamic (CFD) solvers becomes important recently in naval fiels to better estimate the loads on offshore structure. The conventional linear superposition methods imply a long computational time for wave generation and the simulation is made almost impossible without having enough computational power. And if the method is based on linear wave theory, there is also question on occurence of nonlinear phenomenon and the interaction between waves as the simulation goes. Therefore dedicated nonlinear wave solvers with high computational speed are needed.

It has also been shown that intensity patterns will be created at certain fractional Talbot lengths. At half the distance the same intensity distribution appears except for a lateral shift of half the grating period while at certain smaller fractional Talbot distances the self-images have fractional periods and fractional sizes of the intensity maxima and minima, that become visible in the intensity distribution behind the grating, a so-called Talbot carpet. The Talbot length and the fractional lengths can be calculated by knowing the parameters of the illuminating radiation and the illuminated grating and thus gives the exact position of the intensity maxima, which needs to be measured in GBI. While the Talbot effect and the Talbot interferometer were discovered and extensively studied by using visible light it has been demonstrated several years ago for the hard X-ray regime as well.|$|E
