40|$|AbstractCopper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} metals of modern times. The extensive usage from thin foils up to thick plates leads to a huge amount of welding applications. Basically the Laser Beam <b>Welding</b> is <b>suited</b> well for the welding of copper, because difficulties such as the high thermal conductivity can be overcome by high intensities. However in industrial applications, a sufficient process capability is currently only achieved at high welding speeds. This leads to low penetration depths and high demands in terms of laser power. At low welding speeds weld metal ejections, which cause critical defects occur. By Laser Beam Welding in Vacuum (LaVa) the process capability can be increased significantly. Weld metal ejections at low welding speeds can be prevented. By applying this process variation, high quality welding of copper at a low power level between 4 kW and 8 kW and a low intensity level between 50 kW/mm 2 and 80 kW/mm 2 of a multimode solid state laser becomes possible for penetration depths of 3 to 8 mm...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{welding process}} {{selection}} calls for extensive know-how {{which deals with}} {{a huge amount of}} knowledge. Hence, automation of knowledge through a knowledge-based system will greatly enhance the decision-making process. This paper describes a knowledge-base system developed for identifying the most appropriate <b>welding</b> processes to <b>suit</b> specific circumstances. Here, 30 welding processes of industrial importance have been incorporated into the system. In this study, only the product type and some of the process capabilities, namely material type, material thickness, method of use, quality level, joint type and welding position, are used to determine the best selection among competitive welding processes.

2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater <b>welding.</b> A boiler <b>suit</b> may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated diving helmet can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|R
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc <b>welding</b> is better <b>suited</b> for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltrasonic metal <b>welding</b> is well <b>suited</b> {{to realize}} {{aluminum}} alloy/carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) – joints. Beside monotonic properties the cyclic deformation behavior of ultrasonic welded aluminum/CFRP-joints was inves-tigated. Load increase {{as well as}} constant amplitude tests were performed with a servohydraulic testing system at a frequency of 5 Hz. The joints are realized by temperature induced softening and mechanical replacing the polymer out of the welding zone {{as a result of}} the ultrasonic shear oscillation. In contrast to conventional joining procedures this is the pre-condition, which allows a direct contact between the carbon fibers and the aluminum. By the fact that the carbon fibers are welded directly onto the aluminum it is possible to use the hybrid welds as their own fatigue damage sensors. Therefore additional to standard mechanical data, the change in the electrical resistance ΔR is moni-tored during the fatigue tests and used to describe the actual fatigue status in detail. The evaluation of the fatigue results shows that the change in ΔR is much more reliable than the change in the displacement amplitude measured by strain gauges mounted on the surface of the Al- and CFRP-sheets because of the direct response out of the joining zone itself. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A joint {{research}} project was directed towards {{the investigation into}} the feasibility of substituting currently used thermosetting resins for the encapsulation of electronic components by mouldable thermoplasts. Materials based on liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) appeared to be favourable in view of their excellent flow characteristics, inherent inflammability and mouldability. Initially tested materials derived from BASF developmental LCP exhibited sufficient thermal conductivity and low ion content levels. The additional requirements of stability towards hydrolysis and soldering as well as good welding line strength, however, were met only by blends of LCP with poly(aryletherketone) s (PAEK). Adherence of these materials to lead frame metal surfaces was investigated by a team of the Fraunhofer Institute of Applied Materials Research (FhG-IFAM). A minimised temperature difference between thermoplast melt and mould was recognised to be decisive for good adherence. The structural stability was significantly enhanced by introducing a polyimide layer between thermoplast and lead frame. The developmental materials were evaluated by SIEMENS for direct and indirect (premoulded packaging) sheathing. With direct sheathing using the LCP/PAEK blends ''wire sweeps'' were unavoidable. Promising results were obtained with the same materials under conditions of premoulded packaging techniques, among which heated tool welding proved to be the best <b>suited</b> <b>welding</b> process. High potential of the developed blends in system packaging is expected providing new prospects for the electronics industryAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1281 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOwing to {{its high}} strength-to-weight ratio, {{corrosion}} resistance and compatibility with carbon fibre composites, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{is a good}} candidate for the replacement of aluminium alloys in the manufacture of aircraft floor structure, whenever enhanced corrosion resistance is required. However forming and machining of Ti - 6 Al- 4 V is not straightforward and the cost of such an alloy makes rail manufacture from machining bars a non-viable solution. A better way to manufacture titanium alloy rails is to divide a rail into several components with fairly simple shape, which can then bejoined before limited machining to obtain the final shape. Laser <b>welding</b> is well <b>suited</b> for joining titanium alloys, as it is fast, precise and generates far less deformations than other welding processes. In this study, a 10 kW fibre laser was used for joining two different grades of 5 mm thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V plates. A comprehensive study taking into account on the laser process parameters and characteristics of both grades has been carried out to minimize distortion and to achieve sound and reproducible welds without oxide. The structure of each welded zone was examined both by optical and electron microscopy. Micro texture analyses were performed on samples before and after welding, in order to evaluate texture modifications. Differences in terms of mechanical properties, as shown by uniaxial tensile tests, were interpreted on the basis of base material initial microstructures as well as the microstructure of assemblies...|$|R
