5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day the light should be administered.|$|E
5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E

[...] Cubitt went on to state that [...] "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I {{will never be able}} to produce the idea" [...] and as such was [...] "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements".

500|$|Wenger's {{management}} skills at Strasbourg impressed many French coaches, {{and he moved}} to Ligue 2 club Cannes in 1983, where he became Jean-Marc Guillou's assistant. Earning a steady wage of Â£300 per week, {{he was responsible for}} collecting information about opposition teams, and instilled discipline in the players through training sessions. Wenger's commitment to football was well documented; when asked what the young coach did during his spare time, general manager Richard Conte replied: [...] "Videos, videos, videos. He was always watching videos of his opponents, of his own team. It didn't matter <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> night." [...] Cannes failed to win promotion to Ligue 1, but they reached the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France. Wenger's work in raising the standard of the squad did not go unnoticed, and in 1984, he accepted Aldo Platini's offer to become manager of Nancy.|$|E

(3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too?

2500|$|Nitrogen from soil {{gets into}} the water, and can be {{hazardous}} to human health. [...] EC Directive 80/778/EEC and 91/676/EEC both mention a ceiling acceptable level of nitrates of 50mg/litre, {{which is also the}} level recommended by the World Health Organisation. [...] In several places in Britain, particularly in the midlands and the south-east, nitrate concentrations occasionally exceed this level and the government has brought in regulations to control nitrate levels in the water. The regulations governing designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) aim to protect ground and surface water from contamination with nitrates and manure. [...] The Nitrates Directive was reviewed and expanded in 2008, and with the 2008 expansion, from 1 January 2009 around 68% of English farmland, 14% of Scottish farmland and 4% of Welsh farmland is within a NVZ.

2500|$|The {{site was}} used as a [...] "buffalo jump," [...] a place where American bison could be driven up a hill and over a cliff. Prior to 1700 CE, Native Americans lacked horses. Because they {{utilized}} dogs as hunting companions and for transportation, this time period is known as the [...] "Dog Days" [...] by many tribes. Bison served as a significant food source for many Native American tribes. Killing the animals, however, was difficult, as bison are notoriously difficult to herd or capture, and can be highly aggressive. Buffalo jumps were one way to kill large numbers of the animals at once without many of the risks associated with close-proximity ambush. Once the animals were driven over the cliff and incapacitated, they would be slaughtered and their meat, hides, and bones used by the hunters to feed and clothe their families and to make various tools and weapons. Jumps were rare, as ambush was a far more common killing method. There is conflicting evidence about <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> year the jumps were used most heavily. There is some evidence that bison kills usually occurred between early fall and early spring, but evidence of unborn and young calf skeletons at the site indicate that slaughter may have occurred year-round.|$|E

To nav-igate this tradeoff, we propose AMUSE (Adaptive bandwidth Management through USer-Empowerment), a practical, cost-aware WiFi offloading system {{that takes into}} account a userâs throughput-delay tradeoffs and cellular budget constraint. Based on predicted future usage and WiFi availability, AMUSE decides which applications to offload to <b>what</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the day. To practically enforce the assigned rate of each TCP application, we introduce a receiver-side TCP bandwidth control algorithm that adjusts the rate by controlling the TCP advertisement window from the user side.
