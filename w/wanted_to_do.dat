5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Dex, ace {{mechanic}} of the Flying Legion. Ribisi {{met with}} Avnet and, initially, {{was not sure}} that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the movie but after seeing the teaser trailer, he signed on without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|Geri {{came in and}} sang: 'Too much of something/Da-da-da-da-da...Right. OK. You got that?' We {{started working}} on it and we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some sort of doo-wop vocal thing. So we {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this was quite a good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E

5000|$|An artist should <b>do</b> {{everything}} he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> When {{he gets up}} in the morning and says, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a sculpture!" [...] he should be able to go out and do a sculpture. Next morning he can say, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> sculpture, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> print," [...] and then be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> printing.|$|R

5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|Development of MediEvil {{begun in}} late 1995 at {{independent}} developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{he said he wanted to}} work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E

6000|$|Dan Hewlett, with a horrid white face, {{was going}} about persuading the men, {{and so were}} others.

5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, and had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation {{was the best way}} to continue the world of Napoleon Dynamite as the original actors had grown too old to play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E
5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|The video {{reportedly}} cost £50,000. During the shoot, {{the video}} was documented by MTV; in the interview, Allen declared: I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a dance routine, even though I'm not really doing a dance routine, {{other people are}} doing it, but I'm part of it. I think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move {{in front of the}} camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E

5|$|We really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't {{trying to make a}} better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol {{but not more than}} three pills per day.|$|E
5000|$|Structurally, it {{uses the}} twelve-bar blues chord progression. As with several of KC's disco songs, some of the lyrics are playfully suggestive: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it till {{the sun comes up}} / I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> till I can't get enough." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{do not do}} {{the good}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but the evil I <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do—this I keep on not doing. Let me explain this slowly, I do not do the good I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (creating the good of a raceless society in its {{historically}} constituted terms, so, practically speaking, doing Dutch society’s reality of race differently), but the evil I <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (which is thinking and doing in terms of race)—this I keep on not doing (so not doing race at all).|$|R
5000|$|A key {{component}} of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan what materials they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and whom they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> they can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.|$|R
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Cristián Blasser and Mario Gutiérrez, {{students}} from the Escuela Consolidada de San Carlos (now Liceo Politécnico de San Carlos), and Sergio Rojas, {{who worked at the}} school, formed a band in 1968. Upon hearing an announcement of a bands tournament organized by La Discusión radio station from Chillán, they recruited Germaín de la Fuente, who was well known in the local scene for his vocal abilities. Blasser and Gutiérrez played the guitar, Rojas the bass, and De la Fuente became the keyboardist and lead vocalist. Most of the band members were musically inspired by acts such as The Beatles except De la Fuente, who did not like them at all and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> bolero music. As a result, they created a mixed style known as the Balada rockmántica or Bolero-beat.|$|E
40|$|Who {{knows what}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Who knows what anyone <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> How {{can you be}} sure about {{something}} like that? Isn't it all a question of brain chemistry, signals going back and forth, electrical energy in the cortex? How do you know whether something is really what you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> or just some kind of nerve impulse in the brain. Some minor little activity takes place somewhere in this unimportant place {{in one of the}} brain hemispheres and suddenly I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Montana or I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Montana.

6000|$|... 'I know,' said Dick. 'You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your fancy {{heads with}} a bunch of flowers {{at the base of the}} neck to hide bad modelling.' The red-haired girl laughed a little. 'You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> landscapes with cattle knee-deep in grass to hide bad drawing. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a great deal more than you can do. You have sense of colour, but you want form. Colour's a gift,--put it aside and think no more about it,--but form you can be drilled into.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think I'm devoured with ambition," [...] said Horne Fisher, in his rather {{listless}} voice, [...] "aiming at a dictatorship and all that. Well, I think I can clear myself {{of the charge}} of mere selfish ambition. I only want certain things <b>done.</b> I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them. I very seldom <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. And I've come here to say that I'm quite willing to retire from the contest if you can convince me that we really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same thing." ...|$|R
5|$|Cuarón <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{tracking}} shots, in {{part because}} the producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. He and his team put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the team.|$|E

[...] Regardless of the record charts, he is {{satisfied}} with his album just like his fans and supporters who really <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the music that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There were {{offers to}} play the role of a {{musician}} but I <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.
