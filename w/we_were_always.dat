While growing up, Hill frequently listened to Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and Gladys Knight; years later she recalled playing Marvin Gaye's What's Going On repeatedly until she fell asleep to it.|$|E
500|$|Though DeLonge {{hoped to}} retain the angst present in the band's past work, he wanted to [...] "deliver it in a package that's very modern, using {{instrumentations}} and formulas to launch you into different places with music that is not just three-chord pop-punk with riffs." [...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I {{think we should have}} been pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> like 'Blink is Blink, man.

500|$|In January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for {{a promotional}} trailer {{intended}} to advertise the animated film Yellow Submarine, {{loosely based on}} the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition. Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their self-titled double album, {{also known as the}} [...] "White Album". Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: [...] "We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> fighting [...] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own".|$|E
500|$|Genesis were {{targets for}} {{criticism}} throughout the 1970s {{from those who}} disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he [...] "grew disillusioned with their later excesses". Some regarded the group as overtly middle class, paying {{particular attention to the}} founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a [...] "people's hero" [...] musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, [...] "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> very straight about where we came from, and we were middle-class, not aristocratic". Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into something much more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope this time we can take the right tyres, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> {{a little bit on}} the wrong side – it’s not easy, but I hope we will manage to get it right this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|As teenagers, the Gallagher {{brothers}} maintained limited {{contact with}} their father {{in order to secure}} jobs in construction. However, the relationship between father and sons continued to be tempestuous; Gallagher said that [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> arguing we'd still be working at nine o'clock every night". Having left his father's building company, he took a job at another building firm sub-contracted to British Gas. There he sustained an injury when a heavy cap from a steel gas pipe landed on his right foot. Following a period of recuperation, Gallagher was offered a less physically demanding role in the company's storehouse, freeing up time for him to practise guitar and write songs. He claimed to have written at least three of the songs on Definitely Maybe in this storehouse (including [...] "Live Forever" [...] and [...] "Columbia"). He later called the storehouse [...] "The Hit Hut" [...] and claimed the walls were painted gold. Much of the late 1980s found Gallagher unemployed and living in a bedsit, occupying his time with recreational drug use, songwriting, and guitar playing. He is left-handed, but plays right-handed.|$|E
500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> brought back on". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} May, the Russo brothers, {{along with}} Feige and Pascal, held a screen test in Atlanta for six teenage actors that were being eyed {{for the role of}} Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the actors testing against Downey and Evans for [...] "chemistry"; Tom Holland was cast as the {{character}} the next month, to also appear in a [...] The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who we wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker in the comics, in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War, due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly. The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, [...] "were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on." [...] Holland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film, and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit. Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to [...] "see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it," [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, [...] "to make sure we were all on the same page so that [...] transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a [...] "plan B" [...] should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because [...] "it was very important to us to reintroduce" [...] Spider-Man in the film, adding, [...] "We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man." ...|$|E
