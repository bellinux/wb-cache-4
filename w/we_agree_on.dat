Then, as to churches themselves, she is in favor of building churches, and so am I; and schools--there is no quantity of schools I would not establish. My opinion is, you cannot have too much education, provided it be founded on a religious basis. I would sooner renounce the whole of my inheritance than consent to secular education." ...|$|E

If <b>we</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a two-state solution, we are offered bantustans. And if we say that in those conditions, we’d prefer a single, bi-national state, then we are accused of wanting to destroy Israel.” ...|$|E
