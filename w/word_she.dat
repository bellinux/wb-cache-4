5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private <b>word</b> <b>she</b> told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken <b>word,</b> <b>she</b> also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Neil Strauss, {{commenting on}} Love in 1995, noted {{that she had}} [...] "acquired a strange {{distinction}} reserved for Presidents, major felons and celebrity widows: every <b>word</b> <b>she</b> said and wrote became newsworthy. Her postings on the computer bulletin board America Online were repeated word for word in magazines; her arrests, scandals and the drug overdose of the bassist in her band, Hole, made national headlines." [...] Many journalists have labeled her the [...] "Yoko Ono" [...] of Generation X, comparing her relationship to husband Kurt Cobain to that of John Lennon and Ono.|$|E

500|$|Mariam is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in Herat, 1959 to a Pashtun father. She {{is the child}} of Jalil and Nana born out of the wedlock. She suffers shame {{throughout}} her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated {{in every sense of the}} <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> is a woman who is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants connection with another human being." [...] Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a [...] "friend and a doting alternative mother" [...] to her through the [...] "common hardship" [...] of being married to the [...] "abusive, psychologically imposing" [...] Rasheed.|$|E
500|$|Through her {{production}} company, IPC Films, {{she produced}} films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film Fun With Dick and Jane {{is generally considered}} her [...] "comeback" [...] picture. Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia, receiving positive reviews, BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination. During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> turned down An Unmarried Woman because she felt the part was not relevant. She won another BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with The China Syndrome, about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. The same year, she starred in The Electric Horseman with her previous co-star, Robert Redford.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked how}} she felt about Fey's portrayal, Sarah Palin replied, [...] "I watched with the volume {{all the way down}} and I thought it was hilarious... I didn't hear a <b>word</b> <b>she</b> said, but the visual was spot on." [...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch {{in the back of her}} plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E

500|$|Lord of Scoundrels was {{released}} in January 1995 by Avon Books, the same publisher that had released Chase's last two novels. According to Chase's website, the novel has been published in over fourteen languages. A Spanish translation {{was released}} in 2006, while a Japanese translation {{was released in}} 2008. Its e-book edition, published by HarperCollins, landed on The New York Times Best Seller list in August 2011. In 1996, the novel earned the RITA Award for [...] "Best Short Historical", a prize given annually by the Romance Writers of America. It also won the 1996 [...] "Regency Historical Romance" [...] award, granted by the Romantic Times. In a review by that publication, M. Helfer praised Chase for being [...] "an exquisite storyteller who creates sharply original characters and moves them in new and exciting ways. One of the true treasures of the genre, she epitomizes the essence of excellence in every <b>word</b> <b>she</b> writes".|$|E
500|$|Shikasta {{alludes to}} the Old Testament, Gnosticism and Sufism, and draws on several Judeo-Christian themes. Lessing wrote in the book's preface that it {{has its roots in}} the Old Testament. Her SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), the [...] "spiritual nourishment" [...] that flows from Canopus to Shikasta, is also a <b>word</b> <b>she</b> invented with a {{pronunciation}} similar to [...] "Sufi". A reviewer of the book in the Los Angeles Times said that Shikasta is a [...] "reworking of the Bible", and the Infinity Plus website draws parallels between the Canopeans and their emissaries, and God and his angels from the Old Testament. A New York Times reviewer wrote that the [...] "outer space" [...] where the Canopeans come from is a metaphor for [...] "religious or inner space". Thelma J. Shinn, in her book Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women, described the struggle between Canopus and Shammat, played out on Shikasta, as the [...] "eternal struggle between good and evil", and the [...] "Degenerative Disease" [...] that strikes Shikasta as a metaphor for the original sin. Lessing said in an interview that the final war (World War III) at the end of the novel is the Apocalypse. Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis wrote in The Journal of Bahá’í Studies that Shikasta is the [...] "symbolic rendering of the coming of a new prophet to an earthlike planet", and relates it to Bahá’í principles.|$|E
500|$|Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, {{were interviewed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the {{subsequent}} PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald, police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, Who Killed Leigh Leigh, which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as [...] "an inquisition on just about every <b>word</b> <b>she</b> had spoken [...] written" [...] in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.|$|E

500|$|One {{contemporary}} {{review of}} this book referred {{to the amount of}} specialized phonetic symbols and diacritics as a [...] "profusion of diacritical marks that is rather confusing". Pe Maung Tin responded to this by clarifying the diacritics were necessary to convey the interaction of tone and prosody and to ensure that English speakers did not read the texts with an English intonation. He also defended other transcription choices like using [...] "" [...] to represent an aspirated alveolar fricative as in the Burmese word [...] ( [...] , [...] "oil"), which Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin transcribed as [...] ""; the reviewer thought it was confusing to use [...] "" [...] to refer to a sound other than the post-alveolar fricative represented by the English [...] as in the <b>word</b> <b>she</b> (...) [...] R. Grant Brown, {{a former member of the}} Indian Civil Service in Burma, praised A Burmese Phonetic Reader for being the joint work of a phonetician and a native speaker, writing [...] "This excellent little book sets a standard which other writers on living Oriental languages will have to follow if they do not wish their work to be regarded as second-rate", although he thought their transcription system was [...] "too elaborate for ordinary use". British linguist John Rupert Firth used a broad transcription which he simplified from Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's system based in part on his experience using their Reader with Burmese speakers and with students of Burmese phonetics at Oxford's Indian Institute. Burmese linguist Minn Latt said their transcription system used too many [...] "unfamiliar symbols" [...] for an ideal romanization scheme. British linguist Justin Watkins used Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's translation of [...] "The North Wind and the Sun" [...] for his 2001 illustration of the IPA for Burmese in the Journal of the International Phonetic Association.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2017 she {{cancelled}} {{a planned}} tour of Australia. This followed the Facebook {{release of a}} video by six Australian Muslim women who accused her of a being [...] "star of the global Islamophobia industry" [...] and of profiting from [...] "an industry that exists to dehumanise Muslim women" [...] but did not call for her to cancel her trip. [...] Ali responded that the women in question were [...] "carrying water" [...] for the causes of radical Islamists and stated that [...] "Islamophobia" [...] is a manufactured <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> explained that the cancellation was due to security concerns and organisational problems.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's wit, quirkiness, and slyness {{are often}} noted by reviewers of her poetry, but Jack Foley {{emphasizes}} her essential seriousness. In {{his review of}} Say Uncle he writes, [...] "There is, in short, far more darkness than 'light' in this brilliant, limited volume. Kay Ryan is a serious poet writing serious poems, and she resides on a serious planet (a <b>word</b> <b>she</b> rhymes with 'had it'). Ryan can certainly be funny, but it is rarely without a sting." [...] Some of these disjoint qualities in her work are illustrated by her poem [...] "Outsider Art", which Harold Bloom selected for the anthology The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988–1997.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to {{the cellar}} at 25 Cromwell Street, {{where the child}} was ordered to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation. She was then {{stripped}} naked, bound to a mattress and gagged before Fred raped her with Rose's active encouragement. After the rape, Rose explained to the child: [...] "Everybody does it to every girl. It's a father's job. Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody." [...] Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, both Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received <b>word</b> <b>she</b> had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands.|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{she often}} floundered {{about what to}} do and how to spend her time ("drifting" [...] was the <b>word</b> <b>she</b> {{frequently}} used), always struggling with her many eccentricities, and her lifelong melancholy and moodiness. As she approached her sixtieth birthday, she told a frequent walking companion [...] "In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave {{me for the rest of}} my life." [...] To another friend, she said, in 1971, [...] "I suppose I suffer from very deep depression." [...] It is also arguable, says one biographer, that she was bipolar. [...] "I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me," [...] she said in 1933.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1979 {{television}} interview, author Mary McCarthy, long Hellman's political adversary and {{the object}} of her negative literary judgment, said of Hellman that [...] "every <b>word</b> <b>she</b> writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'." [...] Hellman responded by filing a US$2,500,000 defamation suit against McCarthy, interviewer Dick Cavett, and PBS. McCarthy in turn produced evidence she said proved that Hellman had lied in some accounts of her life. Cavett said he sympathized more with McCarthy than Hellman in the lawsuit, but [...] "everybody lost" [...] {{as a result of}} it. Norman Mailer attempted unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute through an open letter he published in the New York Times. At the time of her death, Hellman was still in litigation with McCarthy; her executors dropped the suit.|$|E

He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have Nino kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him [...] "until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot." [...] Neff does not believe a <b>word</b> <b>she</b> says, and as she hugs him tightly, Neff says, [...] "Goodbye, baby," [...] and shoots twice, killing her.|$|E
2500|$|Hellman's {{accuracy}} {{was challenged}} after she brought a libel suit against Mary McCarthy. In 1979, on The Dick Cavett Show, McCarthy said that [...] "every <b>word</b> <b>she</b> writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'." [...] During the libel suit, investigators found errors in Hellman's popular memoirs such as Pentimento. They {{said that the}} [...] "Julia" [...] section of Pentimento, which had been {{the basis for the}} Oscar-winning 1977 movie of the same name, was actually based on the life of Muriel Gardiner. Martha Gellhorn, {{one of the most prominent}} war correspondents of the twentieth century, as well as Ernest Hemingway's [...] third wife, said that Hellman's remembrances of Hemingway and the Spanish Civil War were wrong. McCarthy, Gellhorn and others accused Hellman of lying about her membership in the Communist Party and being an unrepentant Stalinist.|$|E
