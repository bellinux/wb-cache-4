5|$|The house's namesake is {{its first}} owner, Joshua Perkins, a farmer {{and son of}} the {{prominent}} Captain Matthew Perkins, a farmer and {{founding member of the}} Hanover Society. Ashlawn's main house has a five-bay front facade with pilasters supporting broken-base pediments. The inside has well-documented woodwork for its moldings and <b>wainscotting.</b> The house has integrated an older structure, likely a central-chimney structure built {{in the second quarter of}} the 18th century, as an ell.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine <b>wainscotting.</b> The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel <b>wainscotting.</b> All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Amos Avery donated 100 {{acres of}} land to the Mashantucket Land Trust and kept the {{surrounding}} 40 acres. Amos Avery also restored the house to a [...] "more or less" [...] 18th-century appearance through a decade-long restoration effort. The restoration effort began in the mid-1950s when he poked {{a hole in the}} ceiling and felt the molding, spurring his desire to see what was underneath. The ceiling was removed and the room was restored and then it moved to the next room. Avery removed plaster off the fireplaces, replaced the wide floor boards and replicated the <b>wainscotting.</b> Upon Amos Avery's death in July 1998, aged 96, the house passed to his oldest son Edward. Many historical artifacts were put up for auction, including 12 wicker baskets of Mohegan or Pequot origin, which were bid on by the Mashantucket Pequot Museum.|$|E
500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the <b>wainscotting</b> from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|Echoing {{the actions}} of Kent's {{previous}} landlord, Parsons had not repaid Kent's loan—of which about three guineas was outstanding—and Kent therefore instructed his solicitor to sue him. [...] He managed to recover the debt by January 1762, just as the mysterious noises at Cock Lane began again. [...] Catherine Friend had lodged there shortly after the couple left but moved out when she found the noises, which had returned intermittently and which were becoming more frequent, could not be stopped. [...] They apparently emanated from Elizabeth Parsons, who also suffered fits, {{and the house was}} regularly disturbed by unexplained noises, likened at the time to the sound of a cat scratching a chair. [...] Reportedly determined to discover their source, Richard Parsons had a carpenter remove the <b>wainscotting</b> around Elizabeth's bed. He approached John Moore, assistant preacher at St Sepulchre's since 1754 and rector of St Bartholomew-the-Great in West Smithfield since June 1761. [...] The presence of one ghost, presumed to belong to Fanny's sister, Elizabeth, had already been noted while Fanny lay dying, and the two concluded that the spirit now haunting Parsons' house must be that of Fanny Lynes herself. [...] The notion that a person's spirit might return from the dead to warn those still alive was a commonly held belief, and the presence of two apparently restless spirits was therefore an obvious sign to both men that each ghost had an important message to disclose.|$|E

500|$|Francis Mansell, who was {{appointed}} principal in 1630, raised hundreds of pounds from donors towards {{the building of a}} second quadrangle in 1640. Buildings along part of the north and south sides were completed at this time, and in 1638 he purchased some land known as Coggan's Garden adjoining Market Street for £90, upon which much of {{the west side of the}} second quadrangle was later built. The college also unsuccessfully proposed to the city council in 1638 that it should be permitted to expand to the north by closing Ship Street and purchasing the council's properties there. According to his successor and biographer, Sir Leoline Jenkins, Mansell had sufficient benefactors to be able to complete the quadrangle, including the construction of a library on the west side, but the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641 put paid to his plans. Welsh tenants who supported Charles I refused to pay rent to the college after Michael Roberts was installed as principal in 1648 by the puritan regime, leaving the college [...] "on the verge of financial collapse". Overall, the college was [...] "reduced... to administrative chaos" [...] and in 1660 it was said to be in a [...] "shatter'd condition", having suffered [...] "a decade of corruption and internal strife quite unique in Oxford during the revolutionary period". The college obtained further land on Market Street in 1675, and [...] building work began again in 1676. Sir Leoline Jenkins built the library on the west side, which was completed by 1679. After further land was obtained to link the Market Street and Ship Street sides of the college, further rooms, including what is now known as the Senior Common Room (SCR), were built at the instigation of Jonathan Edwards (principal from 1688 to 1712) to complete the inner quadrangle; the project was completed just after his death in 1712. Work to add a ceiling and <b>wainscotting</b> in the SCR took place in 1736, at a cost of £52 4s 5d, with the walls to the west of the college placed further back to enlarge the common room's garden and increase the light. Some minor work to repair and restore the walls has been carried out using Doulting stone.|$|E

2500|$|Charles Wexford opposed {{any major}} enhancements, but Lillian ignored his wishes {{and began a}} major {{restoration}} of the hotel in a Greco-Roman architectural style. Between 1917 and 1919, Italian artisans installed a mosaic terrazzo tile floor composed of two million one-inch squares of marble in the atrium. The atrium fireplace was refaced with glazed ceramic tiles from the Rookwood Pottery Company. Marble <b>wainscotting</b> {{was added to the}} atrium's ground level walls, while the brick support columns were wrapped with canvas and painted to resemble marble. Outside, an elaborate veranda was constructed. Wooden shelters at the springs were replaced with brick structures, and a sunken garden was created with a fountain featuring an angel.|$|E

[...] <b>Wainscott,</b> {{who had been in the}} soda business in Winchester, Kentucky since 1902, had developed Roxa-Kola, his previous flagship product, in 1906.

2500|$|A 1918 {{publication}} stated: [...] "New York {{is noted}} for its beautiful buildings, and the Martinique is no exception". The hotel is 19 stories high, and [...] "capitalized on the openness of Greeley Square" [...] (now Herald Square). It was built from glazed brick, [...] terracotta and limestone, and featured bespoke [...] "rusticated stonework balconies and prominent cartouches on all three of its facades". It is crowned by a large mansard roof and has decorated dormers. The south facade serves as the building's front. A 1910 brochure states, [...] "The Gentlemen’s Broadway Cafe is a veritable architectural gem. The walls and columns of Italian marble give to this room a richness which is completed by Pompeiian panels of unquestioned merit." [...] The Louis XVI dining room was described in the same brochure: “The <b>wainscotting</b> and pillars are of Circassian walnut, enclosing panels of gold silk tapestry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} combines Beaux Arts and Classical styles. [...] The {{structure was}} {{built around a}} central court [...] wide and [...] deep.

[...] All four sides of the building [...] "presented a finished appearance", each being [...] "handsomely ornamented with vari-colored tiles and concrete moulding." [...] The interior was finished with cut-glass chandeliers, Italian marble stairs and <b>wainscotting,</b> tile floors, and richly upholstered mahogany furniture. [...] The top floor was dedicated to common use, with a ballroom, library, billiard-room and three enclosed loggias.

6000|$|... "The Miss Penfolds," [...] he said, [...] "were so indignant {{that they}} left the house altogether, and you may believe that we ransacked it from top to bottom. I had four {{carpenters}} and two masons with me, and I think we tapped every square foot of wall in the house, took down the <b>wainscotting</b> wherever there was the slightest hollow sound, lifted lots of the flooring, and even wrenched up several of the hearthstones, but could find nothing whatever, except {{that there was a}} staircase leading from behind the <b>wainscotting</b> in Mr. Penfold's room to a door covered with ivy, and concealed from view by bushes {{to the left of the}} house; but the ivy had evidently been undisturbed for fifty years or so, this passage, even if known to Mr. Penfold, had certainly not been used in his time.|$|E

And, of course, {{if there was a}} secret hiding-place the Miss Penfolds would know of it as well as their brother. Martha used to think that the reason why the Miss Penfolds had the room shut up, and would never let her go into it without one of them being there to look after her, was that the hiding-place was somewhere in the library, and that they were afraid that when she was dusting and doing up she might come upon the will." ...|$|E

The door into his bedroom was open, and Griff, taking up one of the flat candlesticks, pursued his researches, holding the flame to all chinks or cracks in the <b>wainscotting</b> to detect {{draughts}} which might cause the dreary sounds, which were much more like suppressed weeping than any senseless gust of wind. Of draughts there were many, and he tried holding his hand against each crevice to endeavour to silence the wails; but these became more human and more distressful. Presently Clarence exclaimed, 'There!' and on his face there was a whiteness and an expression which always recurs to me on reading those words of Eliphaz the Temanite, 'Then a spirit passed before my face, and the hair of my flesh stood up.'

6000|$|... 'YOU!' {{said the}} old man contemptuously. 'What do YOU know of the time when young men shut {{themselves}} up in those lonely rooms, and read and read, hour after hour, and night after night, till their reason wandered beneath their midnight studies; till their mental powers were exhausted; till morning's light brought no freshness or health to them; and they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies to their dry old books? Coming down to a later time, and a very different day, what do YOU know of the gradual sinking beneath consumption, or the quick wasting of fever--the grand results of [...] "life" [...] and dissipation--which men have undergone in these same rooms? How many vain pleaders for mercy, do you think, have turned away heart-sick from the lawyer's office, to find a resting-place in the Thames, or a refuge in the jail? They are no ordinary houses, those. There is not a panel in the old <b>wainscotting,</b> but what, if it were endowed with the powers of speech and memory, could start from the wall, and tell its tale of horror--the romance of life, Sir, the romance of life!

60|$|The {{search was}} an {{exhaustive}} one. There was no appearance of an underground cellar, but {{on some of}} the boards of the shop being taken up, it was found that there was a large one extending over the whole house. This contained an immense variety of goods. In one corner was a pile of copper bolts that Captain Dave and John were able to claim at once, as they bore the brand of the maker from whom they obtained their stock. There were boxes of copper and brass ship and house fittings, and a very large quantity of rope, principally of the sizes in which the stock had been found deficient; but to these Captain Dave was unable to swear. In addition to these articles the cellar contained a number of chests, all of which were found to be filled with miscellaneous articles of wearing apparel--rolls of silk, velvet, cloth, and other materials--curtains, watches, clocks, ornaments of all kinds, and a considerable amount of plate. As among these were many articles which answered to the descriptions given of goods that had been stolen from country houses, the whole were impounded by the Chief Constable, and carried away in carts. The upper part of the house was carefully searched, the walls tapped, <b>wainscotting</b> pulled down, and the floors carefully examined. Several hiding-places were found, but nothing of any importance discovered in them.|$|E
