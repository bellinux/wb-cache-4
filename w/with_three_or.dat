5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{designed}} {{before a}} low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated {{that of all}} the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: only one or two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more on most other types.|$|E
5|$|For lines <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four tracks with express service, local stops {{will have}} side {{platforms}} {{and the middle}} one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

5|$|In {{his senior}} season, Hyman was named {{alternate}} captain. He was Michigan's leading scorer, and the Big Ten Scoring Champion, setting {{a new record}} with 54 points, scoring 22 goals and 32 assists in only 37 games. Hyman became the first Michigan player to record 20 goals in a season since Louie Caporusso, and {{the first player to}} record 50 points or more since Carl Hagelin during the 2009–10 season. Hyman led the team with 17 multiple-point games, including six games <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more points. On October 24, 2014, Hyman recorded a career-high five points, and his first career hat-trick against UMass Lowell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} form, pupils study five AS-level (the {{equivalent}} of half an A-level qualification) subjects for one year, which may include General Studies and usually continue <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four subjects to A-level. A wide choice of subjects is offered at A-level: English, French, German, Latin, Classical Civilisation, Art, Design and Technology, Music, Geography, History, Economics, Government and Politics, Business Studies, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Religious Studies and P.E. Most combinations of subjects can be accommodated. All students {{participate in a}} games activity on a Wednesday afternoon.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter {{tending to the}} specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

5|$|Words <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more syllables, if {{they are}} not compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E

5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped {{from one of the}} gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw was the Dodgers' Opening Day starter for {{the second}} year in a row, where he pitched three innings of shutout ball against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park before being removed from the game due to flu-like symptoms. On April 27, he was able to last through eight innings for his second win of the season against the Washington Nationals. The win was also his 12th {{straight}} home win, tying him with Ed Roebuck (June 1960 – August 1962) and Orel Hershiser (September 1984 – October 1985) for the longest home winning streak since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. Kershaw won the National League's Player of the Week Award for the week of May 14–20 after he made two starts during that week and pitched 16 scoreless innings, including his fourth career shutout. Kershaw was selected to appear in the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the second straight year he made the team. On August 11, he went over 200 innings on the season, becoming the 12th Los Angeles Dodger pitcher <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more seasons of 200 or more innings, and the first since Hershiser did it five times from 1985 to 1989. Kershaw also became just the fifth Dodger pitcher with three straight 200 strikeout seasons.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June, Iraqi {{government}} forces launched an airborne assault on Tikrit <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four commando helicopters flown into a stadium at the University of Tikrit. One of the helicopters {{was shot down}} and crash-landed at the stadium, while another had to conduct an emergency landing after suffering a mechanical failure. The crew of the second helicopter, which included a Lebanese pilot, was then captured by insurgents. Fierce fighting then ensued around the university compound, while army snipers positioned themselves on tall buildings in the university complex. In {{the early hours of}} the assault, a helicopter gunship struck the city's hospital compound. By the next day, sporadic clashes continued at the university as Iranian-trained Shiite militiamen were dispatched and managed to seize control of tall buildings in the university area.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was complex, often <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more usurpers in existence at once. Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger, both rebel generals declared to be emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed {{for the first}} time in 193 AD at the Battle of Cyzicus, in which Niger was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the Battle of Nicaea later that year and the Battle of Issus the following year, for Niger to be destroyed. Almost as soon as Niger's userpation had been ended, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of Clodius Albinus, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general Virius Lupus in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed in the Battle of Lugdunum by Severus himself.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E
5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish {{and those with}} only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
