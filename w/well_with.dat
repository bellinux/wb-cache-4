5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair <b>well</b> <b>with</b> bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair <b>well</b> <b>with</b> bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair <b>well</b> <b>with</b> sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair <b>well</b> <b>with</b> a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

Four quantum <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> different structures are examined, where each well has similar transition energy, yet a wide range of wave function overlaps are observed.

Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
