Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr {{as the father of}} two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{equipment}} losses {{during the}} German offensive came to 1,614tanks and self-propelled guns destroyed or damaged of the 3,925 vehicles {{committed to the}} battle. The Soviet losses were roughly three {{times larger than the}} German losses. During Operation Kutuzov, 2,349tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of an initial strength of 2,308; a loss of over 100percent. During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1,864tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of the 2,439 employed. The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5:1 in favour of the German military. However, large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength. The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks; many Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to keep them in the fight. Soviet tank strength <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to 2,750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers offense {{took over}} in game 3 as they {{took the lead in}} the series with a 13-6 win at Dodger Stadium. Ramírez had two more extra base hits (a double and triple) in the game to tie the NLDS record and {{franchise}} record (Steve Garvey, Duke Snider) for most extra-base hits in the postseason. The 13 runs tied a franchise record set in the 1956 World Series. The Dodgers brought Kershaw back on short rest in game 4 and he pitched six innings, while allowing only two unearned runs (thanks to two Adrian Gonzalez errors). Carl Crawford hit two solo homers in his first two at-bats, the first Dodger {{to do so in the}} playoffs since Shawn Green in the 2004 National League Division Series. An RBI double by José Constanza off Ronald Belisario in the 7th gave the Braves the lead, but the Dodgers <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> thanks to a two-run homer by Juan Uribe in the 8th off David Carpenter. Kenley Jansen closed it down in the ninth to preserve the 4-3 series clinching victory for the Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|Ross {{was known}} as a smart fighter with great stamina. He {{retained}} his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933 and against Peter Nebo to begin 1934. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus Jimmy McLarnin. Ross vacated the light welterweight title to go after McLarnin's welterweight title and won by a 15-round decision, his third world championship. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision and recovered the title. After that, Ross went back down to light welterweight and reclaimed his title with a 12-round decision over Bobby Pacho. After beating Klick and Henry Woods by decision to retain that title, he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> in weight for his third and last fight with McLarnin; he recovered the welterweight title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, over that stretch were against Garcia and against Izzy Jannazzo, on points in 15 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{commenced}} at Broken Hill, NSW in 1885, initially {{for lead}} {{in the form of}} galena and then the ore deposit was found to contain silver & zinc. As well as the mine at Broken Hill, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) had also established smelter operations at Port Pirie in South Australia. In 1892 there was a strike by miner's at Broken Hill that was precipitated by a decision to terminate the 1889 and 1890 agreements that prevented the introduction of a contract system for ore excavation and reduced the working week from 48 hours to 46. The strike was abandoned after 16 weeks when several strike leaders were imprisoned for 'unlawful conspiracy and inciting riots'. As a result of the defeat of the strike, there was a 10% reduction in wages, the working week <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to 48 hours and contract mining continued. The defeat of this and other strikes of the 1890s, the maritime dispute and the shearers' strike, have been seen as the cause of the creation and electoral support for the Australian Labor Party. Not all historians accept this thesis with some doubting the simple causal relationship between the strike and the formation of the Labor party.|$|E

In 2012, clicking on the image of a DVD next to the site logo led to a video about a purported option to order every YouTube video for home delivery on DVD. In 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company The Onion to claim that the video sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would announce a winner of the contest when the site <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> in 2023.

When the time came another exchange of artillery ensued but this time the rebels stayed a while to try to silence the Union gunners. Colonel Pierce expected the ironclads to return so while they were engaging at Trent's Reach, the garrison of Fort Brady and the surrounding batteries focused on improving the defenses of their positions. Pierce placed pickets down the river and at 3:00 am one of them returned and told the colonel that the rebels were coming back. When the fighting began again it was described as being very intense but at no time were the Confederates able to silence the Union guns and they eventually broke off the action.
