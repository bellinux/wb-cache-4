40|$|Pain {{sensitivity}} {{is typically}} reduced in individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> although {{the nature of}} this relationship is poorly understood. Relatedly, the ingestion of sweet tasting solutions has been shown to reduce pain, possibly by an opioid mediated mechanism. The objective of the present research was to investigate the effects of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and sweet taste on pain sensitivity in healthy adults. The first aim was to test whether <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> interacts with sweet taste to affect pain sensitivity. The second aim was to test whether endogenous opioids mediate the effects of sweet taste and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> on pain. In Study One, participants held sweet, bitter and plain water solutions in their mouths during exposure to a painful cold pressor test. Replicating previous research, individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> were found to have generally higher pain tolerance than those with lower <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Sweet taste was associated with an increase in pain tolerance but only in individuals with lower range <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> increasing their tolerance to the level of those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> In Study Two, participants held sweet solution, plain water or nothing in their mouths during cold pressors on two days. To test the involvement of endogenous opioids, participants were administered an opioid antagonist on one of the test days. Participants <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> resting <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> again showed increased tolerance and reduced unpleasantness ratings of the pain tasks, as well as dampened mood reactivity to the testing. In these individuals, the opioid antagonist reduced their pain tolerance and partially reversed their lower mood reactivity. As in Study One, sweet taste increased pain tolerance in participants with lower but not <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> but this was unaffected by opioid blockade. Taken together these results suggest some overlap between non-opioid mechanisms of sweet taste and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> related analgesia. These results are also consistent with work suggesting that endogenous opioid activity {{may play a role in}} the reduced pain sensitivity, and perhaps mood reactivity, of individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and that multiple processes are involved in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia...|$|R

25|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the causes of prostate cancer remains elusive. The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. Prostate cancer is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. However, many men never know they have prostate cancer. Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found prostate cancer in 30% of men in their fifties, and in 80% of men in their seventies. Men who have first-degree family members with prostate cancer appear to have double the risk of getting the disease compared to men without prostate cancer in the family. This risk appears to be greater for men with an affected brother than for men with an affected father. In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths due to prostate cancer. Men <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> are more likely to develop prostate cancer. There is a small increased risk of prostate cancer associated with lack of exercise.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A small placental {{surface at}} birth {{has been shown}} to be {{associated}} with the development of hypertension in later life. In this study we extend this observation by looking at the relationship between the number of placental cotyledons and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in childhood. Because the number of cotyledons is correlated with the surface area, we hypothesized that fewer cotyledons would be associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> METHODS: The Alspac study is a longitudinal study of 13, 971 children born in Bristol. Their placentas were stored in formalin. We photographed the placentas of a sample of the children and related the number of maternal cotyledons to their <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> levels at age 9 years. RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, a greater number of maternal cotyledons was associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Among boys, a greater number of cotyledons was associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> systolic and diastolic pressure but not <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> pulse pressure. Diastolic pressure rose by 2. 2  mmHg (95 % CI 0. 6 to 3. 7, p =  0. 007) for every 10 additional cotyledons. Among girls, a greater number of cotyledons was associated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> systolic pressure and pulse pressure but not <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> diastolic pressure. Pulse pressure rose by 2. 7  mmHg (1. 1 - 4. 3, p <  0. 001) for every 10 additional cotyledons. These associations were little changed by adjustment for placental surface area. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that a large number of maternal cotyledons is associated with raised <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in childhood. The associations differ in the two sexes...|$|R

She suffered <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> complained about bad eyesight and pain in her neck. Grégoire François Du Rietz, since 1642 the court physician, was called when she suddenly collapsed in 1651. In February 1652 the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths and healthy meals, as opposed to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five, and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and working so hard and to remove the books from her apartments. For years, Christina knew by heart all the sonnets from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. She now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 [...] "laden in riches and curses".|$|E

We therefore aimed to assess whether AC responses facilitate <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and early sub-clinical structural vascular disease via alterations in frequency- and time-domain heart rate variability (HRV) responses. Methods:We included 355 African and Caucasian men and women without pre-existing atrial fibrillation, aged 45 9 years. Significant interaction on main effects (coping ethnicity gender) for left carotid intima media thickness far wall (L-CIMTf) and cross sectional wall area values necessitated selection of AC responders above mean via the Coping Strategy Indicator. We collected B-mode ultrasound L-CIMTf, ambulatory BP andeHRV data. Overnight fasting blood was obtained. Results: Overall, Africans and AC Africans, mostly men, revealed a poorer lifestyle profile, higher prevalence of hypertensive status, disturbed sympathovagal balance and depressed HRV temporal and geometric patterns compared to the Caucasians (P 0. 05). Moderately depressed non-linear and timedomain HRV (SDNN < 100 ms) was prevalent in 28 % of Africans compared to 11 % of Caucasians. A similar trend was shown for the AC African participants (32 %) compared to Caucasians (16 %). Only depressed HRV time-domain (SDNN: adj.
