5|$|In 1832 the Gibraltar Public School, a free English-language {{establishment}} {{for poor}} children, {{was set up}} in a government-owned building on Flat Bastion Road.

5|$|The {{aristocracy}} shunned the City {{and lived}} {{either in the}} countryside beyond the slum suburbs, or in the exclusive Westminster district (the modern West End), the site of Charles II's court at Whitehall. <b>Wealthy</b> <b>people</b> preferred to live at a convenient distance from the traffic-clogged, polluted, unhealthy City, especially after it {{was hit by a}} devastating outbreak of bubonic plague in the Plague Year of 1665.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as <b>wealthy</b> <b>people</b> like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|The IIF {{was able}} to invest in {{development}} projects due to Disston's purchase, {{and an opportunity to}} improve transportation arose when oil tycoon Henry Flagler began purchasing land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida, as far south as Palm Beach in 1893. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations. The land bordering the rail lines was developed as citrus farms. By 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay. Three months after the first train had arrived, the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town. Miami became a prime destination for extremely <b>wealthy</b> <b>people</b> after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely <b>wealthy</b> <b>people.</b> Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E

5|$|Many craft guilds were {{established}} {{in the second half}} of the 13th century, and a patrician stratum based in commerce and craft production displaced the older landed elite in the town's leadership. Through the privilege granted by Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1405, the city opted out from the jurisdiction of voivodes, vice-voivodes and royal judges, and obtained the right to elect a twelve-member jury every year. In 1488, King Matthias Corvinus (born in Kolozsvár in 1440) ordered that the centumvirate—the city council, consisting of one hundred men—be half composed from the homines bone conditiones (the <b>wealthy</b> <b>people),</b> with craftsmen supplying the other half; together they would elect the chief judge and the jury. Meanwhile, an agreement was reached providing that half of the representatives on this city council were to be drawn from the Hungarian, half from the Saxon population, and that judicial offices were to be held on a rotating basis. In 1541, Kolozsvár became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom (that transformed to Principality of Transylvania in 1570) after the Ottoman Turks occupied the central part of the Kingdom of Hungary; a period of economic and cultural prosperity followed. Although Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) served as a political capital for the princes of Transylvania, Cluj (Kolozsvár) enjoyed the support of the princes to a greater extent, thus establishing connections with the most important centres of Eastern Europe at that time, along with Košice (Kassa), Kraków, Prague and Vienna.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuous compassion, the {{practice}} of publicly donating great sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor, is sometimes described {{as a type of}} conspicuous consumption.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this depopulation, the island was left {{under-developed}} and isolated until the mid-20th century. The isolation kept many of the pre-Civil War buildings intact and, by the 1950s, enterprising developers began buying up large sections of the island and restoring them to create an upmarket destination for <b>wealthy</b> <b>people</b> in the Northeastern United States. This highly controlled development can be compared to less-regulated development in neighboring Martha's Vineyard, the development of which served as a model for what the Nantucket developers wanted to avoid.|$|E
25|$|Citrus fruits — {{among them}} the bitter orange — were {{introduced}} to Sicily in the 9th century {{during the period of}} the Emirate of Sicily, but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area. Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It also was considered a luxury item and <b>wealthy</b> <b>people</b> grew oranges in private conservatories, called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe.|$|E
