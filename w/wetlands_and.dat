In New Mexico, riverine wetlands are generally associated with riparian areas found in the floodplains or once floodplains, of the Rio Grande and associated tributaries. Riverine wetlands are supported with water provided by over bank flow from the river, connection to the shallow groundwater, and/or acequia systems. <b>Wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian areas are impacted by land uses, hydromodification and other activities that occur within a watershed. <b>Wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian areas {{play an important role}} within a watershed by providing many beneficial environmental functions. This paper examines watershed issues affecting the quality of remaining <b>wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian resources in the valley and proposes a strategy for managing these resources within a watershed context for the Alcalde/Velarde valley located in the Upper Rio Grande Watershed in Northern New Mexico. The Alcalde/Velarde valley community may provide a unique opportunity to protect existing <b>wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian areas, and to restore degraded or former <b>wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian areas that have been lost to development and channelization, and to reinstate the functions that <b>wetland</b> <b>and</b> riparian areas once served in this river valley...|$|R

5|$|After delays due to {{concerns}} over nearby <b>wetlands</b> <b>and</b> {{the appearance of}} the ramps from street level, the Town of Winchester granted approval in March 2011. In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting bids for the primary construction work on the station, worth $1.525 million. The scope of work included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from street level, as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the State Planning Commission {{proposed}} {{defining a}} reservation for {{the extension of}} the Kwinana Freeway to the southern edge of Perth Metropolitan Region, north-east of Mandurah.

A number of routes were investigated for the central section, between Mortimer Road and Stakehill Road. The EPA found all proposed routes acceptable, and that the preferred route minimised environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely.

The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.

5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, <b>wetlands</b> <b>and</b> rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E

5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, <b>wetlands</b> <b>and</b> mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.|$|E

5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine <b>wetlands,</b> <b>and</b> coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|The coastal {{districts of}} Andhra Pradesh usually {{bear the brunt}} of heavy rains that occur during the {{northeast}} monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding.
