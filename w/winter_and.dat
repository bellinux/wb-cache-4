5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{two to three}} years of age and males at about two years. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year, but it peaks during <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> early spring.

5|$|Later on {{the morning}} of 13 September 1942 <b>Winter</b> <b>and</b> Desranges were ordered to collect the bodies of the men who had been killed on the beach.

5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E

5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, {{but the group}} {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to a cold <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> the failure of General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>winter</b> <b>and</b> spring, {{when the}} water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E

The remainder mostly found themselves stranded in isolated camps and settlements along the ice-covered river often in desperate circumstances.|$|E
