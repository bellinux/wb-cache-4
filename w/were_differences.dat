5|$|Although there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> {{in season}} one, the current rules have applied in all {{subsequent}} seasons. One feature continued from season {{one was the}} way the show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there <b>were</b> <b>differences.</b> Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|While Roman and Celtic Christianity {{were very}} similar in {{doctrine}} and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> in practice. The most contentious were the method of calculating Easter, and the form of head shaving for priests known as tonsure. Other differences were in the rites of ordination and baptism, and {{in the form of}} service of the liturgy. In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of clerical celibacy, intense secularisation of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a diocesan structure. This made abbots (or coarbs), rather than bishops, the most important element the church hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ {{was believed to be}} present in the Eucharist, but there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament.|$|E

25|$|There <b>were</b> <b>differences,</b> {{though these}} were not evident to Darwin on reading the paper.

Formulation of the problem is first presented to analyze whether there <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> in stock returns before and after religious holiday; secondly, to analyze whether there <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> in stock returns before and after the national holiday;third, to analyze whether there <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> in stock returns before religious holidays and before a national holiday; fourth, to analyze whether there <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> in stock returns after the religious holiday and after a national holiday. This research uses the Composite Stock Price Index in the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2007 to 2011 as a sample. The variables used are the stock returns with stock returns one day before the religious holiday, stock returns one day after the religious holiday, stock returns one day before national holidays, and stock returns one day after a national holiday. The method of analysis used in this reserch were sample t-test. These results prove that there <b>is</b> no <b>difference</b> in stock returns before and after the religious holiday, there <b>is</b> no <b>difference</b> in stock returns before and after the national holiday, there <b>is</b> no <b>differences</b> in stock returns before religious holidays and before national holiday, and there <b>is</b> no <b>difference</b> in stock returns after religious holidays and after a national holiday...|$|R

25|$|The {{two other}} {{stabilization}} plans amounted to renewed attempts at bringing inflation down from very high levels. It was soon clear {{that without a}} thorough reform of the public sector, controlling inflation would be impossible. Both plans introduced a price freeze and eliminated indexation, but there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> between them, and with the Cruzado Plan. Neither was able to address the public-sector disequilibrium effectively. The objective of the Summer Plan, for instance, was mainly to avoid hyperinflation in an election year.|$|E
25|$|In {{artificial}} selection studies, specific strains of rats were bred to prefer alcohol.

Rats that were not bred for this preference did not have these traits. Upon analyzing the brains of these two strains of rats, {{it was discovered that}} there <b>were</b> <b>differences</b> in chemical composition of certain areas of the brain. This study suggests that certain brain mechanisms are more genetically prone to alcoholism.|$|E
