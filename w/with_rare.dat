40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{patients}} with cancer experience multiple pre-diagnostic consultations in primary care, leading to longer time intervals to specialist investigations and diagnosis. Patients <b>with</b> <b>rarer</b> cancers {{are thought to}} be at higher risk of such events, but concrete evidence of this is lacking. AIM: To examine the frequency and predictors of repeat consultations with GPs in patients <b>with</b> <b>rarer</b> cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING: Patient-reported data on pre-referral consultations from three English national surveys of {{patients with}} cancer (2010, 2013, and 2014), pooled to maximise the sample size of rarer cancers. METHOD: The authors examined the frequency and crude and adjusted odds ratios for ≥ 3 (versus 1 - 2) pre-referral consultations by age, sex, ethnicity, level of deprivation, and cancer diagnosis (38 diagnosis groups, including 12 rarer cancers without prior relevant evidence). RESULTS: Among 7838 patients <b>with</b> 12 <b>rarer</b> cancers, crude proportions of patients with ≥ 3 pre-referral consultations ranged from > 30. 0...|$|R
5|$|After {{the release}} of Live & Reloaded, Rare began work on another game in the Conker {{universe}} titled Conker: Gettin' Medieval. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, <b>with</b> <b>Rare</b> instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled. Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the sandbox game Project Spark. The campaign, titled Conker's Big Reunion, is set {{ten years after the}} events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. Conker's Bad Fur Day is also included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Before Donkey Kong Countrys production, Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper {{invested}} and programmed {{experiments with}} a Silicon Graphics Challenge workstation, with their initial focus centred on a boxing game. Although never reaching beyond {{the stages of}} initial development, senior Nintendo staff who visited their Twycross studio were impressed with their progress after being shown a working demo. Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal <b>with</b> <b>Rare.</b> Following talks between Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology and the addition of Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E

5|$|Othnielosaurus {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} members of the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna, {{diminutive}} in comparison to the giant sauropods. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining gallery forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas <b>with</b> <b>rare</b> trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Othnielosaurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2-5.|$|E

Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Dürer to the wider world.

It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles such as Uluops, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like Fruitachampsa, several species of pterosaur like Kepodactylus, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Hesperosaurus, Drinker, Fruitadens, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Coelurus {{is regarded as a}} small terrestrial carnivore, feeding on small prey items like insects, mammals, and lizards. It is thought to have been a fast animal, certainly faster than the similar but shorter-footed Ornitholestes. Coelurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2 and 5 of the Morrison Formation.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and <b>with</b> <b>rare</b> candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle <b>with</b> <b>rare</b> and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
