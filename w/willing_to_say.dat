25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

2500|$|The {{location}} of Hehil is not known, but many scholars {{have tried to}} identify it. In 1916, Celtic scholar Donald MacKinnon was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more than that it was on [...] "the Devonian peninsula", and Christopher Snyder simply stated in 2003: [...] "722 The Annales Cambriae record a British victory at Hehil in Cornwall".|$|E

2500|$|Grover Krantz {{writes that}} [...] "Patterson had the film {{developed}} {{as soon as}} possible. At first {{he thought he had}} brought in proof of Bigfoot's existence and really expected the scientists to accept it. But only a few scientists were willing to even look at the film," [...] usually at showings at scientific organizations. These were usually arranged at the behest of zoologist, author, and media figure Ivan Sanderson, a supporter of Patterson's film. Seven showings occurred, in Vancouver, Manhattan, The Bronx, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. [...] again (all by the end of 1968); then, later, in Beaverton, Oregon. Of those who were quoted, most expressed various reservations, although some were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they were intrigued by it.|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 GM Electrovan is {{credited}} with being the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced. Though fuel cells have {{been around since the}} early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of [...] "millions of dollars". In 2002, it was reported that GM spent about $100 million a year in research and development of fuel cell vehicle. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> exactly when hydrogen vehicles would be mass-produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted. He said [...] "I sure would be disappointed if we weren't there" [...] before 2020.|$|E
2500|$|Stein was beatified as {{a martyr}} on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Vatican City. The miracle {{that was the}} basis for her canonization was the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had {{swallowed}} a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl's father, Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for St. Teresa's intercession. Shortly thereafter the nurses {{in the intensive care unit}} saw her sit up completely healthy. Dr. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: [...] "I was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it was miraculous." [...] McCarthy would later attend St. Teresa's canonization.|$|E

2500|$|According to Swift, {{she wrote}} the song [...] "about an awkward {{situation}} where, well... Let me just preface by saying that I have happened to run into exes in strange places lately. This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!" [...] And my Mom is used to that at this point so, that's what this song is about." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moore's work in {{the comic}} book medium has been widely {{recognised}} by his peers and by critics. Comics historian George Khoury asserted that [...] "to call this free spirit the best writer {{in the history of}} comic books is an understatement" [...] whilst interviewer Steve Rose referred to him as [...] "the Orson Welles of comics" [...] who is [...] "the undisputed high priest of the medium, whose every word is seized upon like a message from the ether" [...] by comic book fans. Douglas Wolk observed: [...] "Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame: he's one of the pillars of English language comics, alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others. He's also the grand exception in that hall, since the other pillars are artists – and more often than not, writer/artists. Moore is a writer almost exclusively, though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with. That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory. The main reason that almost nobody's <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a single cartoonist is categorically superior to a writer/artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore's bibliography. In fact, a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore – Jaime Hernandez, Mark Beyer and most memorably Eddie Campbell." ...|$|E
