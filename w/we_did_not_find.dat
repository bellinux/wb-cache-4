The story, moreover, has no lack of movement, and the several characters are well drawn." ...|$|E

First, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any statistically significant three-year post takeover abnormal return. Second, we find evidence that overlapping stock return inflates the conventional t-test statistic. Third, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any direct evidence that long-run post takeover underperformance is due to overpriced takeovers. Finally, we examine four common financing methods of takeovers, and find stock offer underperforms the other three methods of payment...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{cross-country}} sample of mergers and acquisitions, {{we examine the}} role of cultural, institutional, geographic and managerial factors on post-merger default risk. We find that cultural factors, especially the relative difference in uncertainty avoidance between the acquiring and target country, {{play a significant role}} in affecting post-merger default risk. Furthermore, we find that institutional quality affects the post-merger default risk of acquiring firms. In contrast to the prior research <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any evidence indicating that managerial incentives drive post-merger default risk changes. Also, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any evidence indicating the relevance of geographic distance on default risk...|$|R

60|$|I {{found them}} so plentiful, and {{so easy to}} come at, that in short I sent fifty of them alive, tied neck and heels, {{in one of the}} shallops back to our ships, and ordered them to send their long-boats over for more; for though it was so little a way over, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> they had any of them on that side the river.|$|E

But <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> the ducks, although we made a diligent search for half-an-hour.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} precautionary {{behavior by}} relating job-loss risk to household net worth. We use existing best practice {{and some new}} strategies {{to deal with some}} problematic issues inherent in this literature regarding proxying uncertainty, instrumentation, and incorporating theoretical restrictions. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> precautionary variation in the wealth holdings of households with low permanent income, but do find precautionary effects for moderate and higher-income households. When the dependent variable is total net worth, these findings are robust to several alternative specifications. But <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> precautionary responses in subaggregates of wealth that exclude home equity. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of a change from a pre-trade {{transparent}} limit order book to an anonymous electronic limit order book. We use the Probability of Informed Trading (PIN) as a proxy for the participation rate of informed traders to test a theoretical prediction of Foucault, Moinas, and Theissen (2007). However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> significant explanatory power for the PIN measure in explaining bid-ask spreads after a change to anonymous trading. More generally, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> unambiguous evidence of an improvement in market quality, measured by bid-ask spreads, intraday volatility, and trading volume. We also find that there is no substantial change in upstairs trading...|$|R
60|$|And sure enough, {{not only}} she {{but her father}} and sister spoke English. So after that {{we had all the}} talk we wanted; and we wanted a good deal, for they were {{agreeable}} people. They were greatly interested in our customs; especially the alpenstocks, for they had not seen any before. They said that the Neckar road was perfectly level, so we must be going to Switzerland or some other rugged country; and asked us if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather.

60|$|Now {{there is}} this {{difference}} between the positions held in creation by animals and plants, and thence in the dispositions with which we regard them; that the animals, being {{for the most part}} locomotive, are capable both of living where they choose, and of obtaining what food they want, and of fulfilling all the conditions necessary to their health and perfection. For which reason they are answerable for such health and perfection, and we should be displeased and hurt if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> it in one individual as well as another.|$|E
