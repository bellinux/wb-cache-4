5|$|Food waste remains {{primarily}} {{disposed to}} landfill (54 per cent of total municipal <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> disposed of {{in this way}} in 2007/8), although year-on-year the amount being sent to landfill is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy efficient than comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{developments}} of 2007-8, food waste {{has continued to}} be a subject of attention, discussed in almost every major UK newspaper, often with issues such as climate change and famine in African nations. To reduce the impact of the aforementioned, food waste has been among the topics of discussion at recent International Summits; food <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> debated during the 34th G8 summit in Hokkaidō, Japan, as part of the discussion on the 2007–2008 world food price crisis.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> <b>waste</b> that {{contains}} radioactive material. Radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> usually {{a by-product of}} nuclear power generation and other applications of nuclear fission or nuclear technology, such as research and medicine. Radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> hazardous to all forms {{of life and the}} environment, and is regulated by government agencies in order to protect human health and the environment.|$|R

5|$|The nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} be shipped to the site by rail and/or truck in robust {{containers}} known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Among the 115 species {{recorded}} in 2004 on the site, 15 {{are included in}} the red list of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. In the shrubs near the path where green <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus (Clavulinopsis helvola), gray shag (Coprinopsis cinerea), black earth tongues (Trichoglossum hirsutum), Arrhenia spathulata and Marasmius limosus. Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, lilac leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) and burnt knight (Tricholoma ustale). Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles (Clavulinopsis fusiformis), Hebeloma clavulipes, Hebeloma fusipes, Hebeloma pusillum, and also lilac leg fibrecap and burnt knight. Dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus) and Scytinostroma hemidichophyticum for their part, were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood.|$|E
5|$|Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, {{after which}} a {{succession}} of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including strontium-90 and cobalt-60. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and toxic <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> buried, {{some of which have}} been cleaned up while others were dug up by black bears and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5000|$|Hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> <b>waste</b> {{that poses}} {{substantial}} or potential threats {{to public health}} or the environment. [...] In the United States, the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>are</b> regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> defined under RCRA in 40 CFR 261 where they are divided into two major categories: characteristic wastes and listed wastes.|$|R
50|$|<b>WASTE</b> <b>is</b> a {{peer-to-peer}} and friend-to-friend {{protocol and}} software application developed by Justin Frankel at Nullsoft in 2003 that features instant messaging, chat rooms, and file browsing/sharing capabilities. The name <b>WASTE</b> <b>is</b> {{a reference to}} Thomas Pynchon's novel The Crying of Lot 49. In the novel, <b>W.A.S.T.E.</b> <b>is</b> (among other things) an underground postal service.|$|R
50|$|Biomedical <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from normal trash or general waste, and differs from {{other types of}} hazardous waste, such as chemical, radioactive, universal or industrial waste. Medical facilities generate waste hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. While such <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> considered multihazardous, such as tissue samples preserved in formalin.|$|R
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, police {{wielding}} batons {{clashed with}} protesters who disrupted {{the passage of}} a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste from France to Germany. The train carrying the nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> heading for Dannenberg where the 123 tonnes of <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> loaded onto trucks and taken to the nearby storage facility of Gorleben, in central Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Organisers said 50,000 people had turned out but police said the figure was closer to 20,000. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.|$|E

25|$|On 19 April 2005 83,000 litres of {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> discovered to have leaked in the Thorp reprocessing plant from a cracked pipe {{into a huge}} stainless steel-lined concrete sump chamber built to contain leaks.|$|E
25|$|Although {{billions of}} yen were spent {{in an effort}} to decontaminate some areas around the troubled nuclear plant, the effort was {{described}} as futile, and radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> not collected properly and disposed of, and sometimes dumped into rivers.|$|E
25|$|Hicks Creek {{experiences}} {{low flow}} in dry weather. However, {{it also is}} prone to flash flooding. The creek also experiences nonpoint source pollution, as well as siltation, sedimentation, and streambank erosion. In the 1980s, hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> observed in the creek.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waste</b> sorting <b>is</b> {{still at}} a low level: only 33.4percent of <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> separated.|$|R
40|$|Low level {{radioactive}} <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> {{produced during}} {{the operation of}} the radioactive and nuclear installations of the Nuclear Engineering Institute (Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear, IEN) situated in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. These <b>wastes</b> can <b>be</b> generated during the operation and maintenance of the CV- 28 Cyclotron, the radioisotopes production, the research activities using natural thorium and uranium in chemical laboratories and, eventually, during the operation Argonauta Reactor. In accordance to the methodology of the radwastes management adopted in the IEN, the <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> segregated and treated depending on theirs physical, chemical, biological and radiological properties. The wastes with important levels of activity are separate and collected in special containers. Wastes containing short-lived radionuclides are also separated and left away for decaying. Solid <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> constituted of materials used in laboratories, such as papers, rubber gloves, plastics, over shoes, broken glassware, metal pieces, etc. These <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> classified as compressible, combustible, non-compressible and non-combustible. The solid <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> collected in suitable containers placed throughout the working area. Basically, the treatment methods used for these <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> activity decay, decontamination and compaction...|$|R
50|$|Post-consumer <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished}} from pre-consumer <b>waste,</b> which <b>is</b> the reintroduction of manufacturing scrap (such as trimmings from paper production, defective aluminum cans, etc.) {{back into the}} manufacturing process. Pre-consumer <b>waste</b> <b>is</b> commonly used in manufacturing industries, and is often not considered recycling in the traditional sense.|$|R
25|$|On 19 April 2005, leaked {{radioactive}} <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> discovered from ThORP (Thermal Oxide reprocessing plant) {{through a}} crack into a sump chamber which may have started as early as August 2004, and was categorised as a level 3 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale, resulting in fines.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, activist Sébastien Briat, who {{had tied}} himself to train tracks {{in front of}} a {{shipment}} of reprocessed nuclear <b>waste,</b> <b>was</b> run over by the wheels of the train.

50|$|Hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> <b>wastes</b> with {{properties}} {{that make them}} dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous <b>wastes</b> can <b>be</b> liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA hazardous <b>wastes</b> <b>are</b> <b>wastes</b> that appear {{on one of the}} four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of four characteristics-ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity.

25|$|In 2000, the {{remaining}} radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to go}} the mining unit of Caldas (MG), where the residues of Usan and Usin were usually disposed. However, popular pressure against it led then-MG Governor Itamar Franco to issue a decree prohibiting radioactive waste from coming into the state. Faced with this restriction, the residues remained in São Paulo.|$|E
25|$|Large {{amounts of}} saline water are {{injected}} into the sub-surface around the oil reservoirs to maintain oil pressure, and this can cause health problems if people drink the water. Witnesses also said that toxic <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> being dumped into pits in the dried swamp, which would flood into the marshes in the rainy season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, public {{officials}} and public hygiene experts studied and debated sanitation for several decades. The {{construction of an}} underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid <b>waste</b> <b>was</b> only begun in the mid 19th-century, gradually replacing the cesspool system, although cesspools were still in use {{in some parts of}} Paris into the 20th century.|$|E
