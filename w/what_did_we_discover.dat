40|$|Disability Studies in Education (DSE) {{offers a}} {{framework}} that (a) grounds policy / practice in the experiences ‘ perspectives of people with disabilities, (c) challenges practices/ policy that isolate, de-humanize individuals, and (c) leads to new questions to pose. In this session, pedagogy for critical book reviews from a DSE perspective is described. In writing a critical book review, we posed the following questions to guide the process. What is a DSE perspective? Why is this theoretical lens important for 21 st century teacher educators? What is a critical book review from a DSE perspective? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>discover?</b> Nevin, et al. theCritical Book Review...|$|E

Moreover, it was quite half a mile in width.|$|R

Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said, [...] "'Airbag' {{is a classic example of}} Colin and Phil saying, 'Let's make it sound like DJ Shadow.' But unfortunately - or fortunately - it <b>does</b> not, because <b>we</b> missed again. It's that thing of lumbering around in the dark, but still being excited by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> We're <b>discovering</b> these things for the first time rather than getting the pros in to show us how to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Let me {{apply this}} {{question}} to one matter upon which England {{has certainly been}} profoundly in earnest during the last decade. We have been almost frantically resolved to keep the empire of the sea. But have <b>we</b> really <b>done</b> all {{that could have been}} done? I ask it with all diffidence, but has our naval preparation been free from a sort of noisy violence, a certain massive dullness of conception? Have we really made anything like a sane use of our resources? I do not mean of our resources in money or stuff. It is manifest that the next naval war will be beyond all precedent a war of mechanisms, giving such scope for invention and scientifically equipped wit and courage as the world has never had before. Now, have we really developed any considerable proportion of the potential human quality available to meet the demand for wits? <b>What</b> are <b>we</b> <b>doing</b> to <b>discover,</b> encourage and develop those supreme qualities of personal genius that become more and more decisive with every new weapon and every new complication and unsuspected possibility it introduces? Suppose, for example, there was among us to-day a one-eyed, one-armed adulterer, rather fragile, prone to sea-sickness, and with just that one supreme quality of imaginative courage which made Nelson our starry admiral. Would he be given the ghost of a chance now of putting that gift at his country's disposal? I do not think he would, and I do not think he would because we underrate gifts and exceptional qualities, because there is no quickening appreciation for the exceptional best in a man, and because we overvalue the good behaviour, the sound physique, the commonplace virtues of mediocrity.|$|R
