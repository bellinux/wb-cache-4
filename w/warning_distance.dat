40|$|Most of the {{existing}} algorithms of vehicle rear-end collision have poor adaptive, high false alarm and missed alarm rates. A two-level early warning model based on logic algorithm of safe distance is discussed. The influence of road conditions, driver status and vehicle performance on the <b>warning</b> <b>distance</b> of rear-end collision in the driving process is analyzed. And for different driving conditions, a warning algorithm of vehicle rear-end collision based on neural network with adaptive threshold which can adapt to different status of the three main elements, human-vehicle-road is proposed. Also the comparison of the <b>warning</b> <b>distance</b> whether using adaptive strategies for the rear-end collision algorithm through changing the real-time status of human-vehicle-road is presented. The result of the simulation shows that the algorithm proposed is self-adaptive to the <b>warning</b> <b>distance</b> and region, and the feasibility of the algorithm is verified. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In order to improve the limitation of traditional PMP, this paper presents a novel effective way to plan motion with cooperation of roadside fixed sensors (RFSs). With their cooperation, the vehicles can get the surrounding information quickly and effectively, and give highly accurate projections about the near future conditions on road. After proposing our algorithm, the worst case is analyzed and methods are found to solve the problem. Finally we conduct one elemental contrast experiment, driver situation awareness, {{with or without the}} “cooperation” of RFSs in highway scenarios.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the three time <b>warning</b> <b>distances</b> for solving the large scale system of multiple groups of vehicles safety driving characteristics towards highway tunnel environment based on distributed model prediction control approach. Generally speaking, the system includes two parts. First, multiple vehicles {{are divided into}} multiple groups.

Each group of optimization performance considers the local optimization and the neighboring subgroup of optimization characteristics, which could ensure the global optimization performance. Second, the three time <b>warning</b> <b>distances</b> are studied based on the basic principles used for highway intelligent space (HIS) and the information framework concept is proposed according to the multiple groups of vehicles. The math model is built to avoid the chain avoidance of vehicles.

40|$|A new {{navigation}} method, {{called a}} Line of Sight Counteraction Navigation (LOSCAN) algorithm {{has been introduced}} to aid manoeuvre decision making for collision avoidance based on a two-ship encounter. The LOSCAN algorithm is derived from {{an extension of the}} basic principle of traditional missile proportional navigation, recognising that the objective of the latter is target capture rather than target avoidance. The basic concept is to derive an acceleration command so as to increase the misalignment between the ships' relative velocity and the line-of-sight. The algorithm includes a risk assessment and the generation of appropriate navigation commands to manoeuvre own ship free of collision if a risk of collision exists. Numerical examples have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The relationship between the distance at the closest point of approach with respect to early <b>warning</b> <b>distance,</b> and with the norm of the acceleration, has also been analysed. In operation, the collision avoidance decision making process is a complicated problem, with its solution subject to ship states, practical dynamic constraints, Collision Avoidance Regulations (COLREGS), encountering ship manoeuvre coordination and human decision making factors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine effects of driver, vehicle, and {{environment}} characteristics on Collision Warning System (CWS) design. One hypothesis was made that the capability of collision avoidance would not be same among a driver, vehicle, and environment group with different characteristics. Accident analysis and quantitative analysis was used to examine this hypothesis in terms of ‘risk’ and ‘safety margin’ respectively. Rear-end collision had a stronger focus in the present study. As a result of accident analysis, heavy truck showed a higher susceptibility of the fatal rear-end accidents than car and light truck. Also, dry road surface compared to wet or snow, dark condition compared to daylight condition, straight road compared to curved road, level road compared to grade, crest or sag, roadway having more than 5 travel lanes compared to roadway having 2, 3 or 4 travel lanes showed a higher susceptibility of the fatal rear-end accidents. Relative rear-end accidents involvement proportion compared to the other types of collision was used as a measure of susceptibility. As a result of quantitative analysis, a significant difference in terms of Required Minimum <b>Warning</b> <b>Distance</b> (RMWD) was made among a different vehicle type and braking system group. However, relatively small difference was made among a different age, gender group in terms of RMWD.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a simulation model of fighter operations, {{and sets it}} in the context of a hierarchy of defence models. The fighter model is then applied to two problems which developed from an assessment of the contribution of sensors to the air defence of the UK. These concern the influence of raid indirect routing and sensor information accuracy on the intercept capability of fighters scrambled from ground alert. Mathematical models of these two aspects of fighter operations are also developed; this dual approach ensures that the studies are both analytically understandable and operationally acceptable. Examples are given of the number of fighters from a single base which could intercept a concentrated (point) raid against a single offset target. In the case of raid indirect routing the main variables are the angle of the incoming feint track and the <b>warning</b> <b>distance.</b> In the analysis of the effect of sensor information errors the main variables are the actual position of the raid when warning is given and the errors in raid coordinates, heading and speed due to degradation of the warning system. In both cases of indirect routing and information errors alternative scramble and control procedures are considered. The work described in this thesis is a step towards an attempt to determine the more favourable procedures which a fighter force might adopt in the face of subtle raid tactics and degraded sensor performance. It also provides an illustration of the interplay between mathematical methods and computer models in the analysis of fighter operations. <p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} workers' responses to proximity warnings of static safety hazards on construction sites using a location-based proximity warning system named the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). A method of evaluating workers' responses to proximity warnings is proposed. The method consists of six variables: warning time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to a hazard when a worker receives a warning), dangerous time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to the hazard when the worker comes close to the hazard), and response time and distance (the difference between dangerous time and warning time, {{and the difference between}} dangerous distance and <b>warning</b> <b>distance).</b> Finally, whether a worker responds to a warning is evaluated against a two-second threshold and a two-meter threshold in terms of response time and distance respectively. The experiment was conducted over 17 workdays with the participation of 72 workers and resulted in 5391 warnings on a real-life construction project in Shanghai, China. The workers' responses were analyzed with respect to two factors: building trades and a-priori risk levels. The research found that workers responded to proximity warnings actively, but slightly differently across the selected building trades; carpenters had longer response latency in hazardous areas than ironworkers did, and response percentages were high for hazardous areas with high risks. The results also show evidence that PCMS has the potential to improve workers' safety performance. The limitations of the present study and future research directions are also addressed.

30|$|Experiment 2 complemented these {{findings}} by demonstrating that movement behaviors suggest a dynamic decision-making process {{in advance of}} entering an intersection. Practically speaking, pedestrian wayfinders moved themselves {{to the side of}} the road (and onto the sidewalk) toward their ultimate turn direction, likely to maximize the efficiency of in-intersection maneuvers. This pattern is analogous to the way that robots can evolve to use cognitive strategies and efficiently move toward the side of a hallway corresponding to a subsequent turn direction (Carvalho & Nolfi, 2016). It is also related to the timing of GPS prompts, wherein users find utility in planning a behavior long before its execution is required. GPS devices use navigation prompts (e.g. In 500  ft, turn right onto Main St.) that are intentionally delivered before entering an intersection, typically using an algorithm that provides a maneuver instruction at a variable <b>warning</b> <b>distance</b> from a junction (Tamai & Pai, 1999). In other words, the systems intentionally provide information to enable planning and decision-making regarding an upcoming maneuver (Brown & Laurier, 2012; Rehrl, Häusler, Leitinger, & Bell, 2014). When these devices fail to provide information in a timely manner, the planning and decision-making process is interrupted, possibly resulting in a failed maneuver. Advanced planning, whether relying upon emergent environmental memory or a GPS device, provides the wayfinder with the opportunity to maneuver themselves to be in an optimal position for an approaching turn. The notion that wayfinders make decisions in advance of an intersection approach also supports some research from driving, demonstrating that drivers often decide whether to continue or stop far in advance of arrival at a signalized intersection (Gates, Noyce, Laracuente, & Nordheim, 2007; Yang, Tian, Wang, Zhou, & Liang, 2014).|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} effects of weather related factors {{on the performance}} of pilots under free flight. A weather scenario was defined by a combination of precipitation factors (light rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain or snow), visibility (1, 4, 8 miles), wind conditions (light, medium, or heavy), cloud ceiling (800 ft. below, 1800 ft above, and 4000 ft horizontal). The performance of the aircraft self-separation was evaluated in terms of detection accuracy and detection times for student- and commercial (expert) pilots. Overall, the results obtained from a behavioral analysis showed that in general, the ability to recognize intruder aircraft conflict incidents, followed by the ability to acquire the spatial location of the intruder aircraft relative to ownership aircraft were judged to be the major cognitive tasks as perceived by the participants during self-separation. Further, the participants rarely used cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) during conflict management related to aircraft separation, but used CDTI highly during decision-making tasks. In all weather scenarios, there were remarkable differences between expert and student pilots in detection times. In summary, weather scenarios were observed to affect intruder aircraft detection performance accuracies. There was interaction effects between weather Scenario- 1 and Scenario- 2 for climbing task data generated by both expert- and student- pilots at high traffic density. Scenario- 3 weather condition provided an opportunity for poor detection accuracy as well as detection time increase. This may be attributed to low visibility. The intruder aircraft detection times were not affected by the weather conditions during climbing and descending tasks.

25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance <b>warning</b> some <b>distance</b> before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} Multi-Camera Lane Departure Warning (MCLDW) system and a framework to evaluate it. A Lane Departure Warning (LDW) system is a safety feature that is included in a few luxury automobiles. Using a single camera, it performs the task of informing the driver if a lane change is imminent. The core component of an LDW system is a lane detector, whose objective is to find lane markers on the road. Therefore, we start this dissertation by explaining the requirements of an ideal lane detector, and then present several algorithmic implementations that meet these requirements. After selecting the best implementation, we present the MCLDW methodology. Using a multi-camera setup, MCLDW system combines the detected lane marker information from each camera's view to estimate the immediate distance between the vehicle and the lane marker, and signals a <b>warning</b> if this <b>distance</b> is under a certain threshold. Next, we introduce a procedure to create ground truth and a database of videos which serve as the framework for evaluation. Ground truth is created using an efficient procedure called Time-Slicing that allows the user to quickly annotate the true locations of the lane markers in each frame of the videos. Subsequently, we describe the details of a database of driving videos that has been put together to help establish a benchmark for evaluating existing lane detectors and LDW systems. Finally, we conclude the dissertation by citing the contributions of the research and discussing the avenues for future work.

40|$|This thesis {{studied the}} drivers’ {{communicative}} interactions, which constitute a necessary {{component of the}} driving task. These interactions are based on successive elementary communicative acts. It is a common observation that when drivers predict that their vehicle {{may be found in}} the future in dangerous proximity to another vehicle, they tend to intentionally communicate in advance their motion intent to the other involved drivers, so that they may jointly plan and execute a safe future motion plan. At a theoretical level, the objective of this thesis was to study the interactive part of the driving task, shedding light on the phenomenon of communication of drivers’ intent and their agreement on a future common motion plan. At a practical level, the aim of the thesis was to develop a model of drivers’ communicative interactions, for integration, as a manoeuvring negotiations level, in Driving Support and Automation Systems (DSAS), so that their functionality is more in accordance to human expectations. Chapter 2 studies the importance of the studied phenomenon of communicative drivers’ interactions, and how such interactions can be decomposed into elementary phases {{in the form of a}} flowchart and described in the form of a discussion between the involved drivers. Video recordings of natural overtakings on a highway, with two directions without central barrier, were used for a first empirical confirmation of the frequency and significance of such interactions. The analysis of 82 overtakings showed that the intent to overtake could be anticipated before the start of the manoeuvre in 45, 12 % of cases, through formal and informal cues. In 6 of the 22 cases when the intent could be anticipated and there was an oncoming vehicle, its driver modified the trajectory of the vehicle so as to facilitate the overtaking. Chapter 3 includes a literature review of cognitive drive models, such as the hierarchical model of Michon, the model of Wilde, the COCOM model, the situation awareness levels of Endsley, the ECOM model and the Joint Action Control model. All but one of these models are personal models, that focus on a single driver, and analyse how he/she performs the various activities necessary for the driving task. There is no clear reference or modelling of deliberate drivers’ communicative interactions before a manoeuvre, which aim to ensure their common understanding for the safer and more convenient manoeuvre conduct. Chapter 4 presents the evolution of attempts to design and develop DSAS and systems to recognise driver’s intent. The initial design attempts were based on parameters such as time to collision with the involved vehicle. Still, experience showed that warnings by such DSAS were not in agreement with drivers’ expectations. Thus, the recent design guidelines by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggest that the timing of the warnings by DSAS should be based on the expected driver’s response time and on the deceleration level selected by the driver. So, several DSAS estimate risk of collision based on the forecasted future vehicles trajectory according to motion models. But, the <b>warning</b> <b>distances</b> calculated by such DSAS are large and not consistent with the risk assessment by an average driver. Indeed, several studies report that the acceptance of warning systems by drivers is rather limited. One possible reason is that the warnings of DSAS are not consistent with the drivers’ estimations and expectations. In this thesis it is argued that this occurs because DSAS do not consider in their design the drivers’ communicative interactions. Chapter 5 attempts to clarify some terms used when describing the phenomenon. Coordination can be regarded as the orchestration of behaviours so as to achieve a common aim and is considered to occur at a pre-conscious level. Cooperation can be regarded as an observed social interaction with a positive outcome for each of the involved players. Social behaviour is the behaviour which is oriented towards other people and social interactions are the acts, actions or practices of two or more “selves”, each oriented towards one another, i. e. any behaviour which seeks to influence or take into account the subjective experiences or intent of another self. In this thesis it is argued that driving is often a social activity, that drivers consider other vehicles as social units, as "animate human-vehicles", and largely base their expectations for the evolution of the traffic scene by observing and interpreting the behaviour of these social units. Then, it is analysed how driving can be considered as a joint activity, based on a Basic Agreement, which for driving can be considered to be the safe and smooth traffic on the road network for all road users. A joint activity also requires the existence of Common Ground, which for driving is based on the explicit rules of the Traffic Law but also on commonly accepted conventions, as argued in this thesis. It is also supported that when there is a risk for a breakdown of the Common Ground, when drivers are uncertain about others’ intent, they consciously seek to update and repair their Common Ground, trying to interact with other drivers, so as to communicate their motion intent and to agree on a safe future motion plan. Chapter 6 analyses how a behaviour which the observer can describe in semantic terms can be considered as a linguistic behaviour. Then, the Speech Act Theory of Austin (1962) and the classification of illocutionary acts by Searle (1975) are presented, which can be used for modelling non-verbal communicative acts, such as those studied in this thesis. In this framework, drivers’ communicative interactions can be modelled using the locutionary / illocutionary / perlocutionary typology by Austin. It is argued in this thesis that any communicative act in such interactions includes three types of acts, a "locutionary", an illocutionary and a perlocutionary one. The "locutionary" act conveys the sense and reference according to Austin. Such acts may be the use of the horn, the flashing of headlights, the lateral displacement of the vehicle towards the central lane marking or the deliberate close following of the lead vehicle. The illocutionary act conveys a certain force, for example “request” to empty the lane or “frightening” the lead “human-vehicle” so as to persuade him/her to change lane. The perlocutionary act is the act done due to the communicative act, for example the lead “human-vehicle” facilitates the overtaking or the lead “human-vehicle” empties the lane. A sequence of illocutionary acts in drivers’ communicative interactions is in this thesis modelled as a "Conversation" using the Linguistic Model of Drivers’ communicative Interactions (LMDI). In such an interaction, drivers use and interpret certain communicative acts or cues at the illocutionary level as "Directives", for example "requests" or "commands", and other acts or cues as "Commissives", for example "acceptances" or "rejections" of the "Directives". Regarding the non-verbal "locutionary" acts, the communication of intent between drivers can be mediated by different, formal and informal, communicative acts or cues. It is argued in this thesis that drivers collect information to anticipate the intent of other "human-vehicles" from two levels: a) the social level, which includes the explicit, intentional communicative acts emitted by a driver, and b) the physical level, which includes communicative acts emitted intentionally or cues used to interpret intent based on the observed motion of a "human-vehicle" on the road. Chapter 7 presents a first empirical verification of the LMDI based on observations of natural drivers’ interactions in real traffic conditions. The observations took place in the Hymettus ring road, a road with at least two lanes per direction and a central barrier. The drivers were asked to drive normally their own vehicle while in parallel commenting aloud about their observations in the surrounding traffic and any action undertaken by themselves as a result of any such observation. During the route one observer was seated in the passenger seat and recorded with two cameras the traffic scene in front and behind the vehicle and the driver’s commentary. The observations of 25 experienced drivers, 17 men and 8 women, were analysed. The findings support the argument that in many cases, drivers consider other vehicles as social units, as "animate human-vehicles", and largely base their expectations for the evolution of the traffic scene by observing and interpreting the behaviour of these social units. Indeed, on average in 38. 7 % of the uttered periods drivers referred to observations and interpretations of social behaviour of "animate human-vehicles". From the 360 periods referring to observations of social behaviour, 90 referred to anticipation of others’ intent. According to the analysis, in order to predict the future trajectory of a moving vehicle, a driver uses the physical geometry of the road and the physical limitations, assuming a smooth motion of the vehicles in the future. Any observed deviation of a vehicle from its expected smooth motion, is considered as a possible result of an intentional action by its particular driver and is used to anticipate intent of this “human-vehicle". These cues, which are created by observing inanimate objects, are supplemented by the cues emitted by the animate human drivers, and contribute to the anticipation of intent. In addition, the observer anticipates intent based on stereotypes. Furthermore, according to the analysis, the illocutionary force of acts within the observed interactions could be modelled as a "discussion" with a series of illocutionary acts, as represented by the LMDI. Empirical findings also support the argument that in cases of uncertainty, when the underlying Common Ground is not enough for safe prediction of the evolution of the traffic scene, drivers consciously seek to interact with other drivers, so as to communicate their intent, to update and repair their Common Ground and to agree on a safe future motion plan. Indeed, the analysis showed that most of the communicative interactions were initiated when one driver wished to change lane in the presence of another “human-vehicle” in the target lane or when one driver wished to drive faster than a lead “human-vehicle”. Finally, the observations were analysed separately for older and younger drivers. According to the analysis, older drivers face driving as a social phenomenon at the same level as younger drivers. However, the communicative acts and communicative interactions clearly tended to be less for older drivers. These findings support the argument that older drivers may adopt a strategy that allows them to avoid frequent communicative interactions, in order to compensate for their degraded abilities. Chapter 8 presents a first assessment of the effects from the integration of a manoeuvring negotiations unit based on the LMDI in DSAS. The assessment was based on an experiment using a dynamic driving simulator. Four different driving scenarios were algorithmically developed and four driving support systems were simulated, a system warning about collision risk during lane change on highways, a system warning about crash risk with the oncoming car in case of left turn on bi-directional urban road, a system warning about collision risk while entering a highway, and a system warning about crash risk with the oncoming car in case of overtaking on a rural road. For each system, two conditions were simulated. In the first condition, the warning was provided according to the calculated Time To Collision with the other vehicle involved in the manoeuvre, at two levels, high and medium risk. In the second condition, a manoeuvring negotiations unit, based on the LMDI, was additionally simulated. More precisely, the software simulated the “acceptance” by the other “driver” of the participant’s manoeuvring “request”, which was supposedly signalled by the activation of the turn indicator by the participant. The "acceptance" was signalled by an additional icon besides the collision risk icons which were displayed according to the Time To Collision value. The study revealed some effects on parameters relevant to traffic efficiency due the possibility of such negotiations. More specifically, in three of the four scenarios the participants started their manoeuvre earlier and at conditions of greater objective risk when there was the "explicit" consent of the other “driver” to their intended manoeuvre. This suggests that participants felt more confident when the system was providing the explicit "consent" of the other "driver" than when the warning was provided only in accordance to the laws of physics (i. e. the Time To Collision value). The found effects on driving behaviour and the subjective assessments of drivers as regards the functionality of the systems in both conditions support the argument that drivers feel more certain when there is the possibility of communicating with other drivers, i. e. when there is an explicit "consent" by others to their intended manoeuvre. The findings support the argument that the functionality of DSAS after the integration of a manoeuvring negotiations level is more in accordance with human assessments and expectations. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes the general conclusions of this thesis, and specifies directions for further research. The results of this thesis show that: (i) social interactions are and will remain an important component of the driving task and (ii) DSAS can be enriched by the integration of a social interactions level based on a model such as the LMDI. Such an endeavour, if successful, will ensure that the performance and functionalities of DSAS are more in accordance to that of the human driver and the human driver’s expectations. In the future, it will be necessary to collect further empirical data from communicative interactions through natural observations of more manoeuvre types in different traffic environments, so as to validate or expand the issues identified. Furthermore, future studies of such negotiations modules should involve two or more interacting human drivers and should record and analyse full cycles of communicative interactions in a more naturalistic setting, while experiments including automated vehicles should be also conducted. Future studies should also focus more specifically on the design of the manoeuvring negotiations module, i. e. how to handle cases when there will be no “response” to the manoeuvring “request” or when the observed behaviour of the vehicle is not in line with the expected one according to the “response” given to the manoeuvring “request”, so as to protect the whole system from any malicious or irresponsible use...|$|R
40|$|Technology advancements {{have allowed}} Navies {{worldwide}} to advance {{and try to}} stay {{one step ahead of}} non-allied nations, and having a weapon with greater range than the strongest weapon of a non-allied navy, or being able to detect a non-allied weapon at a larger range than their weapon will reach is of highest importance (Commander Pacific fleet; Lautenschlager 1983; Buck and Clavert 2008). Active SONAR has provided this solution and has remained the most valuable tool in our nation’s defense, particularly in anti-submarine warfare (Yusof and Kabir 2012; Commander Pacific Fleet; Buck and Clavert 2008; Kiamos 2002). Without the use of active SONAR the security of our nation, our fleets, and even national and international economies could be in jeopardy (Kiamos 2002; U. S. Fleet Forces Command; Krajewski 2008). But all of this good does not come free, active SONAR can have deleterious impacts on marine mammals (Ellison et al. 2011; Wiggins 2002; VanDyke 2004; VanDyke et al. 2004). Mass strandings are occurring more frequently and usually in spatial and temporal correlation to Naval SONAR exercises (Wiggins 2002; Parsons et al. 2008; Natural Resources Defense Council 2014). This paper delves into the current literature concerning the effects of Naval SONAR on marine mammals to present each stakeholder position in a non-biased manner. Literature was collected via search engines such as Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge, Web of Science, and EBSCOHost. Current regulations and environmental impact statements were found on the website for the Department of the Navy. Personal interviews were conducted along with questionnaires, in order to gain perspective into beliefs and thought processes of each stakeholder group. Sources were analyzed to find any correlations between the author affiliations, funding source, and publication to the conclusion and overall tone of the paper. The U. S. Navy stands strong behinds their mission and believes in doing everything possible to fulfill their charge of “maintaining, training, and equipping combat ready forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression, and maintaining the freedom of the seas,” which includes extending <b>warning</b> times and <b>distance</b> from adversaries (Kiamos 2002; U. S. Fleet Forces Command; Krajewski 2008). Technological advancements in weaponry and warfare have made active SONAR essential for national security (Commander Pacific Fleet). Research scientists focus their work on discovering the physiological effects and possible behavioral effects of SONAR on marine mammals. Studies have largely been conducted on the hearing thresholds, masking levels, and temporary and permanent threshold shifts for various species (Wright et al. 2007; Mooney et al. 2009 a, b; Southall et al. 2000). Responses, both behavioral and physiological, varied based on age, sex, current activity, health, and previous exposure, making it difficult to predict the true effects SONAR would have on marine mammals as a whole (Myrberg Jr. and Arthur 1990; NAP 2003; NRC 1994; Southall et al. 2000). Observed effects include respiratory changes, cardiac changes (NAP 2003), changes in dive behavior and resting behavior (Myrberg Jr. and Arthur 1990; NRC 1994; Mooney et al. 2009 a, b; Miller 2009), and decompression sickness (Jepson et al. 2003; Jepson et al. 2005; Cox et al. 2006; Fahlman et al. 2014). Environmental, political, and recreational stakeholders have long opposed the Navy’s used of active SONAR. These particular groups largely consist of members from the general public and publications produced consist of blogs and newspaper articles, with few scientific papers. They feel that SONAR is a valuable tool for national defense, but still feel that stricter regulations need to be in place to protect marine mammals. Lawsuits have been filed throughout the years in order to make this happen (Wiggins 2002; Parsons et al. 2008; Natural Resources Defense Council 2014). They raise concern over the current “safe decibel limit” of 180 dB re 1 μPa(“re 1 μPa” is used as the unit of measurement for sound underwater) and whether it is set too high or needs to be adjusted for different species (VanDyke et al. 2004; Parsons et al. 2008). Publication analysis revealed no correlation between the publication source (i. e. types of magazines or journals, etc.) and the conclusion or tone of the paper. There appeared to be a correlation between the author affiliations and the conclusion or tone of the paper. An even stronger correlation was found between the funding source and the conclusion or tone of the paper, as papers with Naval funding showed little to no effect of SONAR on marine mammals, conservationist funded work presented harsh effects, and funding sources from more neutral investors produced papers that typically fell in suite with the author affiliations. When analyzed together instead of individually, these factors played with or against each other and either strengthened or neutralized the tone of the paper. A comparison of references showed that there were common sources found amongst the stakeholders. Some were used in a select way that best supported the author’s intentions while others were used in the same manner by each group. The questionnaires revealed that stakeholders have very strong beliefs on this subject, but not all of them fall into the stereotyped thought process for their stakeholder group. More research is being done to examine this harmful relationship and how the varying factors interplay. But with published work largely showing bias, as seen by the literature analysis, people are being influenced to feel stronger support for one group or the other. Environmental, political, and recreational advocates have been opposing the Navy and taking them to court for years, and the navy has rebutted. While this debate rages on, harm is still being caused to both marine mammals and national security. This paper is an attempt to explain both standpoints in a fair manner while also providing unbiased research to show the information that each party needs to consider. Being able to see each stakeholder’s standpoint and understand why they feel the way they do is the first step to reaching a suitable compromise. After reviewing the literature and the main problems discussed about SONAR and marine mammals, recommendations were made on technologies {{that could be used to}} reduce SONAR’s deleterious impacts. While some of these tools are already in use, increased use and/or a “toolbox” approach with them could be used to reduce the amount of active SONAR being used. These resources include: passive SONAR, magnetic anomaly detection, unmanned vehicles, GIS, electromagnetic waves, advanced signal processing, increased environmental awareness, sniffers, and more, fully-trained, marine mammal scouts...|$|R
