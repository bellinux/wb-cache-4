Unicode includes these in its CJK Compatibility and letter-like symbols sub-ranges for back compatibility, <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> recommending future usage. These are summarised in Unicode symbols. The cursive ℓ, a letter-like symbol, {{has been used in}} a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre, but this is not currently recommended by any standards body.|$|E
5|$|Other French {{leaders were}} {{directly}} {{influenced by the}} text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The Manifesto of the Province of Flanders (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration; others include the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence (1811), the Liberian Declaration of Independence (1847), the declarations of secession by the Confederate States of America (1860–61), and the Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence (1945). These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> endorsing the political philosophy of the original.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E

5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> wanting a divorce.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{enlisted in}} the Maryland National Guard as a private in 1916 and served with it on the Mexican border and the Western Front during World War I before {{transferring}} to the United States Army Air Service. After the war, he obtained a regular commission. Already qualified as an aerial observer, he became a pilot in 1922. For many years he was an influential instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School. Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing {{was the most important}} aspect of air power. He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> having to destroy all of the factories. The doctrine which Wilson expounded later became the basis for AWPD-1, the Army Air Forces' strategic war plan developed in 1941.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Coptic and Old Catholic Churches {{consider}} this anointing to be a sacrament.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{establishing}} a new class of aggregation operators, which are close to the averaging, <b>without</b> being <b>necessarily</b> idempotent. An axiomatic approach is followed through the definition of crucial properties which characterize these aggregators, the mathematical consequences are illustrated and many examples that extend some important classical averaging operators are shown...|$|R

25|$|In {{the recent}} past, in the Roman Catholic Church {{the word was}} also applied to the {{renunciation}} of monastic vows (apostasis a monachatu), and to the abandonment of the clerical profession {{for the life of}} the world (apostasis a clericatu) <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> amounting to a rejection of Christianity.|$|E
50|$|In conclusion, even if {{education}} {{has no real}} contribution to the marginal product of the worker, {{the combination of the}} beliefs of the employer and the presence of signalling transforms the education level y* in a prerequisite for the higher paying job. It may appear to an external observer that {{education has}} raised the marginal product of labor, <b>without</b> this <b>necessarily</b> being true.|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} {{in the areas of}} abstract algebra known as universal algebra, group theory, ring theory, and module theory, a subdirect product is a subalgebra of a direct product that depends fully on all its factors <b>without</b> however <b>necessarily</b> being the whole direct product. The notion was introduced by Birkhoff in 1944 and {{has proved to be a}} powerful generalization of the notion of direct product.|$|R

25|$|Spines are {{particularly}} advantageous to neurons by compartmentalizing biochemical signals. This {{can help to}} encode changes {{in the state of}} an individual synapse <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> affecting the state of other synapses of the same neuron. The length and width of the spine neck has a large effect on the degree of compartmentalization, with thin spines being the most biochemically isolated spines.|$|E

One {{of a rare}} group of thermogenic plants, the dead horse arum can raise its temperature by thermogenesis. This helps to lure flies into the plant to contact its pollen. The plant still is being studied for {{the way it is}} able to produce its own heat <b>without</b> being <b>necessarily</b> dependent of ambient temperature.|$|R
25|$|Scholars like Sheldon Pollock {{have used}} the term Sanskrit Cosmopolis to {{describe}} the region and argued for millennium-long cultural exchanges <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> involving migration of peoples or colonisation. Pollock's 2006 book The Language of the Gods in the World of Men makes a case for studying the region as comparable with Latin Europe and argues that the Sanskrit language was its unifying element.|$|E
25|$|CMGs {{differ from}} {{reaction}} wheels. The latter apply torque simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's spin axis <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For {{a few hundred}} watts and about 100kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of newton meters of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require megawatts of power.|$|E
25|$|A torque is not {{necessarily}} limited to rotation around a fixed axis, however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the pivot's frame of reference. A net torque on a spinning body therefore {{may result in a}} precession <b>without</b> <b>necessarily</b> causing a change in spin rate.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{overcome}} adverse selection in labour market. One important mechanism is called signalling, pioneered by Michael Spence. In his classical paper on job signalling, Spence showed that even if formal education does not increase productivity, high-ability workers may still acquire it just to signal their abilities. Employers can then use education as a signal to infer worker ability and pay higher wages to better-educated workers. It may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labour, <b>without</b> this <b>necessarily</b> being true.|$|R
