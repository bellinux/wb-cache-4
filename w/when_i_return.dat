2500|$|Wen was [...] "discovered" [...] by then-general {{secretary}} Hu Yaobang, {{and joined}} the ranks of the Central Committee and Politburo. There was some public speculation after 1989 over whether Wen was closer to Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang, but Wen implicitly confirmed that he was a protégé of Hu by the release of his 2010 article, [...] "Recalling Hu Yaobang <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> to Xingyi". After Wen was promoted to work in Beijing, he served as Chief of the Party's General Affairs Office, an organ that oversaw day-to-day operations of the party's leaders. He remained in the post for eight years.|$|E

Whilst in Jena, Rivers became fluent in German and attended lectures, not only on psychology but on philosophy as well. He also became deeply immersed in the culture; in a diary he kept of the journey he comments on the buildings, the picture galleries, the church services, and the education system, showing his wide interests and critical judgement. In this diary he also wrote that: [...] "I have {{during the last three}} weeks {{come to the conclusion that}} I should go in for insanity <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> to England and work as much as possible at psychology." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, Garbo, then 20 {{and unable}} to speak English, was brought over from Sweden {{at the request of}} Mayer. Both Garbo and Stiller arrived in New York in July 1925 after a 10-day trip on the SS Drottningholm. But they {{remained}} in New York for more than six months without any word from MGM. They decided to travel to Los Angeles on their own, but another five weeks passed with no contact from the studio. On the verge of returning to Sweden, she wrote to her boyfriend back home: [...] "You're quite right when you think I don't feel at home here… Oh you lovely little Sweden, I promise that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> to you my sad face will smile as never before." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 2010 (the 21st {{anniversary of}} Hu's death), Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao {{wrote an article}} in the People's Daily titled [...] "Recalling Hu Yaobang <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> to Xingyi". Presented as an essay, it recollected an {{investigation}} of ordinary people's lives by Hu Yaobang and Wen Jiabao in Xingyi County, Guizhou, in 1986. Wen, who worked with Hu from 1985 to 1987, praised Hu's [...] "superior working style of being totally devoted to the suffering of the masses", and his [...] "lofty morality and openness [...] ". Wen's essay elicited an enthusiastic reaction in Chinese-language websites, generating over 20,000 responses on Sina.com on the day the article appeared. The article was interpreted by observers familiar with the Chinese political system as a confirmation by Wen that he was a protege of Hu, rather than Zhao Ziyang.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet {{him at the door}} when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, [...] "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which [...] "he [...] did to her as he had vowed." [...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{can also}} have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, Iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to appease Artemis so she would allow the Greeks to wage the Trojan War. According to the Bible, Jephthah vowed to devote to God the first creature {{to come out of}} his house to meet him if he won the battle against the Ammonites. Judges 11:30-31; [...] "And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>return</b> in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will Him a burnt offering." [...] His daughter was the first to come out and meet him. Judges 11:34; [...] "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter." [...] Although there is some uncertainty as to whether this was human sacrifice or consecration, academia discusses this in the context of human sacrifice, drawing parallels to Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
