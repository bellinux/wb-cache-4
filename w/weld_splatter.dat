50|$|Benefits of {{the process}} include its high metal {{deposition}} rates - it can lay metal at a rate between 15 and 20 kg per hour (35 and 45 lb/h) per electrode - {{and its ability to}} weld thick materials. Many welding processes require more than one pass for welding thick workpieces, but often a single pass is sufficient for electroslag welding. The process is also very efficient, since joint preparation and materials handling are minimized while filler metal utilization is high. The process is also safe and clean, with no arc flash and low <b>weld</b> <b>splatter</b> or distortion. Electroslag welding easily lends itself to mechanization, thus reducing the requirement for skilled manual welders.|$|E
5000|$|Bottom bracket taps {{and facing}} tools are tools used to tap or chase the threads {{in the bottom}} bracket shell and face the outside edges, respectively. A single tool will {{sometimes}} handle both jobs, and is usually suitable for light-duty bicycle shop use. A separate tap set and facing set is usually employed by frame builders where more robust tooling that is more frequently used is needed. Both tap sets and facing sets are intended for frame finishing work after welding and/or brazing, as the frame tubes tend to deform slightly after this process, and for cleaning out any <b>weld</b> <b>splatter</b> or paint from the bottom bracket threads. A bottom bracket tap set {{can be used to}} tap new threads in a blank bottom bracket shell (or for converting ISO threads to larger diameter Italian), but the process is slow and cumbersome and especially hard on most taps, particularly when tapping hard aluminum or titanium.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} sealing vacuum baked hybrids {{in a dry}} inert {{atmosphere}} using an overlapping spot resistance weld is described. A unique electrode configuration and fixturing that permits sealing of large and irregularly shaped gold plated Kovar packages to the hermeticity requirements of MIL-STD- 883 was discussed. Metallurgical considerations and comparisons to laser sealing were made. Problems encountered during the development and optimization of the process were highlighted. Solutions to plating, fixturing, warpage, <b>weld</b> <b>splatter</b> and cracked bead problems are presented...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of ILC SRF cavity R&D is to develop {{industrial}} capabilities of cavity manufacture and processing in all three regions. In the past several years, Jefferson Lab, in collaboration with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has processed and tested all the 9 -cell cavities of the first batch (4 cavities) and second batch (6 cavities) production cavities manufactured by Advanced Energy Systems Inc. (AES). Over the course, close information feedback was maintained, resulting in changes in fabrication and processing procedures. A light buffered chemical polishing was introduced, removing the <b>weld</b> <b>splatters</b> {{that could not be}} effectively removed by heavy EP alone. An 800 Celsius 2 hour vacuum furnace heat treatment procedure replaced the original 600 Celsius 10 hour procedure. Four out of the six 9 -cell cavities of the second production bath achieved a gradient of 36 - 41 MV/m at a Q 0 of more than 8 E 9 at 35 MV/m. This result validated AES as the first ''ILC certified'' industrial vendor in the US for ILC cavity manufacture...|$|R
40|$|The {{laser beam}} spot welding {{is a well}} known {{industrial}} process for contacting in electronics industry. The spot welding suffers the risk of <b>weld</b> <b>splatters</b> and melt ejections especially in welding of copper materials. The SHADOW® process with its advantages of low distortion and minimum contamination {{has been reported in}} previous presentations. This paper presents a new approach replacing a point by small circles. The reduction of the diameter of a circular weld seam to the dimensions of the focal diameter leads to lower stresses and therefore lower distortion. Additionally the required pulse energy could be reduced. In conclusion the new process allows a good control of the weld depth depending on the power of the laser pulse. The paper will conclude with two examples in the field of electronics and watch making industry. It will illustrate the capabilities of the process and the industrial application of SHADOW® welding for mass production: Laser beam welding has been chosen as joining technology for welding heatsinks (HS) to leadframes (LF). The welds are accomplished as circular SHADOW® -welds using a galvoscanner. The high welding speed and the low energy input reduces the stress and distortion in the components...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experience}} of ILC cavity processing and testing at Jefferson Lab {{has shown that}} some 9 -cell cavities are quench limited at a gradient {{in the range of}} 15 - 25 MV/m. Further studies reveal that these quench limits are often correlated with sub-mm sized and highly localized geometrical defects at or near the equator weld. There are increasing evidence to show that these genetic defects have their origin in the material or in the electron beam welding process (for example due to <b>weld</b> irregularities or <b>splatters</b> on the RF surface and welding porosity underneath the surface). A local defect removal method has been proposed at Jefferson Lab by locally re-melting the niobium material. Several 1 -cell cavities with known local defects have been treated by using the JLab local e-beam re-melting method, resulting in gradient and Q 0 improvement. We also sent 9 -cell cavities with known gradient limiting local defects to KEK for local grinding and to FNAL for global mechanical polishing. We report on the results of gradient improvements by removal of local defects in these cavities...|$|R
