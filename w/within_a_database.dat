25|$|Another example {{involves}} a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are {{not set up}} promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>database</b> logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.|$|E
25|$|Clark then {{registered}} as a doctoral student, being awarded a Hugo de Balsham studentship at Peterhouse from 1930 to 1932, {{and then a}} Bye Fellowship from 1932 to 1935. At Burkitt's suggestion, he devoted his thesis largely to the Mesolithic—or 'Middle Stone Age'—period of British prehistory. At the time little was known about Mesolithic Britain as few scholars had paid attention to it, {{and most of the}} archaeological evidence for it consisted of scattered flint tools. Burkitt served as his supervisor, although largely left Clark to his own devices. Clark initially familiarised himself with the evidence for Mesolithic society in continental Europe by travelling to Denmark and Sweden in 1929, where he had a chance meeting with Sophus Müller. On his return to Britain he began a systematic examination of Mesolithic stone tool collections that were held in both museums and private collections across the country, listing these many artefacts <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>database.</b> From this he was able to map the distribution of such Mesolithic tool assemblages across the island.|$|E
500|$|Another {{point of}} {{conflict}} concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open world assumption into it.

[...] This view assumes that the knowledge of the world stored <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>database</b> is complete. [...] Nulls, however, operate under the open world assumption, in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown, making the database's stored knowledge of the world incomplete.|$|E
