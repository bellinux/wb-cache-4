5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classical world.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E
