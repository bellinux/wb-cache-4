40|$|Most {{consumer}} durable {{products are}} used intermittently and the usage is best modelled {{as a point}} process in time. Also, the failure of an item {{is a function of}} the number of times the item has been used rather than its age. As a result, the item failure is better characterized through a discrete distribution. In this paper we develop a new model for item usage and item failure based on the above characterization and obtain the expected cost of servicing <b>warranty</b> <b>per</b> unit when the product is sold with warranty...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has usually assumed full execution of warranty if a product fails within the warranty time. This paper investigates {{the effect of}} warranty execution on the expected warranty reserves of a linear pro rata rebate plan. The failure distribution investigated includes the Weibull distribution with different parameter values. A weight function is used that depicts the effect of warranty execution. Several forms of this warranty execution modeling consumer behavior, which is influenced by {{factors such as the}} rebate plan, warranty time, product class, and warranty attrition, are studied. Expected present value of warranty reserves, by using a factor that includes the firm's discount rate and the general inflation rate, are found for the different warranty execution functions. The impact of the warranty execution function on the <b>warranty</b> reserves <b>per</b> unit is explored. The paper also investigates the effects of the model parameters, such as the failure distribution parameters and differences in consumer behavior in claiming warranties on <b>warranty</b> costs <b>per</b> unit. marketing, product warranty policy...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} warranty {{policy is}} characterized by a region in a two-dimensional plane with the horizontal axis representing time and the vertical axis the usage. In this paper, we study two-dimensional failure-free warranty policies for nonrepairable items that require the manufacturer to replace all items which fail under warranty by new ones at no cost to the buyer. We derive expressions for the expected <b>warranty</b> cost <b>per</b> item sold and for the expected life cycle cost for four different warranty regions. We illustrate these by numerical examples and discuss some resulting implications for the consumer and the manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{manufacturing}} variability, {{a fraction}} of the items produced are non-conforming - i. e. they do not meet the design specifications. The performance of a non-conforming item is inferior to that of a conforming item which meets the design specification. When items are sold with warranty, the warranty cost to service non-conforming items is much bigger than that for conforming items. The production of non-conforming items can be controlled through lot sizing. Smaller lot size results in a reduction in the <b>warranty</b> cost <b>per</b> item but this is achieved at the expense of increased manufacturing cost per unit. In this paper, we discuss the optimal lot sizing which achieves a proper trade-off between the two costs for repairable items sold with free replacement warranty (FRW) policy...|$|R
40|$|Vendor-buyer {{models for}} trade credit {{issues in the}} {{existing}} literature always consider the items produced as perfect. However, a number of items in a lot may be of imperfect quality. This paper extends Chen and Kang's [2007. Integrated vendor-buyer cooperative models with variant permissible delay in payments. European Journal of Operational Research 183 (2), 658 - 673] study to develop integrated vendor-buyer models that consider a permissible delay in payment and imperfect quality to determine the optimal solutions of the buyer's order quantity and the frequency for each vendor's production run. To establish a cooperative relationship between the vendor and buyer for a win-win situation, a simple solution algorithm is presented to determine the cost saving of each side when the <b>warranty</b> cost <b>per</b> unit is increased. A numerical example is used to illustrate {{the results for the}} proposed models. Inventory Imperfect items Vendor-buyer Delay in payment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a replacement-repair model is {{developed}} {{to study a}} renewing free replacement warranty (RFRW) for a class of multi-state deteriorating repairable products. After a replacement, the product warranty is renewed. Two parameters affect the manufacturerâ€™s decision to minimally repair or replace a failed item: the product deterioration level {{at the time of}} failure and the remaining warranty time. We derive an optimal replacement-repair policy to minimise the expected <b>warranty</b> servicing cost <b>per</b> item sold. In the case of a product with two different working states, we are able to explicitly find the optimal values of the replacement-repair parameters using the Adomian decomposition method. In general, for N> 2, it is impossible to find the optimal parameter values analytically. Hence, a computational procedure for finding these optimal values is proposed. For more clarification, numerical examples are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Duke University {{is home to}} {{an array}} of venues that utilize High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps for {{lighting}} during intercollegiate play. Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps are emerging as {{a viable alternative to}} HID as they are able to offer much smaller wattage per unit, a wider variety of color temperature, and comparable illuminance. While sold at much higher prices than HID equivalents, LED solutions are able to compete financially as they can provide longer lamp life hours, increased reliability/durability, and reduced maintenance costs with fewer fixtures. After a successful pilot LED retrofit project at Williams Field, Duke Athletics became interested in identifying which venues represent the highest amount of savings associated with a retrofit. Working with Duke Facilities Management Department, I have developed a unique financial model to retrofit 20 specific facilities on campus across three different warranty periods accompanied with an abatement curve identifying the Net Present Value per kWh saved allowing Duke Athletics to make a financially optimal decision by prioritizing venues with the largest return and quickest payback <b>per</b> <b>warranty</b> selected...|$|R
40|$|When a {{repairable}} product under warranty fails, {{the manufacturer}} (warrantor) has {{the choice to}} either repair or replace the failed product. When repairing a failed product, the degree of repair which affects the working condition of the product can vary, and this is assumed {{to have an impact}} on the cost of the repair. The main motivation of this study is to develop a warranty repair strategy that minimizes the costs associated with servicing the warranty. In this research, the product coverage is represented by a two-dimensional rectangular region with a free-replacement warranty. We propose an imperfect repair strategy that suggests employing imperfect repairs of a predefined degree, in prespecified subregions of the warranty region. The aim is to then minimize the expected warranty servicing cost to the manufacturer by determining the optimal partitioning of the warranty region for the chosen degrees of repair. Two imperfect repair models are considered, and for both, the expressions for the distribution of the times to imperfect repair and the expected <b>warranty</b> servicing cost <b>per</b> product sold are derived. We numerically illustrate our findings and compare the expected costs of the proposed imperfect repair strategy with those of previously developed repair-replacement warranty strategies...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{warranties}} {{have become}} more important in deciding the overall product quality. In this thesis, we use warranty as the planning tool to improve product quality during the customer phase. We develop an analytical framework that consists of systematic planning methods {{to reduce the cost}} of warranty program operations. These planning methods are related through a warranty program cost and revenue structure. Based on such structure, each method is designed to either reduce one type of cost or to enhance the warranty revenue. ^ In chapter 2, we develop a method of reducing maintenance cost through warranty policy design. The method is featured by an embedded incentive for cooperative maintenance, of which the traditional warranty is a special case. We consider the nonrenewable and renewable incentives, and study the conditions under which the incentive is effective. The nonrenewable incentive takes form of a conditional rebate or one-time extended warranty with equivalent cost, while the renewable takes form of renewable extended warranty. Under certain assumptions, the renewable can be treated with a Markov decision approach. ^ In chapter 3, we develop a planning method that utilizes a recent result in maintenance research to enhance warranty revenue. Specifically, this method integrates cost-variability-sensitive maintenance into extended warranty planning. We find an upper bound for the acceptable warranty fee by a mixed criterion of expected cost and weighted cost variability. Using this upper bound, we develop a charge schedule for extended warranties. In addition, we study the cost-variation control for the customer. ^ Chapter 4 gives a method on reducing economic cost in warranty reserve management. Considering the economic costs as holding cost and penalty cost, the method focuses on adjusting warranty reserve over time. Instead of estimating <b>warranty</b> reserve <b>per</b> unit sold, we give a volume-based reserve solution for a growing sales process of homogeneous products. ^ Chapter 5 concludes the thesis with summary and future work. Generally, this framework stems from the philosophy that warranty feedback can be used for quality assessment and improvement. Via quality improvement purpose, it relates the paradigm of warranty, reliability and quality together in the customer phase. ...|$|R
