40|$|Difussion of {{moisture}} through air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges in buiding walls {{has been studied}} using two kinds of test methods. Diffussion rate {{of moisture}} through air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges is represented by equivalent vapor transmission coefficient. Consideration {{have been given to}} moisture distribution in the air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges. The results are shown that these test methods and the diffussion rate of moisture through air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges are satisfactory. The experimental results indicate that the air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges of thickness not less than 2 cm have enough the effect of removal moisture when the height of the air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges is 1. 8 m. These test methods {{can be applied to the}} methods for water vapor permeance of the actual size walls. The agreement between the measured and calculated value is good when diffusion of moisture in the air layers <b>with</b> <b>opened</b> edges is calculated using MAC method...|$|R
