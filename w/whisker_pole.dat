5000|$|A {{spinnaker}} pole is a spar used in sailboats (both dinghys and yachts) {{to help support}} and control a variety of headsails, particularly the spinnaker. However, it is also used with other sails, such as genoas and jibs, when sailing downwind with no spinnaker hoisted. (Since the load on a {{spinnaker pole}} is very light on this point of sailing, sometimes a special light spinnaker pole called a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> is used in these circumstances.) ...|$|E
50|$|Sailing off the wind, {{weather helm}} {{may be caused}} by the {{imbalance}} due to fore-and-aft sails all being sheeted out on the same (leeward) side of the boat. Raising a spinnaker or poling out a headsail to windward with a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> can help. Yachts making ocean trade wind crossings have rigged 'twins' - double headsails poled out to opposite sides from the same forestay for extended downwind passages without a mainsail. Square rigged sails also provide relatively symmetric drive off the wind.|$|E
50|$|When running, the {{mainsail}} is eased out {{as far as}} it will go. The jib will collapse {{because the}} mainsail blocks its wind, and must either be lowered and replaced by a spinnaker, or set instead on the windward side of the sailing craft. Running with the jib to windward is known as 'gull wing', 'goose wing', 'butterflying' or 'wing and wing'. A genoa gull-wings well, especially if stabilized by a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole,</b> which is similar to but lighter than a spinnaker pole.|$|E
50|$|The hullform is {{designed}} for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker-built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun-shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, <b>whisker</b> and spinnaker <b>poles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sonar showcased {{disabled}} sailing at the 1996 Paralympic Games {{where the}} sport was a demonstration event {{with just the}} Sonar. The Sonar has been the three person keelboat at every subsequent Paralympics. When being sailed by disabled it is crewed by 3, and sailed without a spinnaker. Instead, when running downwind a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> is used to hold the jib out to windward for maximum exposed sail area. The Sonar is well suited for disabled sailing because of its large open cockpit making adaptations easy.|$|E
5000|$|When running (sailing nearly {{directly}} downwind) in a sloop, one may 'jibe' {{only the}} mainsail {{to the opposite}} side of the boat. This keeps both the main and jib exposed to the wind resulting in a more efficient use of wind. Setting the mainsail and the jib on opposite sides of the boat is often referred to as running [...] "goose-winged", [...] "gull-winged", or [...] "wing-and-wing". When running wing-and-wing, a light spinnaker pole or <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> is often used to hold the clew of the foresail out to the windward side of the boat.|$|E
50|$|The Y Flyer class {{requires}} {{boats to}} weigh at least 500 pounds fully rigged, without crew or sails, and to carry class-approved upwind sails measuring 161 sq ft (14.9 m2). The Canadian Y-Flyer class {{allows for a}} spinnaker to be used downwind. The American Y-Flyer class rules forbid the use of spinnakers. When racing against non-class sailboats, the Y-Flyer uses a Portsmouth Yardstick rating of 86.5. The boat sailing characteristics are similar to other fast planing performance boats, but the Y Flyer is notable for having a bluntly squared-off fore-deck and using a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> nearly half {{the length of the}} boat when setting the jib for running downwind.|$|E
50|$|The junk rig {{typically}} {{produces more}} drive than a similarly sized Bermuda rig when running downwind without a spinnaker. A junk rigged boat can let its sails out athwartships (and beyond.) On a Bermuda rigged boat the shrouds interfere with sails if the sail was let out {{until it was}} athwartship. The full battens of a junk sail prevent the sail from collapsing when running in light wind (dispensing {{with the need for}} a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole.)</b> On double-masted junk rigged boats, the sails can be flown wing-and-wing (i.e. {{on opposite sides of the}} boat) even when on a broad reach as can a Bermudan rig. The junk rig is well suited to downwind travel with its working sails.|$|E
50|$|It is sloop-rigged, with a {{mainsail}} {{larger in}} proportional size {{than any other}} boat of its length. Unlike most modern racing boats, it does not use a spinnaker when sailing downwind. Instead, when running downwind a <b>whisker</b> <b>pole</b> is used to hold the jib out to windward for correct wind flow. Early Stars were built from wood, but modern boats are generally made of fiberglass. The boat must weigh at least 671 kg with a maximum total sail area of 26.5 m2.The Star class pioneered an unusual circular boom vang track, which allows the vang to effectively hold the boom down even when the boom is turned far outboard on a downwind run. Another notable aspect of Star sailing is the extreme hiking position adopted by the crew and at times the helmsman, who normally use a harness to help hang low off the windward {{side of the boat}} with only their lower legs inside.|$|E
