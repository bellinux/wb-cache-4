2500|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, {{as it became}} clear that metals gained mass when they were oxidized, phlogiston was {{increasingly}} regarded as a principle rather than a material substance. [...] By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, for the few chemists who still used the term phlogiston, the concept was linked to hydrogen. [...] Joseph Priestley, for example, in referring to the reaction of steam on iron, while fully acknowledging that the iron gains mass as it binds with oxygen to form a calx, iron oxide, iron also loses “the basis of inflammable air (hydrogen), and this is the substance or principle, to which <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> name phlogiston.” [...] Following Lavoisier’s description of oxygen as the oxidizing principle (hence its name, from Ancient Greek: oksús, “sharp”; génos, “birth”, referring to oxygen's role in the formation of acids), Priestley described phlogiston as the alkaline principle.|$|E

2500|$|Ian Brodie (Chief of Staff in Stephen Harper's Prime Minister's Office), {{during the}} media lockup for the February 26, 2008, budget, stopped {{to chat with}} several journalists and was {{surrounded}} by a group from CTV. The conversation turned to the pledges to renegotiate NAFTA made by the two Democratic contenders, Obama and Clinton. Brodie, apparently seeking to play down the potential impact on Canada, told the reporters that the threat was not serious and that someone from Clinton's campaign had even contacted Canadian diplomats to tell them not to worry because the NAFTA threats were mostly political posturing. The Canadian Press news agency quoted that source as saying that Brodie said that someone from Clinton's campaign called and was [...] "telling the embassy to take it with a grain of salt". The Clinton campaign denied it. [...] "We flatly deny the report," [...] said Clinton spokesperson Phil Singer. [...] "We did not sanction nor would we ever sanction anyone to say any such a thing. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Canadian government blanket immunity to reveal the name of anyone in the Clinton campaign think they heard from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Significant edits {{were made}} to {{aggressive}} and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. [...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line [...] "It doesn't matter [...] faggot" [...] was also censored from [...] "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.|$|E
2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E
