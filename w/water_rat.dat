5|$|Muskrats {{are found}} {{over most of}} Canada and the United States and {{a small part of}} {{northern}} Mexico. They were introduced to Europe {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They mostly inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|More {{specialized}} carnivores {{include the}} shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian <b>water</b> <b>rat,</b> which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, {{and other small}} mice, and {{only a small part}} of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species such}} as tree {{squirrels}} and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell {{on the surface of}} the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.|$|E

25|$|The earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> and Baiyankamys {{are related}} because {{they share the}} {{following}} characters: tail much longer than head-body length; soft, thick, greyish dorsal coat; long, narrow rostrum with a narrow top; very narrow canines; very narrow mesopterygoid fossae; narrow zygomatic arches with a high squamosal root. B. habbema also has the reduced external ears of the earless <b>water</b> <b>rat.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the attacks the Indian news channel CNN-IBN re-aired a {{programme}} called Operation <b>Water</b> <b>Rat,</b> which they had initially aired in February 2006 and which revealed lapses in Indian maritime security.

25|$|The earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> (Crossomys moncktoni) is a New Guinea rodent, {{part of the}} Hydromys {{group of}} the {{subfamily}} of Old World rats and mice (Murinae). It is the only species of the genus Crossomys. This species is probably most closely related to Baiyankamys. It is still unclear to which species this group is related.

Mokkan escapes in a boat, but an escaped slave, whom we find out is Nettlebud, throws a chain at him and knocks him into the lake, where he is eaten by pike.|$|E

25|$|Since the 19th century, {{many people}} from other {{countries}} including Italy, Germany and Ireland have also emigrated and intermarried with the local population in certain areas, {{but some of the}} Isleños are solely descended from Canarians, such as many Isleños in Delacroix Island, Yscloskey, Shell Beach, Reggio, Poydras and Violet. Whether fully or partially descended from Canarians, the Isleño community acts as one. Depending on the season, the Isleños are <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> trappers, hunters of alligators, oysters and crabs, and fishermen. The Isleños of Louisiana are very family oriented and, like their ancestors, profess Roman Catholicism.|$|E
25|$|Redwall {{appeared}} {{to take place}} in the real world. Cluny was referred to as a Portuguese <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> at one point. Additionally, Methuselah claimed that one of the accounts of Cluny comes from a town dog. The horse present in the early chapters {{was the size of a}} normal horse, and the wagon it pulled was scaled to the same size – an entire army of rats was able to ride in it. Also there was a mention of cows that trampled through a village. However, Brian Jacques did not expect the book to be published, and excluded references to humans and many larger animals in later books.|$|E
25|$|The earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> {{is adapted}} best {{to a life}} in water {{out of all the}} muroids. It has {{extremely}} long hindfeet, the toes of which are webbed completely, strongly reduced forelegs, absent or invisible ears, very small eyes, and a long tail with a row of hairs at the downside. That row starts at each side of the beginning of the tail as a long white row of hairs; these two rows merge at about 50mm {{from the beginning of the}} tail and the row goes on to the end of the tail. In all these characters, it resembles the elegant water shrew (Nectogale elegans), a good example of convergent evolution.|$|E

2500|$|This {{animal was}} first {{described}} in 1907 by the British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas, {{based on a}} single specimen caught by one Mr. C. A. W. Monckton, after whom the species was named, near Brown River, Central Province, south-east Papua New Guinea. Only in July 1950 a second specimen was captured. Since then, several other examples have {{been caught in the}} mountains of eastern New Guinea, but the earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> remains a rather rare species. The scientific name means [...] "Monckton's fringed mouse", which refers to the collector of the original specimen (C. A. W. Monckton) and to the fringe of hairs on the tail.|$|E
2500|$|The back is greyish brown, and {{the belly}} is white. The fur {{is soft and}} waterproof. The {{top half of the}} tail is light grey, and the bottom half is white. The forefeet and claws are very small, but the hindfeet are very large. The upper lip {{contains}} a row of short, strong brushes, which may be used for rasping. The external ear (the pinna) is reduced to a small oval that does not or hardly protract above the fur. It is possible that the ear canal can be closed. The brain is rather large, like in many aquatic animals. The nasals are relatively small, just like the palate and the molars. The bullae are small. The rostrum is narrow. The earless <b>water</b> <b>rat</b> is a medium-sized rat, about as large as its close relative Baiyankamys. The head-body length is [...] (based on four specimens), tail length is [...] (4), hind foot length is [...] (4), ear length is [...] (2), and weight 165 g (5.8 ounce avoirdupois) (1). Females have 0+2=4 mammae (no thoracic and two [...] pairs), the same number as most other Australasian rodents.|$|E

There, hidden behind the osiers, we would play at banquets, he, it is true, doing most of the banqueting, and I the make-believe. But it was a good game; added to which it was the only game I could ever get him to play, though I tried. He was a one-ideaed rat.|$|E
