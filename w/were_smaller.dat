5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E

5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than the hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), {{the largest of}} which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Scotland was {{targeted}} by Nazi Germany {{largely due to}} its factories, ship yards and coal mines.http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/primaryhistory/world_war2/scotlands_blitz/ Cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh were targeted by German bombers, as <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|The Bayan class {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the previous Russian armored cruisers, as they <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> ships designed to serve as scouts for the fleet rather than as commerce raiders. Authorized in the 1896–1902 building program, the design was outsourced to a French shipyard, Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée, because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Negotiations began in March 1897, and a contract was signed in May 1898 for one ship with delivery in 36 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than their contemporaries due to {{limitations}} imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed {{under the supervision of}} Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, the namesake of the lead ship, and Benedetto Brin. Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were not strong enough to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth held together with plaster of Paris.

Two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen (which was added at a later date), and the servants' dining room are in the north wing, while the south wing has three bedrooms and the family dining room. The house is topped by a cupola from which bullfights and festivals in the adjacent plaza could be seen.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than the modern hippopotamus, likely {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} at least twice that of the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active.

5|$|Approximately 50percent of midshipmen {{were the}} sons of {{professional}} men, which included {{the sons of}} naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27percent of officers. The numbers <b>were</b> <b>smaller,</b> but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, {{and they had a}} considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785. The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these <b>were</b> <b>smaller</b> in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
