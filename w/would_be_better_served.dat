5|$|Orélie-Antoine {{felt that}} the {{indigenous}} peoples <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> in negotiations with the surrounding powers by a European leader, and was accordingly elected {{by a group of}} Mapuche loncos (chieftains) to be their king. He made efforts to gain international recognition, and attempted to involve the French government in his project, but these efforts proved unsuccessful: the French consul concluded that Tounens was insane, and Araucania and Patagonia was never recognized by any country. The Chileans primarily ignored Orélie-Antoine and his kingdom, at least initially, and simply went on with the occupation of the Araucanía, a historical process which concluded in 1883 with Chile establishing control over the region. In the process, Orélie-Antoine was captured in 1862, and imprisoned in an insane asylum in Chile. After several fruitless attempts to return to his kingdom (thwarted by Chilean and Argentine authorities), Tounens died penniless in 1878 in Tourtoirac, France. The current pretender, Prince Antoine IV, lives in France. The previous pretender renounced his claims to the Patagonian throne, even though a few Mapuches continue to recognise the Araucanian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E

5000|$|In 1896 Bissell {{published}} an essay called The Mistaken Vocation of Shakespeare's Heroines, taking {{the form of}} a report of a lecture to suffragettes. The purported speaker launches an attack on the Elizabethan playwright Shakespeare for placing his female characters in unsuitable situations, where they are not allowed to demonstrate their true abilities. For example, instead of having Ophelia as his wife, Hamlet <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> much <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by the more forceful Lady Macbeth, while Macbeth himself <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by Portia.The audience greets her attack on Shakespeare with delight, ending up shouting [...] "Down with Shakespeare".The spoof was supposed to show that it was absurd for women to seek careers.|$|R

25|$|While {{developing}} a new disruptive camouflage in the 2000, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) evaluated over 100 existing patterns, and judged Rhodesian Brushstroke {{to be one of}} the three best schemes previously developed, along with CADPAT and tigerstripe. None of the candidates were adopted because there was some indication that Marines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by something more distinctive than a preexisting design. The MARPAT digital camouflage eventually introduced by the USMC in 2002 remains in use today, and blends elements from all three camouflages.|$|E

Wests Tigers then allocated all NRL contracted players to the Balmain Tigers (the Wests Magpies had six junior players in that group, as opposed to one from Balmain), citing the advantages of both the NRL and NSW Cup teams training together at Concord Oval. This continued from 2006 to 2007.|$|E

40|$|People {{increasingly}} generate {{content on}} their mobile devices and upload it to third-party {{services such as}} Facebook and Google Latitude for sharing and backup purposes. Although these services are convenient and useful, their use has important privacy implications due to their centralized nature and their acquisitions of rights to user-contributed content. This paper argues that people’s interests <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by uploading their data to a machine that they themselves own and control. We term these machines Virtual Individual Servers (VISs) because our preferred instantiation is a virtual machine running in a highly-available utility computing infrastructure. By using VISs, people can better protect their privacy because they retain ownership of their data and remain in control over the software and policies that determine what data is shared with whom. This paper also describes a range of applications of VIS proxies. It then presents our initial implementation and evaluation {{of one of these}} applications, a decentralized framework for mobile social services based on VISs. Our experience so far suggests that building such applications on top of the VIS concept is feasible and desirable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{create and}} analyse a {{long-term}} history for {{various types of}} equity investment that are protected against downside risk. To do this, we estimate the performance achievable by employing modern investment technologies and markets, such as purchasing or dynamically creating portfolio insurance. We report the returns and risks that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> experienced by a tax-exempt investor following these strategies, before deduction of management fees. We conclude that protected portfolios are relatively unattractive for the long-term investor, who <b>would</b> typically <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by multi-asset diversification than by purchasing short-term portfolio insurance...|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s NSB {{started working}} on plans rebuild the Østfold Line between Ski Station and Moss Station. Originally {{the idea was to}} simply place a second track next to the first. But it soon became evident that the railway <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> if a new route was selected, which allowed for higher speeds. Originally Kjenn Station north of Hobøl was {{proposed}} {{as the end of the}} double track, but NSB extended their plans. A new route was proposed between Rustad Station and Sonsveien Station which would place the line further west, avoiding the village of Hobøl. It would also allow the line to be built next to European Road E6. Construction was approved in 1989. A major part structure on the segment past Hølen was Hølendalen Bridge, a concrete structure which replaces the original viaduct.|$|E
25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, of all {{the current}} {{newspapers}} published within Cornwall, only one is independent, the St. Ives Times & Echo, which formed out of the merger of Western Echo and the St. Ives Times in 1972. All of the others are either owned by Tindle Newspaper Group, Newsquest or Northcliffe Newspapers Group. The geographical coverage of the existing papers is also haphazard, {{with a lot of}} duplication (for example, Callington is covered by the East Cornwall Times, The Cornish Times and the Cornish & Devon Post) while some areas (particularly North Cornwall/Bude) are poorly served (just the North Cornwall edition of the St Austell centric Cornish Guardian). There is an argument that Cornwall <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>served</b> having at least one weekly paper which covers the entire county, as {{one of the main reasons}} for purchasing the weekly paper is by prospective property buyers and people buying and selling cars and job seekers. Indeed, The West Briton has gone some way to accommodate this; although there are four separate news editions of the paper, each week a classified/job vacancy section and a property section cover all of mid and west Cornwall, though places east of Bodmin, for no known reason, are generally excluded.|$|E
