5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b> Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, Sir Robert Peel, the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b>|$|E
25|$|They Liberals {{also warned}} of a {{possible}} minority government between Labor and the Greens, claiming it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for Tasmania: this campaign may have backfired on the Liberals by encouraging voters to support a majority Labor government. The Liberals abandoned their 1998 commitment to sell Hydro Tasmania. On the issue of health Hidding promised to resign {{if he did not}} cut waiting lists by 20% in one year. The Liberals also promised to abolish Land Tax.|$|E

5000|$|A raise of five {{does not}} mean {{anything}} more than unwillingness to pass, if the bid is below 160. Above 160, a raise of 5 means that being the declarer <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 8. Environmentally friendly. An [...] "alcohol spill" [...] <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> like <b>an</b> oil spill. Alcohol dissolves {{in water}} and is readily {{consumed}} by bacteria. Within {{a few days of}} an Exxon-sized ethanol or methanol spill, the ocean <b>would</b> <b>be</b> back to normal.|$|R
25|$|The 2015 season, {{which began}} with high hopes, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b> After {{dropping}} their first three, UCF lost to South Carolina by a score of 31-14 on September 26 to fall to 0–4. Following UCF's 59–10 loss to Houston on homecoming, dropping the Knights to an 0–8 record to start the 2015 season, O'Leary resigned as head football coach. Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett was named interim head coach and led the team for the remaining four games of the season. UCF finished the 2015 season at a winless 0–12, its third such campaign in program history.|$|E
25|$|Details of the {{proposed}} closure were published on 18 October when notices appeared at Rowfant, Grange Road, Forest Row, Hartfield and Withyham stations. Objections were invited by the South Eastern Transport Users' Consultative Committee. A public meeting was called by the East Grinstead Urban District Council at which the general sentiment was that the closure <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for East Grinstead. It was accepted that the line to the east could not be saved, but that a stand should {{be made for the}} East Grinstead - Three Bridges section. The Council resolved to urge the Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, to refuse consent to closure.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts {{had become}} a {{phenomenon}} worldwide by the mid-1960s, and the special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. It was written {{over a period of}} several weeks, and animated on a shoestring budget in only six months. In casting the characters, the producers went an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox: it features a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi. Its absence of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and network to wrongly predict the project <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> preceding its broadcast.|$|E
50|$|Doctor Livesey, {{though at}} one point earning a merited rebuke from Captain Smollett for {{inattention}} to his post, likely has the largest share {{of the credit for}} the expeditions success.

25|$|Hitler {{was intent}} on invading Poland, though Galeazzo Ciano warned this would likely lead to war with the Allies. Hitler {{dismissed}} Ciano's comment, predicting that instead that Britain and the other Western countries would back down, and he suggested that Italy should invade Yugoslavia. The offer was tempting to Mussolini, but at that stage a world war <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for Italy as the armaments situation from building the Italian Empire thus far was lean. Most significantly, Victor Emmanuel had demanded neutrality in the dispute. Thus when World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland eliciting {{the response of the}} United Kingdom and France declaring war on Germany, Italy did not become involved in the conflict. However, when the Germans incarcerated 183 professors from Jagiellonian University in Kraków on 6 November 1939, Mussolini personally intervened to Hitler against this action, leading to the freeing of 101 Poles.|$|E
25|$|Erhard Milch, {{responsible}} for production, warned the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command or OKW) that the Soviet Union {{could not be}} defeated in 1941. He called for winter preparations and increases in production in the expectation {{the war in the}} East, even if successful, would last several years. Joseph Schmid, senior intelligence officer and Otto Hoffmann von Waldau, Luftwaffe chief of operations, were also opposed to Barbarossa. Schmid still felt the Luftwaffe could defeat Britain by attacking its industries, while Waldau argued that dissipating German air strength along a wide ‘air front’ was deeply irresponsible. Waldau's continuing realism and non-concealed criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership and its prosecution of the war, led him to being removed from his post in 1942. Milch’s skepticism soon became despair. He convinced himself a war in the East <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> and did everything he could to influence Göring to persuade Hitler not go ahead with Barbarossa. Initially, Göring kept his word, and argued that pursuing a strategy in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, particularly in conjunction with the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) against Gibraltar, while weakening the British hold on the eastern Mediterranean would be the most ideal strategy. Hitler dismissed this. Hitler also dismissed the Kriegsmarine’s objections that it was the British and their shipping lanes that was the main enemy.|$|E
500|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} {{a priest in}} Mexico predicted that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> before the ships set sail, but that his warning was ignored. The four ships left Vera Cruz on 9 April 1554, carrying over 400 people and valuable treasure and cargo. [...] The passengers included wealthy citizens, merchants and former soldiers, {{but there were also}} a few prisoners and five Dominican missionaries who had decided to return to Spain. The ships carried barrels holding over [...] of silver coins and disks that had been minted in Mexico City.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pause of consternation, as Lieutenant Ribouville spoke. Here {{was the end}} of {{the grand}} scheme, from which they had {{expected}} so much. At this time, the Germans had no other line of rail at their command; and the destruction of the tunnel <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> equal to that of the loss of a pitched battle.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Plekhanov became an outspoken supporter of the Entente powers, for which he <b>was</b> derided as <b>a</b> so-called [...] "Social Patriot" [...] by Lenin and his associates. Plekhanov was convinced that German imperialism was at fault for the war and {{he was convinced that}} German victory in the conflict <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unmitigated <b>disaster</b> for the European working class.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, however, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>disaster</b> for Hoying {{as he was}} benched midseason after {{not winning}} a single game as a starter. He did not throw a touchdown pass and threw nine interceptions. The 3-13 season led to the firing of Eagles head coach Ray Rhodes, and ultimately the hiring of Andy Reid. Reid drafted Donovan McNabb out of Syracuse University, and traded Hoying.|$|R
500|$|The {{potential}} {{dangers of}} the building were apparent to some, as no fire stops or party walls {{were present in the}} building to slow the progress of a fire. In the late eighteenth century a committee of MPs predicted that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> if the palace caught fire. This was followed by a 1789 report from fourteen architects warning against the possibility of fire in the palace; signatories included Soane and Robert Adam. Soane again warned of the dangers in 1828, when he wrote that [...] "the want of security from fire, the narrow, gloomy and unhealthy passages, and the insufficiency of the accommodations in this building are important objections which call loudly for revision and speedy amendment." [...] His report was again ignored.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie's Dear Brutus, another Importance of Being Earnest in the West End, and Macbeth on tour. Returning, {{with more}} {{assurance}} than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and Michael Wilding singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had striven to {{keep the}} Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a {{condition}} of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> {{you would have to}} spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." [...] It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, [...] "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{location}} of the bus depot (on {{the banks of the}} river, and near the Nizammuddin Bridge) was the subject of major controversy from environmentalists. Multiple NGOs and RTI activists strongly protested the {{location of}} the depot, citing that it violated Constitutional arrangements about protecting the environment. In addition, petitioners pointed out that the depot's location <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> environmental <b>disaster,</b> as the area <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important water recharge area and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> active floodplain.|$|R

500|$|Elías also {{discussed}} the three different strategies seen within the independence movement, electoral participation, civil mobilization and clandestine struggle. Ojeda Ríos reaffirmed his stance that independence {{would not be}} achieved in elections, but conceded that things beneficial to it could be, suggesting that the electoral opposition needed to [...] "radicalize" [...] its opposition and asking Rúben Berrios to discuss his differences with other organizations within the independence movement. On the other hand, he expressed that the civil society was progressing slowly {{due to a lack}} of leadership and coherence. Ojeda Ríos justified the vigency of armed resistance, also distancing itself from terrorism, dictatorship or coups. He {{also discussed}} his close friendship with Rafael Cancel Miranda and confided that the EPB had been covertly publishing documents about armed resistance that in his view were gathering this tactic support from the public. When questioned by Elías about the reason behind the move from a mostly paramilitary strategy to also include activism, Ojeda Ríos quoted that several other armed organizations had spent prolonged periods in preparation before stricking, citing 15 years of inactivity by the zapatistas while it gathered the support of Amerindian groups, the initial movements in Vietnam during the 1930s and the organization of the French Revolution as examples. Ojeda Ríos gave his opinion of then-Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño to this journalist, labeling him as [...] "a person with no dignity", [...] "who is totally submitted to the will of the United States government" [...] and [...] "does not make decisions that favor the people". He concluded by stating that future political aspirations by the functionary would be [...] "a calamity" [...] and that [...] "having Fortuño as a governor <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> [...] ".|$|E
