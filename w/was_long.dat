5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it <b>was</b> <b>long.</b> The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, it <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{a component of}} low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} <b>was</b> <b>long</b> neglected, {{the discovery}} of homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram. The Tungidae, including the harmful chigoe flea or jigger, is sister {{to the rest of}} the Siphonaptera.|$|E

Therefore what was a short syllable in Greek (i.e. positions 3 and 5) is more often than not long in Latin, but less likely to <b>be</b> <b>long</b> than what <b>was</b> an anceps in the Greek line.|$|R

5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time <b>was</b> <b>long,</b> taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|In this aspect, it {{resembled the}} stegosaurids, which also bore {{primitive}} teeth and simple jaws. Its diet would have consisted of ferns or conifers, as grasses did not evolve until {{late into the}} Cretaceous Period, after Scelidosaurus <b>was</b> <b>long</b> extinct.|$|E

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study {{found no evidence}} for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{believed}} to be a subspecies of the European red deer (Cervus elaphus), but evidence from a number of mitochondrial DNA genetic studies beginning in 1998 show that the two are distinct species. Key morphological differences that distinguish C. canadensis from C. elaphus are the former's wider rump patch and paler-hued antlers.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material <b>was</b> <b>long</b> ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E
5|$|Muscarine, {{discovered}} in 1869, <b>was</b> <b>long</b> {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A.muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A.muscaria is too low {{to play a role in}} the symptoms of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|One dodo was {{reportedly}} sent {{as far as}} Nagasaki, Japan in 1647, but it <b>was</b> <b>long</b> unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.|$|E
5000|$|The Don usually stands , {{and may be}} bay, black, gray or chestnut.

The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs.
