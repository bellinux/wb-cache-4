5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scorpio {{has managed}} to capture a secret agent named Mr. Bont. Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying {{that he has been}} doing a great job {{for the first time in}} his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.|$|E

But Pro-Communist POW experienced torture, cutting out limbs, or executed in public. Being forced to write confession letters and tattoo of Anti-Communism slogan, and Flag of the Republic of China are also commonly seen, in case any <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to mainland China.|$|E

5000|$|According to Attila, {{the band}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make an album that [...] "sounded like Mayhem." [...] He said that [...] "After the Ordo album, {{which was a}} little bit progressive—maybe a little bit too much—almost like a fusion album where riffs were not {{repeated}} and the rhythm was always out or different or kind of twisted, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> from there instead of going forward in that direction. Every Mayhem album has a kind of unique aspect, but we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a little bit more traditional extreme metal. Of course, there’s all these elements that Mayhem has built up for itself as a band, but we still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> something that was straightforward musically and a little more brutal and more like extreme metal." ...|$|R

25|$|When Titanic sank at 2:20a.m., Boxhall {{suggested}} to the occupants {{that they should}} go back to pick people up from the water. However, they refused outright. Boxhall found this puzzling, as only a short time before the women had pleaded with Smith for their husbands to be allowed to accompany them, yet now they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to save them (although actually only one woman, Mrs. Walter Douglas, had left a husband on board). The boat was the first to reach Carpathia, at 4:10a.m.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{return of}} {{refugees}} into {{their country of}} origin, in safety and dignity, is based on their free will and their informed decision. In {{the last couple of}} years parts of or even whole refugee populations were able to return to their home countries: e.g. 120,000 Congolese refugees returned from the Republic of Congo to the DRC, 30,000 Angolans returned home from the DRC and Botswana, Ivorian refugees returned from Liberia, Afghans from Pakistan, and Iraqis from Syria. In 2013, the governments of Kenya and Somalia also signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of refugees from Somalia. The UNHCR and the IOM offer assistance to refugees who want to return voluntarily to their home countries. Many developed countries also have Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes for asylum seekers who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> or were refused asylum.|$|E

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to another six months of indecision and hurt. I'm shocked that the other actors re-signed. ... The brilliance of the show under Levinson was lost this season. It's like watching {{the sinking of the}} Titanic. The problem is that the iceberg is the guys who built the ship [...] the producers. You can never trust producers. They would have said to van Gogh: 'Nice painting. A little lighter on the colors and we can sell it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{playing some}} of the songs on which she had been working, Dr. Dre told her, [...] "You don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there." [...] Instead of {{using one of the}} tracks, Dr. Dre instead {{suggested}} using English reggae duo Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1993 song [...] "Rich Girl", which itself interpolated [...] "If I Were a Rich Man" [...] from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. Stefani and Eve helped each other with their parts, but when they presented Dr. Dre with the demo, he told them to rewrite the song, suggesting that Stefani play a character in the song.|$|E

[...] Sean Garrett compared {{the sound of the}} new tracks with her previous hit singles [...] "Umbrella" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy". In an interview for MTV UK, the vice president of Def Jam Recordings compared the upcoming Rihanna album with Michael Jackson's Thriller saying, [...] "Rihanna is coming along incredibly. I’m trying to push her to where every song will be a hit from one to 12. I’m talking about NO album fillers. Our bar for this album is Michael Jackson's ‘Thriller’." ...|$|E

500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later. [...] "The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) drives {{all the way}} to Florida, {{without telling}} anyone, to try and woo back Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), where she has been living with the elderly Irene (Georgia Engel) and her middle-aged Grandson, Glenn (Brad Morris), as a live-in maid. He surprises Erin by popping out of a {{delivery}} box and singing [...] "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours", but she is not particularly excited to see him, and states she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Scranton with him. The situation is further complicated when Andy reveals to Erin that he has not yet broken up with his current girlfriend, Jessica. Andy tells Erin he loves her, but she rejects him; Andy subsequently leaves, his feelings crushed. Irene, who had been treating Andy with disdain over the way Erin spoke of him, sees that he is a nice person and encourages Erin to go back with him. She runs up to him as he is leaving in his car and they share a kiss before heading back to Scranton.|$|E

500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are behind you, and you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|Within a year, burning leaving resistants that didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in plantations, Ernouf had {{restored}} slave {{order and}} agricultural production. From his base on Guadeloupe, he dealt largely {{with many of}} the refugee planters who escaped the previous years' carnage. He also mastered the Swedish island of St. Barts, where the rebels of St. Domingo had taken refuge, and from which they coordinated privateering against British and American shipping. In all, he confiscated 134vessels, and proceeds from their sale amounted to 80million francs. There is some evidence to suggest that he either actively encouraged, or at least permitted, the earlier practice of privateering against British and American shipping; British officers later found open commissions, signed by Ernouf, which suggested he was granting commissions to pirates for [...] "services" [...] rendered. Four privateer ships sailing from Guadeloupe between 1805 and 1810 bore the name Général Ernouf, one of which was the captured sloop-of-war HMS Lilly), which underscores his encouragement of privateering. His task was further complicated by the failure of the Treaty of Amiens and the outbreak of war with Britain. To protect Guadeloupe, he raised coastal batteries.|$|E

[...] Later, at a park, Liz visits Dennis, in which she sees that he is building a strange contraption. Dennis tells her that he is trying to recreate and improve on the Balloon boy incident, a reference to the October 2009 hoax in which two parents claimed their son was on board a helium balloon that had floated away, but later {{turned out to be a}} publicity stunt. At Floyd's wedding, Wesley, who is English, tells Liz that he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England, as he does not want to witness the 2012 Summer Olympics, which is scheduled to take place in London, explaining [...] "Did you see the Beijing opening ceremonies? We don't have control over our people like that." [...] The episode's title is a reference to the Emmanuelle series of erotic films.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
