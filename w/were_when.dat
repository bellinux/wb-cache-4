5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two <b>were</b> <b>when</b> the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E

An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> very few people can agree. High distinctiveness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models <b>were</b> <b>when</b> {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E
5|$|When Malmö FF {{was founded}} in 1910, there was no {{established}} official league system in Swedish football. The club therefore competed in two cup competitions: the nationally-organised Svenska Mästerskapet, and Distriktsmästerskapet, the regional championship of Scania. The team's best performances during these early years <b>were</b> <b>when</b> they reached the Svenska Mästerskapet quarter-finals in 1920, and the Distriktsmästerskapet final twice, in 1916 and 1918. The club {{would go on to}} win Distriktsmästerskapet 27 times before the competition was abolished in 1966.|$|E
5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they <b>were</b> <b>when</b> Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{came back}} from a 17-point deficit to defeat Notre Dame 35–31, scoring the winning {{touchdown}} with two seconds remaining. Notre Dame started the scoring with two consecutive touchdowns in the first quarter, with the first coming from a seven-yard catch by Theo Riddick, and the second from a four-yard run by Cierre Wood. Michigan's only points of the first half came on a 43-yard reception by Junior Hemingway in the second quarter. Notre Dame answered with a 38-yard field goal by David Ruffer just before halftime to extend its lead to ten points. The score at halftime was 17–7 in favor of Notre Dame. The only points of the third quarter <b>were</b> <b>when</b> Notre Dame's T. J. Jones caught a 15-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter Michigan rallied from behind, scoring three consecutive touchdowns: first a one-yard run by Denard Robinson after Stephen Hopkins fumbled at the goal line, then a 47-yard catch by Jeremy Gallon, then a 21-yard catch by Vincent Smith to give them their first lead of the game. Notre Dame responded almost immediately, as Theo Riddick scored his second touchdown of the game less than a minute later on a 29-yard catch. Michigan received the ball on its 20-yard line with 30 seconds remaining, and drove 80 yards in 28 seconds with Roy Roundtree scoring the game-winning touchdown with two seconds left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Section 201 amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously <b>were</b> <b>when</b> {{it was the}} San Francisco Mint) {{until such time as}} the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins {{to meet the needs of}} the nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the Gold Standard Act of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and restrike them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage.|$|E
5|$|Stewart, Harvick and Edwards led at the lap 57 restart. Two laps later, Earnhardt and Edwards {{temporarily}} {{moved to}} the front of the field but Stewart retook the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, McMurray drove down from the top lane after exiting turn two, and went into Almirola in the middle lane, causing Almirola to make contact with Danica Patrick on the backstraightaway, sending her car spinning 180 degrees, and straight into the inside wall which she hit with her right-hand side, sustaining heavy damage to her car. The crash caused the third and final caution of the race to be shown. Patrick was unhurt; she was able to walk to an ambulance that took her to the in-field medical center. The field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers <b>were</b> <b>when</b> the caution began. This gave Stewart the victory; Earnhardt finished second, and Ambrose finished third. Burton and Edwards completed the top five finishers. McDowell and Robby Gordon earned transfers to qualify for the Daytona 500. The first race had a total of three cautions and eight lead changes among five different drivers. Hamlin's total of 27 laps led was the most of any competitor. Stewart led three times for a total of 21 laps.|$|E

5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers <b>were</b> <b>when</b> the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E
