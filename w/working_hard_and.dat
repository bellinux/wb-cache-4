500|$|Solid feeds {{are placed}} into three categories: [...] forages (such as hay and grass), {{concentrates}} (including grain or pelleted rations), and supplements (such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets). [...] Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% {{or more of}} the animal's diet by weight should be forages. [...] If a horse is <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> requires more energy, the use of grain is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing. [...] However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day.|$|E

[...] Heyward attended Henry County High School in McDonough near Atlanta. [...] Heyward briefly played basketball in his youth, but concentrated exclusively on baseball in high school after his father's urging.

And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarmiento {{was born}} in Carrascal, a poor suburb of San Juan, Argentina on February 15, 1811. His father, José Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, {{had served in the}} {{military}} during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan. His mother, Doña Paula Zoila de Albarracín e Irrázabal, was a very pious woman, who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself. As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On September 21, 1801, José and Paula were married. They had 15children, 9 of whom died; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood. Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was always <b>working</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in.

500|$|Knowledge of Twyne's {{private life}} {{is derived from}} his frugal habit of reusing blank sides of letters that he {{received}} for making notes upon: in this way, some letters to and from his father between 1596 and 1613 have survived. As a student, Twyne wrote assuring his father that he was <b>working</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> asking for [...] "money, clothes, books and cheese". He complained that his allowance {{was not enough to}} employ someone to carry out tasks such as making the fire, but his father was unsympathetic. He also is shown to be a keen lute player. Later, his father raised the issue of marriage, and Twyne was anxious to put forward reasons why his father's suggestion came at the wrong time, because of (for example) his lack of an income. His father's death in 1613 not only freed him from parental pressure to marry, but also (as the only surviving son) led to his inheriting his father's estate; he remained single {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2010 AFL season, Selwood was {{retained}} as {{the youngest}} member of the club's revamped leadership group. Despite being unable to defend their NAB Cup title over the pre-season, Geelong re-signed Selwood to a new two-year contract with the club. Selwood highlighted his desire to [...] "give a little bit back (to Geelong) by <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> working through the next era of Geelong football". During the home and away campaign, Selwood set various personal milestones: in a round six fixture against Richmond, Selwood made a career–high 29handpasses—also the third–highest recorded in AFL history—while in a round nineteen match against Collingwood he gathered a career–high 20contested possessions. In total, Selwood made 24appearances during the season to help the club achieve a 17–5 record and qualify for the finals series in second position on the ladder. Geelong faced a 2009 Grand Final rematch against St Kilda {{during the first week of}} the finals series, and were defeated in a qualifying final for the first time in four years. Selwood was restricted to just four disposals in the first half of the qualifying final loss, his lowest return in a half of football since his debut match in 2007. The following week, he responded with a 33disposal semi–final performance—including a game–high 12contested possessions and career–high 11clearances—to help Geelong defeat Fremantle and progress to the preliminary final for the fourth consecutive season. However, Geelong's defeat to Collingwood subsequently denied them a fourth successive appearance in the Grand Final, and marked Selwood's absence from a Grand Final for the first time in his career to date.|$|E

However, higher uncertainty makes analysts’ tasks harder so it is unclear if analyst output is more valuable in bad times.
