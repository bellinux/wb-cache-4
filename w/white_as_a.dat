5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from {{his work at the}} Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that he might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted <b>White</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E

25|$|At a {{time when}} the women's {{suffrage}} movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor Pathé Frères released an adventure film serial titled The Perils of Pauline.

25|$|For years, the {{original}} colours of Beşiktaş {{were believed to}} be Red and White; and then temporarily changed into Black and <b>White</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of mourning for the dead in Balkan Wars, which included some players of the club.

25|$|Francis Day and his {{superior}} Andrew Cogan {{can be considered}} as the founders of Madras (now Chennai). They began construction of the Fort St George on 23 April 1640 and houses for their residence. Their small fortified settlement quickly attracted other East Indian traders and as the Dutch position collapsed under hostile Indian power they also slowly joined the settlement. By the 1646, the settlement had reached 19,000 persons and with the Portuguese and Dutch populations at their forts substantially more. To further consolidate their position, the Company combined the various settlements around an expanded Fort St. George, which including its citadel also included a larger outside area surrounded by an additional wall. This area became the Fort St. George settlement. As stipulated by the Treaty signed with the Nayak, the British and other Christian Europeans were not allowed to decorate the outside of their buildings in any other color but <b>white.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, over time, the area {{came to be known as}} 'White Town'.|$|E
25|$|From {{the years}} 1500 to 1850, an {{estimated}} 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil; the territory received {{the highest number}} of slaves of any country in the Americas. Scholars estimate {{that more than half of}} the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (pardo) often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted as <b>white.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)— a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.|$|E

[...] Shortly after his induction into the band, White began to express dissatisfaction with drummer Kevin Kelley and soon persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace him with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), who White had previously played with in the country rock band Nashville West.|$|E

The procession was led by Lennon, dressed in <b>white,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> religious figure, Starr, dressed in black, as the undertaker, McCartney, {{out of step with the}} others, as a barefoot corpse and Harrison, dressed in denim, as the gravedigger.

500|$|There are 66 {{letters to}} the lawyer Daines Barrington [...] (1727–1800), occupying half the book. Letter 1, on summer birds of passage, is dated 30 June 1769; Letter 66, on thunderstorms, is dated 25 June 1787. The Barrington letters {{therefore}} largely overlap the time frame of those to Pennant, but began and ended somewhat later. It was Barrington who suggested to White that he should write a book from his observations; although Pennant had been corresponding with White for a while, he was relying on White for natural history information for his own books, and, suggests White's biographer Richard Mabey, must have wanted <b>White</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuing source of information, not as a rival author. Barrington, on the other hand, liked to theorize about the natural world, but {{had little interest in}} making observations himself, and tended to accept claimed facts uncritically.|$|E

500|$|Social {{historian}} Brian Carso notes that, as the 19th century progressed, {{the story}} of Arnold's betrayal was portrayed with near-mythical proportions {{as a part of}} the national creation story. It was invoked again as sectional conflicts increased in the years before the American Civil War. Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington, pointing out that the unity of New England and the southern states which led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point. Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold, implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason. Harper's Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as [...] "a few men directing this colossal treason, by whose side Benedict Arnold shines <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> saint." ...|$|E

[...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert <b>White</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{usage of}} zinc oxide (zinc white) was in paints {{and as an}} {{additive}} to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 {{but it did not}} mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so [...] "clean" [...] it is valuable for making tints with other colors, but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ground for their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years.|$|E
