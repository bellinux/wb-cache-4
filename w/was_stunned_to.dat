Trott {{had turned his}} back and leapt {{out of the way}} of the ball; he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> find the ball lodged in his right pocket. He became Sussex captain on 31 July 2012, succeeding Michael Yardy.|$|E

Liz was, as usual, the town busybody, while Russ <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> learn he {{was the father of}} Sharlene's daughter, Josie Watts (Alexandra Wilson), and Olivia pursued a dancing career.|$|E
25|$|Led by Tarkenton {{and running}} back Chuck Foreman, the 1975 Vikings {{got off to a}} 10–0 start and easily won another {{division}} title. However, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the , 17–14, on a controversial touchdown pass from the Cowboys' quarterback Roger Staubach to wide receiver Drew Pearson that became known as the Hail Mary. The touchdown was controversial because many felt that Pearson pushed off on Vikings defensive back Nate Wright, which is pass interference and a violation of the rules. As the Metropolitan Stadium crowd <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> learn that no penalty was called, debris was thrown on the field for several minutes. A Corby's Whiskey bottle struck game official, Armen Terzian, rendering him unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Tomašević {{was buried}} {{on a hill}} near Jajce. Europe <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> see the Bosnian state fall almost {{completely}} within weeks of his death. The country's quick submission {{is said to be}} the consequence of a poor cooperation between Stephen and his noblemen, but it is perhaps most accurate to attribute it to the people's low morale and general belief that the conquest was inevitable. [...] Additionally, the religiously diverse Bosnians were aware, much like the neighbouring Serbians, that the country would be overrun by Hungary if not by the Ottomans, and that they would enjoy far less freedom of religion and far higher taxes in that case. Therefore, resistance was not as strong as it could have been. Pope Pius's claim that adherents of the Bosnian Church betrayed the kingdom is groundless.|$|E
500|$|Her books shaped lesbian {{identity}} for lesbians and heterosexuals alike, but Bannon was mostly unaware of their impact. She stopped writing in 1962. Later, {{she earned a}} doctorate in linguistics and became an academic. She endured a difficult marriage for 27years and, as she separated from {{her husband in the}} 1980s, her books were republished; she <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> learn of their influence on society. They were released again between 2001 and 2003 and were adapted as an award-winning Off-Broadway production. They are taught in Women's and LGBT studies courses, and Bannon has received numerous awards for pioneering lesbian and gay literature. She has been described as [...] "the premier fictional representation of US lesbian life in the fifties and sixties", and {{it has been said that}} her books [...] "rest on the bookshelf of nearly every even faintly literate Lesbian".|$|E

500|$|The iOS version's {{improvements}} {{over the}} original PSP version were positively received. The website Famitsu App {{noted that the}} iOS version has shorter loading times and greater display resolution compared to the PSP version. Gay wrote that the iPhone 4's Retina Display made the game look [...] "a whole lot better than it did on the PSP or Vita", while Kumada said he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> see the iPhone 5's more vibrant colors and lack of interlacing, despite its smaller screen compared to the PSP. At the same time, reviewers had mixed opinions regarding the iOS' version's control scheme. Ryūichi Matsumoto of 4Gamer.net appreciated the iOS version's use of touch screen input, feeling that it simplified the controls and Gay felt the touch controls felt natural. In contrast, Famitsu App's writer {{felt that it was}} easier to hold down notes with the PSP's buttons, and Chuang said that playing on an iPad Mini felt less precise than on the PSP, but noted that the player can theoretically [...] "hit the notes even faster" [...] with a touch screen. Chuang also noted he occasionally opened the iOS version's pause menu by accident due to the touch controls, and Matsumoto complained that the use of touch screen input meant that his fingers would be blocking his view.|$|E
500|$|SS Wilfred Sykes loaded {{opposite}} Fitzgerald at the Burlington Northern Dock#1 {{and departed}} at 4:15p.m., {{about two hours}} after Fitzgerald. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of Sykes predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that {{took advantage of the}} protection offered by the lake's north shore {{in order to avoid the}} worst effects of the storm. The crew of Sykes followed the radio conversations between Fitzgerald and Anderson during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association downbound route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00p.m., issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior. Anderson and Fitzgerald altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00a.m. on November 10. Fitzgerald reported winds of [...] and waves [...] high. Captain Paquette of Sykes reported that after 1a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state that [...] "we're going to try for some lee from Isle Royale. You're walking away from us anyway... I can't stay with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams {{moved from}} her {{hometown}} Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, {{where she met}} brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro at a weekly supplemental program for home-schooled students. Shortly after arriving, she began taking vocal lessons with Brett Manning. Prior to forming Paramore, Williams and bassist Jeremy Davis, along with friend Kimee Read, {{took part in a}} funk cover band called The Factory, while Josh and Zac Farro had practiced together after school. The other members of what was soon to be Paramore had been [...] "edgy about the whole female thing" [...] of having Williams as vocalist, but, because they were good friends, she started writing for them. Williams said of the members when she first met them, [...] "They were the first people I met who were as passionate about music as I was." [...] The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar/backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). When Davis showed up, he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> find out the drummer was only twelve years old. He admitted [...] "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This {{is not going to work}} because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something." [...] According to Williams, the name [...] "Paramore" [...] came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players. Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone [...] "" [...] ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the Paramore spelling.|$|E

2500|$|The {{season was}} not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, [...] "I have {{something}} to say. I think Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win." [...] O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, [...] "Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that {{the way he had}} been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team." [...] Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. [...] "There was a lot of hatred in [...] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." [...] O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant {{made it a point to}} get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.|$|E
60|$|As a satire on the petrifaction mania, or {{anything}} else, my Petrified Man was a disheartening failure; for everybody received him in innocent good faith, and I <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> <b>to</b> see the creature I had begotten to pull down the wonder-business with, and bring derision upon it, calmly exalted {{to the grand}} chief place {{in the list of}} the genuine marvels our Nevada had produced. I was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of my scheme, that at first I was angry, and did not like to think about it; but by and by, when the exchanges began to come in with the Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glorified, I began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction; and as my gentleman's field of travels broadened, and by the exchanges I saw that he steadily and implacably penetrated territory after territory, state after state, and land after land, till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy in the august London Lancet, my cup was full, and I said I was glad I had done it. I think that for about eleven months, as nearly as I can remember, Mr.----'s daily mail-bag continued to be swollen by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many climes with the Petrified Man in them, marked around with a prominent belt of ink. I sent them to him. I did it for spite, not for fun.|$|E
