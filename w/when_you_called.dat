Much the best way to work him to supply that thousand dollars is to split it into parts and contribute, say a hundred dollars a year, or fifty, or whatever the sum maybe. Let him contribute ten or twenty a year. He doesn't feel that, but he does feel it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> upon him to contribute a large amount. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> get used to it you would rather contribute than borrow money.|$|R
