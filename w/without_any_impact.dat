25|$|Hurricanes pose {{a severe}} threat each {{year during the}} June 1 to November 30 {{hurricane}} season, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. From 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> in the state by at least a tropical storm.|$|E

The seismic response does not change <b>without</b> <b>any</b> significant <b>impact</b> on the rock mass and its internal structure.|$|R
50|$|IP privateering resembles an {{historic}} method of waging war so effective {{that it had}} to be abolished by treaty, the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law (1856). “Privateering,” as it was called, was effective and cheap - the privateer’s actions cost the sponsoring government nothing. Privateering, like the creation of corporations, allowed governments to pursue policy objectives <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> on the treasury. In short, classical privateering removed most obstacles to waging war, save for the opponent’s ability to retaliate. IP privateering similarly has the opponent’s ability to retaliate as its greatest obstacle, hence the importance of stealth to the sponsor.|$|E
5000|$|Mainframes {{also have}} {{execution}} integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads [...] "in flight" [...] to functioning processors, including spares, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, {{also found in}} HP's NonStop systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their [...] "steps" [...] (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.|$|E

50|$|If the {{computer}} systems in a server room are mission critical, removing single points {{of failure and}} common-mode failures may be of high importance. The level of desired redundancy is determined by factors such as whether the organisation can tolerate interruption whilst failover systems are activated, or must they be seamless <b>without</b> <b>any</b> business <b>impacts.</b> Other than computer hardware redundancy, the main consideration here is the provisioning of failover power supplies and cooling.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, National Front activist John King, the {{candidate}} for Rochester and Chatham in the 1979 election, broke from that group and formed his own minor party also {{using the name}} National Labour Party. This version, which was not connected to Bean's, took a Powellite line on immigration although it was significantly less economically neo-liberal than Powell. This group contested two elections, the 1983 Bermondsey by-election and the Ashford constituency in the 1983 general election, <b>without</b> making <b>any</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|R

50|$|The AMS-IX {{platform}} is continually evolving {{due to its}} rapid growth in traffic and number of connected member ports.

The active switching topology star is determined by means of the VSRP protocol. This topology is AMS-IX version 3.|$|E
50|$|Chalmers {{passed on}} the {{decision}} to confirm the death sentence to Brigadier General Malcolm. The only person {{who was able to}} intervene in this case was Sir Hector Van Cuylenberg, who was the elected representative in the legislature, but his representations were not taken seriously by the military. Many prominent citizens and educationists, both British and Ceylonese alike, appealed against the judgment <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>impact.</b> An appeal was made to King George V. On 7 July 1915, Pedris was stripped of his rank and executed by firing squad. His body was buried in an unmarked grave, in keeping with military tradition but against the wishes of his family. However, D. D. Pedris had people spy on the transport and burial of the body, and the British had actually chosen a cemetery where the Pedris family owned several plots. One of those plots was chosen for the interment, and only one or two members of the Pedris family knew the exact location. In 1987, Pedris’s grave was unearthed, and the remains were verified as his and reburied with military honors.|$|E

We therefore propose a simple modification to the work-stealing algorithm that significantly improves its performance on scatter-gather workloads, <b>without</b> <b>any</b> negative <b>impact</b> on other types of workloads. 1...|$|R
5000|$|A {{publisher}} in a pub/sub system may {{assume that a}} subscriber is listening, when {{in fact it is}} not. A factory may utilize a pub/sub system where equipment can publish problems or failures to a subscriber that displays and logs those problems. If the logger fails (crashes), equipment problem publishers won't necessarily receive notice of the logger failure, and error messages will not be displayed or recorded by any equipment on the pub/sub system. It should be noted that this is also a design challenge for alternative messaging architectures, such as a client/server system. In a client/server system, when an error logger fails, the system will receive an indication of the error logger (server) failure. However, the client/server system {{will have to deal with}} that failure by having redundant logging servers online, or by dynamically spawning fallback logging servers. This adds complexity to the client and server designs, as well as to the client/server architecture as a whole. However, in a pub/sub system, redundant logging subscribers that are exact duplicates of the existing logger can be added to the system to increase logging reliability <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>impact</b> to any other equipment on the system. In a pub/sub system, the feature of assured error message logging can be added incrementally, subsequent to implementing the basic functionality of equipment problem message logging.|$|E
