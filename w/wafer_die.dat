Face-to-face silicon (Si) dies stacking is one of the three dimensional (3 D) packaging technologies to form a high density module. In this work, a chip level stacked module was demonstrated for medical application and assessed its package level reliability. The chip level stack module is achieved by stacking two thin dies of different size and thickness together using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects. Electrical simulations are carried out to obtain RLC parameters of micro bump interconnect and complete interconnection from daughter die to substrate. Mechanical simulations are also carried out to study the stress analysis on micro bumps and CSP bumps in the package and parametric study of stacked module package to study the effect of substrate material, underfill material die thicknesses on package reliability and warpage. Test chips are designed and fabricated with daisy chain test structures to access the reliability of the stack module.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{important}} to predict yield in semiconductor test process {{in order to increase}} yield. In this study, yield prediction means finding out defective <b>die,</b> <b>wafer</b> or lot effectively. Semiconductor test process consists of some test steps and each test includes various test items. In other world, test data has a big and complicated characteristic. It also is disproportionably distributed as the number of data belonging to FAIL class is extremely low. For yield prediction, general data mining techniques have a limitation without any data pre-processing due to eigen properties of test data. Therefore, this study proposes an under-sampling method using support vector machine (SVM) to eliminate an imbalanced characteristic. For evaluating a performance, randomly under-sampling method is compared with the proposed method using actual semiconductor test data. As a result, sampling method using SVM is effective in generating robust model for yield prediction...|$|R
