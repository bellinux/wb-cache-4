30|$|The slight {{difference}} {{in the number of}} plants among treatment units might be due to health conditions of the individual plants that may affect plant multiplication. Sometimes, <b>wilting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoots</b> was also noticed which might be due to variations of responses of individual plant to high level of organic and/or nutrient loading of the influent that can cause stress to the plants (Bindu et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} survey of olive groves in the Canosa di Puglia, Cerignola and Foggia areas of {{southern}} Italy a decline of olive trees was observed. The symptoms consisted of a generalised decline of the trees beginning with foliar discolouration and leaf drop, <b>wilting</b> <b>of</b> apical <b>shoots,</b> die-back <b>of</b> twigs and branches, and brown streaking under the bark of the trunk, branches and twigs. At later stages of the disease necrosis and cankers were observed on the bark. The symptoms were similar to those caused by Verticillium wilt, but morphological and molecular analyses demonstrated that the fungal agent responsible was Pleurostomophora richardsiae. Pathogenicity tests carried out on young shoots showed rapid infection by P. richardsiae following artificial inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. richardsiae as the causal agent of brown streaking under the bark of olive trees, and <b>of</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> twigs and leaves. It is not clear if this fungus moves through the phloem or xylem, but {{on the basis of the}} sub-cortical symptoms, it appears that it moves through the phloem...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{fresh water}} is a global problem that {{adversely}} affects crops, including young apple (Malus × domestica) trees. Innovative technologies {{will be needed to}} ensure tree survival and productivity. Recently, selected chemicals have been used to prepare plants for avoidance and recovery from water stress by a process termed priming. Two priming compounds, abscisic acid (ABA) and DL- β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) have been shown to confer plant protection against a range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Our objective was to determine the resistance to and recovery from dehydration of apple seedlings treated with s-ABA and BABA. Three greenhouse experiments were conducted in which combinations of s-ABA and BABA were applied as a root drench to one-year-old ‘Royal Gala’ apple trees and responses to dehydration were evaluated. Changes in leaf water potential (ψw), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), leaf ABA and growth were measured during dehydration and rehydration. In two experiments, pretreatment with BABA reduced early morning E but BABA was not as effective as s-ABA in delaying dehydration-induced <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> tips. In another experiment during the second week without water both BABA- and s-ABA-treated trees had 42 to 62 % higher leaf ψw, respectively, and 45 % lower leaf ABA than unwatered controls. Higher leaf ψw was not consistently associated with reduced gs and E suggesting that mechanisms other than increased stomatal resistance may provide drought resistance. Compared with control trees, there was nearly 80 % more shoot growth following rewatering after dehydration in trees that were primed with BABA and s-ABA (1. 0 mM each). Leaf senescence was more evident in s-ABA- than BABA-treated trees and, although growth resumed after dehydration, the amount of growth varied with concentration of the priming treatments. Both individual compounds provided dehydration protection to young apple trees but in combination they were not clearly superior to either compound alone...|$|R

Inoculum density of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Sacc.) was two 14 mm- diameter disks per planting hole taken from 10 day old cultures growing on PDA. Plant performance was based on shoot height and weight; stem diameter; number and weight of tomato fruits.

40|$|Presented {{review of}} rose diseases, {{associated}} with the plant degeneration symptoms, includes rose streak, rose colour break, rose rosette or rose witches' broom, rose dieback, rose wilt, rose stunt, rose leaf curl, rose spring dwarf, rose little leaf, rose "frisure", rose bud proliferation and rose flower proliferation. Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial <b>wilt</b> and dieback <b>of</b> <b>shoots.</b> Proliferation and epinasty often occurred. Apart from detected viruses (TSV. SLRSV) parts of degeneration syndrome have been transmitted by grafting other have failed to achieve any transmission of the causal agent.

40|$|Plant tagging using {{radiofrequency}} identification (RFID) microchips {{is attractive}} for ornamental shrubs, such as rose (Rosa spp.), {{due to their}} high market value, wide distribution, health certification system, and numerous uses. Differently from other woody species for which methods of microchip implantation have been tested, rose tagging requires the possibility of insertion within canes of less than 10 mm diameter, such as those typically found in the rose nursery setting. Moreover, the possibility of tagging after grafting without changing common plant production procedures and aesthetic value are important considerations. Toward this aim, a new method of microchip insertion was developed. To test its effects on roses, two cultivars were subjected to a tagging procedure, and histological observations of tissues around the microchip and growth analysis of plant canes were performed. Microchip implantation did not cause xylem necrosis in 8 - to 9 -mm-diameter canes, but in lower diameter canes <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> the lateral <b>shoot</b> and detriments in growth were observed compared with control plants. The tagged roses were tracked by a database developed for rose information, field log, and botanical sheet retrieval. Our findings suggest that rose plants can be safely tagged with a RFID microchip following suitable selection of cane calliper {{as early as the}} nursery phase without negative effects on plant appearance...|$|R
