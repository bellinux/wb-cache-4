40|$|Conifers have complex defense {{responses}} to initial attacks by insects and pathogens {{that can have}} cascading effects on success of subsequent colonizers. However, drought can affect a plant's {{ability to respond to}} biotic agents by potentially altering the resources needed for the energetically costly production of induced defense chemicals. We investigated the impact of reduced water on induced chemical defenses of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) seedlings from initial attack by biotic agents and resistance to subsequent challenge inoculation with a pathogenic fungal associate of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), Grosmannia clavigera. Applications of phytohormones (methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate) and G. clavigera were used for initial induction of defenses. Monoterpene concentrations varied with initial induction from fungal and phytohormone application while <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> had no effect. Seedlings treated with G. clavigera and methyl jasmonate had the greatest monoterpene concentrations compared to the control and methyl salicylate-treated seedlings. However, the monoterpene response to the challenge inoculation varied with <b>watering</b> <b>treatments,</b> not with prior induction treatments, with lower monoterpene concentrations in fungal lesions on seedlings in the low to moderate <b>watering</b> <b>treatments</b> compared to normal <b>watering</b> <b>treatment.</b> Furthermore, prior induction from phytohormones resulted in systemic cross-induction of resistance to G. clavigera under normal <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> but susceptibility under low <b>watering</b> <b>treatment.</b> Seedlings stressed by low water conditions, which also had lower stomatal conductance than seedlings in the normal <b>watering</b> <b>treatment,</b> likely allocated resources to initial defense response but were left unable to acquire further resources for subsequent responses. Our results demonstrate that drought can affect interactions among tree-infesting organisms through systemic cross-induction of susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} found {{positive}} relationships between plant diversity and arthropod communities, but {{the interactive effects of}} plant genetic diversity and environmental stress on arthropods are not well documented. In this study, we investigated the consequences of plant genotypic diversity, <b>watering</b> <b>treatment,</b> and its interaction for the ground-dwelling arthropod community in an experimental common garden of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We found that varying plant genotypic diversity and <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> altered multivariate arthropod community composition and structure. Arthropod biodiversity and richness showed a distinct response to the plant diversity × <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> interaction, declining sharply in water-limited genotypic mixtures. Abundance of arthropod functional groups did not show any response to diversity or the plant diversity × <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> interaction, but varied in their response to <b>watering</b> <b>treatment,</b> with predator and detritivore abundance increasing and parasitoid abundance decreasing in well-watered blocks. Our results conflict with most previous studies, and suggest that environmental stress can substantially change the nature of the plant-arthropod diversity relationship. Additionally, we suggest that the plant-arthropod diversity relationship is dependent on the type of plant and arthropod species sampled, and that the association between tree diversity and ground-dwelling arthropods may be much different than more commonly studied grassland species and herbivorous arthropods...|$|R

40|$|Genotypic {{diversity}} within populations can have important evolutionary consequences, but the ecological effects of intraspecific genetic variation on community and ecosystem function {{have only been}} studied in a few systems. I present {{the results of a}} three-year study designed to address the ecological impacts of genotypic diversity in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), using aspen genotypes planted across genotypic diversity levels (monoculture and mixture) and <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> levels (well-watered and water-limited). First, I demonstrated that significant variation exists among genotypes {{for a wide range of}} growth, morphological and physiological traits, and quantified high heritability and coefficient of genetic variation values for those traits. This demonstrates that heritable phenotypic variation exists within an aspen population, which could potentially have community and ecosystem implications. Secondly, I collected ground-dwelling arthropods across experimental treatment levels to determine if there are any community-level implications of genotypic diversity and <b>watering</b> <b>treatment.</b> Ground-dwelling arthropods were significantly affected by the genotypic diversity × <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> interaction, such that arthropod taxonomic diversity was lowest in water-limited genotypic mixtures. This result runs counter to the bulk of the plant diversity-arthropod diversity literature, which predicts that plant and arthropod diversity should be positively correlated, and highlights the importance of environmental conditions in mediating the plant-arthropod diversity relationship. Lastly, I show that there are no overall effects of genotypic diversity or <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> on tree growth patterns. Instead, there are high levels of variation among genotypes in their responses to treatments (significant genotype × diversity × <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> interactions), which are often opposing in direction. I also show that there are significant collection site × diversity × <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> interactions, demonstrating that genotypes vary in their response to experimental treatments based in part on their original collection site conditions in the field. This study demonstrates that aspen populations contain high levels of genotypic diversity, but that the ecological effects of genotypic diversity are mediated by the environment (in this case, <b>watering</b> <b>treatment)</b> and can be considerably more complicated than found in most previous studies...|$|R

5|$|For over {{a century}} the water was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality.

40|$|The lerp-forming psyllid, Creiis lituratus Froggatt, is {{the most}} {{damaging}} pest of Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden plantations growing in north-eastern New South Wales. During the past 10 years {{there have been numerous}} reports that stands of E. dunnii planted on low-lying areas that were prone to waterlogging were also prone to infestation by C. lituratus. The objective of this shadehouse study was to determine whether C. lituratus prefers young E. dunnii exposed to intermittent waterlogging compared with other <b>treatments</b> (drought, normal <b>watering</b> and a control using normal watering plus an insecticide). Also we assessed whether the nutritional status of E. dunnii foliage, in particular amino acid content, differed between <b>watering</b> <b>treatments.</b> Field-collected C. lituratus adults were released into the shadehouse three months after establishing the <b>watering</b> <b>treatments</b> to individually-potted E. dunnii arranged in a 14 × 6 randomised design. Three months after release of the psyllids, we counted significantly more eggs and nymphs present on the plants subjected to intermittent waterlogging compared with the other treatments. Applying general linear modelling (GLM) and Akaike 2 ̆ 7 s information criterion (AIC) we found that the best model included both <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> and plant structure (through height and diameter), with psyllid infestation (eggs + nymphs) significantly higher on the waterlogged plants and significantly lower in the drought treatment compared with the normal <b>watering</b> <b>treatment.</b> The application of the generalised estimating equations technique to foliar content of individual amino acids and nutrients did not reveal a clear association with <b>watering</b> <b>treatment</b> or psyllid infestation. Most of the significant differences in amino acid content between treatments were between plants watered normally but with or without the systemic insecticide imidacloprid applied as a soil drench. No eggs or nymphal stages were recorded on the plants treated with imidacloprid. This trial demonstrated that the psyllid C. lituratus has a preference for young E. dunnii subjected to periodic waterlogging.
