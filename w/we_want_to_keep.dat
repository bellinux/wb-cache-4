It included no dialogue, portraying comedy through gestures and actions, and was well received by critics and audiences. Chopra's character was kept under wraps in the trailers as the makers were not willing to reveal much about her character to increase curiosity among the audiences and was only revealed around the release {{of the film}}. Shikha Kapur, the executive director (marketing) of UTV explained [...] "Priyanka plays a very special character in Barfi, so <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her mystery intact.

[...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has {{told us that he}} is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous." [...] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: [...] "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is {{the same as it was}} on my first day when I signed." ...|$|E
500|$|According to postwar testimonies, when {{transports}} were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote {{lyrics to}} a song meant {{to celebrate the}} Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned {{to work in the}} Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: [...] "We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurray!" ...|$|E

It’s probably contrary to what most people would do, but we feel it’s real important for people to have something like this.|$|R
500|$|On 24 July 2011, Hooper had {{a penalty}} saved by Graham Stack in Celtic's first match of the 2011–12 season, a 2–0 win over Hibs. On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their enquiries about his availability. Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top player. I have no doubt one day he could play at the very top level but <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him here as long as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|Arkham Asylum and Arkham City {{composer}} Nick Arundel {{returned to}} score Arkham Knight, while his partner on those games, Ron Fish, {{was replaced by}} composer David Buckley. On his continued involvement in the series, Arundel said [...] "One {{of the good things}} about doing a sequel, is you get the opportunity to redo , to revisit things... We have a set of material that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> consistent, like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [...] theme and tailor it more to the story for this game. How can we get the Scarecrow element out of that one theme." [...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel. Singer and record producer Trent Reznor served as a music consultant on Arkham Knights [...] "Be the Batman" [...] trailer.|$|E

50|$|We {{were working}} on Live! Bootleg!, an album of old shows that <b>we</b> {{intentionally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sound bootlegged. A couple of those tracks were recorded off air onto a cassette. It had hiss all over it. We left on the hiss because the hiss was real. But I'm not sure Columbia ever understood our concept. They wanted a clean sound, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it real. That's the thrill of a real bootleg.|$|R
5000|$|According to Jon Shafer, [...] "With the {{policies}} system, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the feel of}} mixing and matching to construct one's government {{that was part of}} Civ IV, but <b>we</b> also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> instill a sense of forward momentum. Rather than having to switch out of one policy to adopt another, the player builds upon {{the policies}} already unlocked. The thought process <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> promote is 'What cool new effect do I want?' rather than the feeling of needing to perform detailed analysis to determine if switching is a good idea." ...|$|R
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{only two}} weeks {{remaining}} before the primary, a Quinnipiac University poll released May 4 showed Specter's lead against Sestak had significantly narrowed, dropping from 53-32 percent in the previous month to 47-39 percent. A daily tracking poll by Muhlenberg College showed the race as even closer, with Specter supported by 46 percent of likely voters surveyed, and Sestak trailing only four points at 42 percent. The Quinnipiac poll indicated the strongest factor in these changes was that Sestak was gaining better name recognition due to his television commercials. According to the poll, 43 percent of respondents now had a favorable view of him, compared to only 33 percent in March. The day after the poll was released, Sestak unveiled a new television advertisement strongly critical of Specter, highlighting the incumbent Senator's Republican history and showing images of him with George W. Bush and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The commercial featured a clip of Specter saying, [...] "My change in party will enable me to be reelected" [...] and ended with a narrator saying, [...] "Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job: his, not yours." [...] The same week the advertisement ran, T.J. Rooney {{said in an interview}} with Politico that a Sestak primary victory would be [...] "cataclysmic" [...] for the party in the general election, and warned Democratic voters, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this seat in Democratic hands, the only person capable of delivering that victory is Arlen Specter." ...|$|E
5000|$|As part {{of their}} equal {{protection}} claim, the plaintiffs argued that the court should evaluate distinctions based on sexual orientation using the heightened scrutiny standard. They did not assert a fundamental right to marry nor a due process claim, but focused on the equal protection claim and Nevada's disparate treatment of same-sex couples, being [...] "so convinced that our equal protection claim is correct that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the focus of the}} case there....

30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the time it takes}} for the cloud infrastructure to provision an instance, configuration scripts that need to run also determine the time it takes for the instance to become available. To some extent, this time can be reduced by installing frequently required packages in the instance image used. For example, in the case of ELVIRA we installed OpenJDK in the instance image as well as the Swarm client.jar file to avoid having to download them every time an instance is created. The Portland Group Fortran libraries, in contrast, are staged in each time an instance is created since <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the instance image generic.|$|R

5000|$|Gouldman {{admitted}} {{the album was}} [...] "almost like two-halves of an album", largely {{a result of the}} fact that he and Stewart began recording in separate countries. [...] "Vaguely, we intended starting off these tracks and then bring them together, finish them together, which a lot of people do," [...] he said. [...] "But it never happened, we got so into what we were doing, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it pure.

If we ever felt like we were losing too many cast members, we needed to end it on a high.

2500|$|In the 1952 Madras elections, the Indian National Congress {{was reduced}} to a {{minority}} in the state assembly with a coalition led by the Communist Party of India winning most of the seats. Though he did not participate, Madras governor Sri Prakasa appointed Rajagopalachari Chief Minister after nominating him to the Madras Legislative Council without consulting either the Indian Prime Minister Nehru or the ministers in the Madras state cabinet. Rajagopalachari was then able to prove that he had a majority in the assembly by luring MLAs from opposition parties to join the Indian National Congress. Nehru was furious and wrote to Rajagopalachari saying [...] "the one thing we must avoid giving is the impression that we stick to office and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> others out at all costs."

2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: [...] "This is something <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E
