The pole position went to de Ferran, though {{due to the lack}} of qualifying, he was not awarded a point in the standings as was customary for pole winners. Bräck earned second position since he held a tie-breaker over Castroneves, who started third, and Andretti began the race in fourth.|$|E

Ships sent to the NEI would return to Europe after twelve years in the tropics and complete another eight years service before being scrapped.|$|E

5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} {{alternative}} but to accept the Pathet Lao program {{as the basis for}} negotiations. The Pathet Lao agreed to the new negotiating effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in Vientiane. Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, secretary general of the Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Augustus (5 June 1771– 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 {{until his}} death. He {{was the fifth}} son and eighth child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, Ernest seemed {{unlikely}} to become a monarch, but none of his four elder brothers had a legitimate son who survived infancy. The Salic Law, which barred succession to or through a female, prevailed in Hanover; therefore, when his elder brother King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the succession to the monarchy <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> primogeniture and his niece Victoria succeeded to the throne, thus ending the personal union between the British and Hanoverian crowns that had existed since 1714.|$|E
