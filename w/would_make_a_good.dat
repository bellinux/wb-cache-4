5|$|Barbera's {{desk was}} {{opposite}} that of William Hanna. The two quickly realized they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> team.

Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him to produce an unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written {{in his spare time}} while working as a clerk for Lee, Higginson & Co., a Boston investment bank. Although he doubted that the novella <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E

5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish girl <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> ballet story. His first {{idea was}} to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the visit, the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV) {{engaged in}} a promotional {{campaign}} encouraging newspapers to cover Diệm's visit and imploring them to give the South Vietnamese president favourable coverage. The AFV also drafted many of Diệm's speeches, making sure that there were analogies made between South Vietnam and various events in American history, so that he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on the American public and decision-makers. For this purpose they employed the services of the political consultancy firm Harold Oram.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E

5|$|Hanna {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two quickly realized they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> team. By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|After Darlington {{bought the}} {{railroad}} bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, {{he made his}} intentions with the five decade-old bridge clear. He took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision {{to make the most}} out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of Andrew Ketterley also closely resembles Robert Capron, a schoolmaster at Wynyard School, which Lewis attended with his brother, whom Lewis suggested during his teens <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{model for a}} villain in a future story. Ketterley resembles Capron in his age, appearance, and behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Stinnes formed OMF Aircraft {{to produce}} a FAR 23 {{certified}} version of the Stoddard-Hamilton Glastar.

25|$|On August 25, 1778, Continental Army Major Benjamin Tallmadge {{convinced}} General George Washington that Abraham Woodhull of Setauket on Long Island <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{agent to}} gather intelligence in New York City, the British Army's headquarters and {{base of operations}} during the American Revolutionary War. For a short time, Washington continued to support Tallmadge's superior Brigadier General Charles Scott as chief of intelligence. Contrary to Tallmadge, Scott favored single missions by agents, usually officers, across enemy lines.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E

25|$|He {{dedicated}} {{his next}} film, Tess (1979), {{to the memory}} of his late wife, Sharon Tate. It was Tate who first suggested he read Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which she thought <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> film; he subsequently expected her to star in it. Nearly a decade after Tate's death, he met Nastassja Kinski, a model and aspiring young actress who had already been in a number of European films. He offered her the starring role, which she accepted. Her father was Klaus Kinski, a leading German actor, who had introduced her to films.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} nursing means that nursing ethics tends {{to examine the}} ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by {{exploring}} the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care. Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the virtues that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct {{in relation to the}} person in the nurse's care. In recent times, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights and dignity of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses, such as in the latest code from the International Council of Nurses.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} an Ipsos MORI survey, polling the British public as a whole, {{released}} on 14 July indicated that 66% of those surveyed believed that the Labour party needed a new leader before the 2020 elections.

A Opinium/Observer poll on 23 July found that among those who said they backed Labour, 54% supported Corbyn against just 22% who would prefer Smith. Some 20% said they are undecided and 4% said they {{do not intend to}} vote. When voters were asked who they thought would be the best prime minister – Corbyn or Theresa May – among Labour supporters 48% said Corbyn and 22% May, among all UK voters 52% chose May and just 16% were for Corbyn.|$|E
