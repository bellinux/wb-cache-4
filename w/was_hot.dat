She believed that somebody had given him something that affected his central nervous system. She advised the aide {{to take him to the}} hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 1958, the 1959 season <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and dry and McCool's figures improved: he made 1769 runs {{at an average}} of more than 40 runs per innings and took 64 first-class wickets, more than in any other Somerset season. McCool's final season with Somerset before his retirement was 1960, and he signed off with 1,222 runs and 29 wickets.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, {{participants}} in televised batsu games are often criticized as faking their distress, because the humor lies {{only in their}} reaction to the punishment and therefore the punishment need not exist. An oft-discussed example of this <b>is</b> the <b>hot</b> water baths—the participants claim that the water <b>is</b> extremely <b>hot,</b> {{but it does not}} need to <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> for the participants to provide a funny reaction. As such, participants will often try to convince the viewers that the water <b>is</b> <b>hot</b> through various means (having an audience member stick his hand in the water, for example, or breaking character by saying that the water <b>is</b> <b>hotter</b> than it <b>was</b> during rehearsal). Generally speaking, the punishments are real rather than faked (the water <b>is</b> <b>hot,</b> the wasabi <b>is</b> spicy), but they are maintained at a level of preventing injuries.|$|R

5|$|The biggest festival yet {{was held}} in 1990; however, {{the day after the}} festival ended, {{violence}} – between the security guards and new age travellers (the so-called Battle of Yeoman's Bridge) – led to the organisers taking 1991 and 1996 off to rethink the festival. An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and dry.|$|E
5|$|The day <b>was</b> <b>hot,</b> 87°F (31°C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates {{suffered}} {{under the}} hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was {{converted}} in appearance to a Costco for shooting. On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive).|$|E

5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of {{events that led to}} Davis' capture began early in May 1865, when the 4th Michigan Cavalry was set up in an encampment of tents at Macon, Georgia. The military unit of several battalions was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin D. Pritchard. On May 7, he was given orders to join many other units searching for the Confederate president. Pritchard's troops scouted through the country along the Ocmulgee River, and by the next day the Michiganders had come to Hawkinsville, Georgia, about fifty miles south of Macon, from where they continued along the river to Abbeville, Georgia. There, Pritchard learned from Lieutenant Colonel Henry Harnden that his First Wisconsin Cavalry <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> on Davis's trail. After a meeting between the two colonels, Harnden and his men headed off towards Irwinville, some twenty miles south of their position.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead International Stadium {{has been}} used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, The Police {{performed}} at the stadium as part of their Ghost in the Machine Tour, with U2 as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed disappointed that the stadium was only half full and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 Guns N' Roses, supported by Soundgarden and Faith No More, performed at the stadium. This time the weather <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the Use Your Illusion Tour, was a sell-out. American rock group Bon Jovi have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by Skin, on their These Days Tour. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their Crush Tour. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is Tina Turner. As part of her , Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (2122 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her Wildest Dreams Tour on 12 July 1996. Other artists to have played at the stadium include Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds and Simply Red.|$|E

25|$|According to Abraham Gottlob Werner, {{the first}} phase of the Earth's {{development}} featured a great global ocean. This ocean <b>was</b> <b>hot,</b> steamy, and full of suspended sediment that eventually precipitated and formed bedrock. After this, the global ocean supposedly cooled and settled to such a degree that it began to subside and eventually conform to match the features seen today. During this time of subsidence, mountains were left behind as artifacts of erosion or a similar mechanism.|$|E
25|$|As {{a show of}} {{political}} strength, the Soviet Union tested the largest-ever nuclear weapon in October 1961, the massive Tsar Bomba, which was tested in a reduced state with a yield of around 50 megatons—in its full state it was estimated to have been around 100 Mt. The weapon was largely impractical for actual military use, but <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> enough to induce third-degree burns {{at a distance of}} 62mi (100km) away. In its full, dirty, design it would have increased the amount of worldwide fallout since 1945 by 25%.|$|E

Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him.

25|$|Islamic {{philosophers}} {{also made}} great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author {{in this regard}} was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was Takwin, the artificial creation {{of life in the}} alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness, coldness, dryness, and moistness. According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. By this reasoning, the search for the philosopher's stone was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{approaching}} Confederates {{were the}} Alabama Brigade of Hood's Division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Evander Law. (As the battle progressed and Law {{realized he was}} {{in command of the}} division, Col. James L. Sheffield was eventually notified to assume brigade command.) Dispatching the 4th, 15th, and 47th Alabama, and the 4th and 5th Texas to Little Round Top, Law ordered his men to take the hill. The men were exhausted, having marched more than 20 miles (32km) that day to reach this point. The day <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and their canteens were empty; Law's order to move out reached them before they could refill their water. Approaching the Union line on the crest of the hill, Law's men were thrown back by the first Union volley and withdrew briefly to regroup. The 15th Alabama, commanded by Col. William C. Oates, repositioned further right and attempted to find the Union left flank.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{rebellion}} by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to dig deep trenches, as it <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, and there was only one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders.|$|E
