40|$|As you sit {{in front}} of this book, reading these words, pause for a moment, listen, and ask yourself: What do I hear? Perhaps you hear some conversations going on in the background, some devices making noises of various kinds (an almost omnipresent feature of the modern world).

Almost certain is that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> auditory experience as one of oscillating air pressure in your ear canals that gently wiggle your ear drums. Yet strictly speaking, on the surface of it, that is all there ever is to “hearing. ” What makes hearing so rich is that brains display a remarkable ability to, in a sense, “reconstruct ” the very sources that have produced the vibration patterns that arrive at the ears, and by the time an auditory event impinges on a listener’s consciousness they are essentially unaware of sound waves, but instead hear—well— “something. ” What that thing is may be quite clear and easily put into words: a bicycle bell perhaps, or a voice. Note how readily people, when asked to identify a particular sound, might answer: “a telephone ” or “a dripping tap ” even though neither phones nor taps are, of course, sounds. Sounds are not things, yet people appear to try very hard to perceive them as such. Even when one cannot unambiguously identify a...|$|R

You might see faces of others, in shadow, or cheeks of others, turning, or jaws, or backs of necks, or eyes, dark under hats, which might remind you of others, whom once you knew, whom you thought long dead, but from whom you will still receive a sidelong glance, if you can face the good ghost.

30|$|Animal-assisted {{intervention}} (AAI) is {{an approach}} recently {{introduced into the}} hospital environment {{to improve the quality}} of hospitalization and provide important benefits for patients with chronic diseases and long-term hospitalizations. This work aims to verify the effects of animal-assisted activity (AAA) on the expression and quality of self-reported pain in hospitalized children and adolescents, while considering the subjects’ subjectivity. The participants were 17 hospitalized children/adolescents of both genders, aged 7  years and older, who complained of pain. Two therapy dogs were selected for the intervention according to the criteria of international protocols. The participants were asked an open question (“How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> pain?”). After the question, an AAA session, which lasted between 5 and 10  min, was held with random activities spontaneously chosen by the subject. The open question was asked again at the end of the session, without the presence of the dog. Positive effects were observed in this population with regard to a decrease in self-reported pain. These results suggest that there is a possible symbolic elaboration of pain by the subject, in which the dog might represent acceptance and affection at a moment of great emotional suffering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between overweight/obesity and self-rated health (SRH), and whether this relation varies by social factors. Data {{was taken from the}} German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS, baseline 2003 ‒ 2006). For the definition of overweight and obesity, body mass index was calculated based on standardized height and weight measurements. SRH of adolescents (n = 6813, 11 ‒ 17 years) was raised with the question: “How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> health in general? ” The response categories were “very good”, “good”, “fair”, “poor”, and “very poor”. We dichotomized these responses into: “very good/good ” vs. “fair/poor/very poor”. Socio-economic status (SES) in the family of origin and adolescents’ school type were analyzed as modifying factors. Prevalence and age-adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by binary logistic regression models. We found that overweight and obese boys and obese girls reported fair to very poor SRH more often than their normal weight peers, and that these differences were more apparent in early than late adolescence. In addition, {{the relation between}} obesity and SRH was similarly strong in all sub-groups, but there was seldom a relation between overweight and SRH. In summary...|$|E

40|$|The {{emotional}} impact of carrier detection for CF was assessed {{in a group}} of adults tested before 1992. Of the 200 adults who received a mailed questionnaire, 70 % participated. One third were CF gene carriers. The Health Orientation Scale (HOS) was used to evaluate perceived feelings about three situations: (a) How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> feelings about yourself when you consider your test result? (b) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they carry the CF gene? (c) How do you think most people feel when they are told that they do not carry the CF gene? Comparing the profiles of CF carriers and non-carriers, we found that carriers had significantly less positive feelings about themselves than non-carriers. Carriers as well as non-carriers attribute significantly more negative feelings to most carriers of the CF gene than to most non-carriers. Moreover, carriers of the Cf gene attribute more negative feelings to other CF carriers than to themselves. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of carrier status on self-description, as well as a significant effect of carrier status and degree of kinship with a CF patient on feelings attributed to most carriers. Although these results suggest some danger of stigmatization of CF carriers, the cognitive bias of 'illusory superiority' seems to counterbalance some of its effects. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Take a {{look around}} you. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> {{surroundings}} to best give {{an idea of what}} everything looks like to someone not there? Maybe you will give a category to the scene, say, ‘bedroom’. You might try to list some of the objects around you, like ‘bed’, ‘lamp’, and ‘desk’. Or perhaps you’ll describe it with adjectives like ‘indoors’, ‘cozy’, and ‘cluttered’. In computer vision, (or more specifically, in scene understanding), {{the most effective way to}} describe a visual scene is also a major question. Of the these three ways of describing a scene, (commonly referred to as categorization, scene parsing, and attribute-based representation respectively), categories have historically been the method of choice. In categorization, an image (scene) is allowed to fall into exactly one of an arbitrary number of buckets. Attribute representations, however, are typically composed of several sets of buckets each of which will have a value associated with that scene. For instance, a simple category-based model would place an image in one of urban/rural/room, whereas a binary attribute-based model would have as attributes indoors and warm, each of which are marked as either present or not. In larger models, this leads to high dimensionality for attribute-based models, which has been a large disincentive for its use. In addition, classifying a scene’s entire attribute set non-trivially falls unde...|$|E
