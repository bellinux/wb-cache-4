50|$|On {{or about}} Feb 7, 2009, a laid-off Qimonda {{employee}} began legal proceedings against Qimonda North America (QNA) for recompense for two months' worth of {{pay and benefits}} in a federal class-action lawsuit. The suit alleges that employees were not given their 60-day <b>written</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> or 60 days' severance pay required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (dubbed WARN). Qimonda argued that the “faltering company” exemption under WARN applies, which allows the company to fail to give notice where such advance notice may inhibit the company’s ability to find capital or business with which to continue operating. Several class action lawsuits were filed.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area <b>of</b> this <b>termination.</b> The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination.</b> The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination.</b> This chapter, {{with the help of the}} case law, deals with formal and content page <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> her delivery, <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> by employees and employers, prohibiting the possibility of [...] ...|$|R

The Work was submitted during the vacantia legis period (i. e. the period between the force and effect of the law) of Act. No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the "new Civil Code".

The first comprehensive regulation was drawn up in the period of the so called "First Republic" based on Act No. 83 / 1918 Coll, on Protection of Tenants.
