General Johnson was critical of Westmoreland's defused corporate style, considering him overattentive to <b>what</b> <b>government</b> officials wanted to hear. Nonetheless, Westmoreland was operating within longstanding army protocols of subordinating the military to civilian policymakers. The most important constraint was staying on the strategic defensive out of fear of Chinese intervention, {{but at the same time}} President Lyndon B. Johnson had made it clear that there was a higher commitment to defending Vietnam. Much of the thinking about defense was by academics turned government advisors who concentrated on nuclear weapons, seen as making conventional war obsolete. The fashion for counter-insurgency thinking also denigrated the role of conventional warfare. Despite the inconclusive outcome of the Korean War, Americans expected their wars to end with the unconditional surrender of the enemy.|$|E

500|$|Under the Fourth Amendment, {{search and}} seizure (including arrest) should be limited in scope {{according}} to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it.

Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's physical intrusion onto private property, but with Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals {{as well as physical}} locations.

[...] The California Constitution mandates that the “protection of the public safety is the first responsibility of local government and local officials have an obligation to give priority to the provision of adequate public safety services.” [...] This constitutional obligation exists regardless of whether a local tax measure is approved by voters.

[...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making <b>what</b> <b>government</b> regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products.
