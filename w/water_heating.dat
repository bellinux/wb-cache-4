5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar <b>water</b> <b>heating</b> attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar <b>water</b> <b>heating</b> sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar <b>water</b> <b>heating</b> and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study and explain the purpose and the {{function}} of drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. The thesis goes over theory behind heat transfer and heat exchangers and presents the general solutions of domestic drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery systems. Systems gone over in detail are the different general shower drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery systems. Another part of the thesis is {{a case study of}} an actual shower drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery system of a Finnish household. The purpose of the case study is to study the actual temperature increase of cold water in a drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery unit and efficiency of such heat exchanger. An alternate goal is to study the difference in efficiency values and temperature gains between two heat exchangers of the same model, where the other has been used significantly more than the other. In other words, another target is to study the fouling effect. The calculations are done using real measurement data. The most important findings are that utilizing a shower drain heat recovery unit provides real energy savings in the long run, {{and that there is a}} significant difference of efficiency between a dirty and a clean <b>heat</b> exchanger. Drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery systems provided as high as 15 Â°C increase in the temperature of cold <b>water.</b> A clean <b>heat</b> exchanger boasts an impressive 50. 4 % efficiency, whereas the dirtier heat exchanger provides a 36. 1 % efficiency. The results can be further used to calculate the energy savings of the household on a yearly basis. Furthermore, the results show that domestic drain <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> recovery could potentially make a significant difference in national energy usage if implemented nationwide...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a project researching the application of <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pipes in CubeSats. Heat pipes are proposed to solve for the increase in CubeSat power density, being one of the main thermal challenges appearing in high-performance missions. Commercial off the shelve <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pipes have been tested and a proof-of-concept design has been made showing the flexibility of heat pipe integration. Thermal tests reflecting a common hot- and cold case experienced in low-Earth orbit, have been carried out. These tests have proven that the <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pipe is capable of keeping a single component generating a continuous heat dissipation of 10 W, within a reasonable temperature range and successfully start-up from a frozen state before temperature limits are breached. The outcome of this research has shown that <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pipes can be the thermal solution for high performance CubeSat missions...|$|R

40|$|Ground-source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) systems {{are perhaps the}} most widely used âsustainableâ heating and cooling systems, with an {{estimated}} 1. 7 million installed units with total installed heating capacity on the order of 18 GW. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and institutional buildings. Standing column wells (SCW) are one form of ground heat exchanger that, under the right geological conditions, can provide excellent energy efficiency at a relatively low capital cost. Closed-loop surface <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pump (SWHP) systems utilize surface <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers (SWHE) to reject or extract heat from nearby surface water bodies. For building near surface water bodies, these systems also offer a high degree of energy efficiency at a low capital cost. However, there have been few design tools available for properly sizing standing column wells or surface <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers. Nor have tools for analyzing the energy consumption and supporting economics-based design decisions been available. The main contributions of this project lie in providing new tools that support design and energy analysis. These include a design tool for sizing surface <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers, a design tool for sizing standing column wells, a new model of surface <b>water</b> <b>heat</b> pump systems implemented in EnergyPlus and a new model of standing column wells implemented in EnergyPlus.
