25|$|Some memoirs have {{revived the}} {{simmering}} controversy over <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what,</b> exactly, {{was to blame}} for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon. Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much, if not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later Gemini and Apollo programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.|$|E

Angel ends up {{fighting}} a walking volcano, and must try and survive long enough to discover <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> is behind the recent strange series of events. Finally, the strange evil reveals itself; Perfect Zheng, a vampire who beat Angel up in the 1920s. Angel, Wesley, Cordelia, and Gunn try to put the pieces together in time {{to make sense of}} present events, a possible product of Angel's past encounter with Zheng. In fact, as it turns out, the gypsy curse that was used on Angel was meant to be used on Zheng, turning him into the 'vampire champion', but it didn't take, and Zheng is determined to find out why Angel's soul was restored and his wasn't. A battle for survival between the pair ensues, which Angel wins. Supposed to be set early in the second season of Angel. Collected in Angel: Long Night's Journey.|$|E

He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound." [...] A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed [...] "Remember a Day" [...] from A Saucerful of Secrets, written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him. Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the [...] "backbone" [...] of Pink Floyd.|$|E

Ian continues to develop rapidly; within a day, he appears as a four-year-old child with corresponding mental faculties. Troi, Picard and Pulaski observe Ian (Zachary Benjamin) purposely putting himself in harm's way, seemingly just for the experience. When asked if {{he is ready to}} explain <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he is, though, Ian responds [...] "not yet." [...] Having completed the transfer of the virus samples, the Enterprise heads for the Starfleet Medical station.

He came to Earth years before the others and assumed the form of a human boy, Masaya Aoyama, to avoid detection. Deep Blue went to sleep within his new body, leaving Masaya with no memories of <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he really is, but retaining some of Deep Blue's disgust for the way humans were treating the environment. Despite being the primary antagonist, Deep Blue does not actually appear until the end of the sixth volume of the manga. Deep Blue is cold natured, cruel hearted, and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Upon awakening, he attacks and injures Ichigo as he does not share Masaya's love for her, and kills Quiche without any hesitation when challenged to a duel. This allows Masaya to temporarily re-emerge and release Mew Aqua inside his body, killing them both.|$|E
500|$|The Navy's {{conclusions}} {{were heavily}} criticised by the victim's families, the media, and congress. After a test {{found that an}} overram of the powder bags into the gun could have caused the explosion, the Navy reopened the investigation. On October 17, 1991, Frank Kelso, the new Navy Chief of Naval Operations, announced that the Navy could not determine <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> had caused the tragedy. Kelso apologized to Hartwig's family and closed the Navy's investigation. [...] An independent review of the Navy's investigation by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained. [...] Soon after, 60 Minutes broadcast an updated story on the Navy's investigation. The report, written and produced by Thompson and Wallace, included an interview with Kelso.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's two {{previous}} albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and Another Side of Bob Dylan both {{ended with a}} farewell song, [...] "Restless Farewell" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe" [...] respectively. [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] concludes Bringing It All Back Home in consistent fashion. Much speculation has surrounded <b>who</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> the [...] "Baby Blue" [...] to whom Dylan is singing farewell is. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars {{believe that it is}} probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez. Dylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. Another possibility is a singer-songwriter named David Blue. A friend or acquaintance of Dylan's from his days in New York's Greenwich Village, Blue is pictured on the cover of Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes album wearing a trench coat. Yet another possibility is Dylan's one-time friend, folk singer Paul Clayton. Although Clayton had been Dylan's friend throughout 1964, and had accompanied Dylan on the road trip across the United States on which [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] were written, by 1965 he may have become more devoted to Dylan than Dylan was comfortable with, and Clayton's use of amphetamines may have made him difficult to be around. However, author Paul Williams, in his book Performing Artist: Book One 1960–1973, counters that [...] "Dylan may have been thinking of a particular person as he wrote it, but not necessarily", adding that the song has such a natural, flowing structure to it, that it could [...] "easily have finished writing itself before Dylan got around to thinking about who 'Baby Blue' was." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Yogasutras of Patanjali use {{the term}} Isvara in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45.

These commentaries range from defining Isvara from a [...] "personal god" [...] to [...] "special self" [...] to [...] "anything that has spiritual significance to the individual". Whicher states that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of Isvara in Yoga philosophy functions as a [...] "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin {{on the path to}} spiritual emancipation".|$|E
