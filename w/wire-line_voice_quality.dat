40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to explain post-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> by {{exploring}} several factors influencing the chances of recovery from dysphonia. Furthermore we aimed to establish whether explanatory variables are linked to <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> via a moderating effect. Study-design: Prospective observational study Method: <b>Voice</b> <b>quality</b> of 55 dysphonic patients (recruited by 16 speech language pathologists) was rated on three occasions on a visual analogue scale (VAS) by the author. From these ratings we computed plasticity of <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> Furthermore we obtained assessments of the overall <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> before and after diagnostic probing from patients and their speech language pathologists (SLP’s). From these assessments absolute audible differences (AAD’s) were computed. Lastly, patients were administered self-assessment questionnaires. Through sequential multiple regression analyses, models were built to explain post-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> above pre-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> alone. Results: The full regression model including <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> at T 0 and including AAD did explain 72 % of the variation in post-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> on a spoken phrase and was statistically significant. The model of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> on a vowel was also statistically significant and explained 58 % of the variation in post-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> It included pre-therapeutic <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> plasticity of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> and an interaction variable. Conclusions: This study proves some influence of perpetuating factors on <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> but does not provide clinical guidance. Future prognostic studies are needed to identify modifiable causes in order to tackle them as an essential part of tailor-made treatment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>quality,</b> {{defined by}} John Laver as the {{characteristic}} auditory colouring of a speaker’s voice, {{is a significant}} feature of speech, and {{it is used to}} signal various properties such as emotions, intentions, and mood of the speaker.

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>quality</b> {{variability}} {{is due to}} supra-segmental influences {{but also}} to segmental factors like phoneme class, vowel quality, nasalization, airstream mechanism etc. These factors determine a rather unexplored micro-prosodic phenomenon: the phone-intrinsic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> which causes <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> coarticulation and <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> transitions in fluent speech. I subsume all these phenomena under the high-frequency components of prosody. Since high-frequency and low-frequency components (supra-segmentals) of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> prosody are superposed and thus encoded, the main goal of the present investigation is to separate them and make both accessible to speech research. In 2003 a holistic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> parameter extractor was introduced by Mokhtari, Pfitzinger & Ishi [10]: It applies a principal component analysis to a database of glottal-flow waveforms {{for the purpose of}} analysing and reconstructing all underlying glottal-flow waveforms from just a few principal components. By applying this basic principle to a large corpus of 92, 167 manually segmented glottal-flow waveforms of 44 speakers I dramatically improved its applicability to any speech signals. Subsequent high-pass and low-pass filtering of the resulting <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> parameters yielded phone-intrinsic <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> parameter sets as well as slowly varying <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> parameter contours.

40|$|In {{emotional}} speech research, it {{has been}} suggested that loudness, along with other prosodic features, may be an important cue in communicating high activation affects. In earlier studies, we found different <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> stimuli to be consistently associated with certain affective states. In these stimuli, as in typical human productions, the different <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> entailed differences in loudness. To examine the extent to which the loudness differences among these <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> might influence the affective coloring they impart, two experiments were conducted with the synthesized stimuli, in which loudness was systematically manipulated. Experiment 1 used stimuli with distinct <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> features including intrinsic loudness variations and stimuli where <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> (modal <b>voice)</b> was kept constant, but loudness was modified to match the non-modal qualities. If loudness is the principal determinant in affect cueing for different <b>voice</b> <b>qualities,</b> there should be little or no difference in the responses to the two sets of stimuli. In Experiment 2, the stimuli included distinct <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> features but all had equal loudness to test the hypothesis that equalizing the perceived loudness of different <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> stimuli will have relatively little impact on affective ratings.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a strategy}} for exploring the paralinguistic signalling of emotion, mood and attitude. The focus here is {{on the role of}} <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> and the approach adopted involves three distinct phases. The first involves detailed acoustic analyses of a range of <b>voice</b> <b>qualities.</b> The second involves the resynthesis and perceptual testing of individual <b>voice</b> <b>qualities.</b> The third stage, and the main focus of the present paper, involves the elicitation of the perceived affective colouring of <b>voice</b> <b>qualities.</b> A pilot experiment is described where listeners’ reactions to seven <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> were elicited in terms of eight pairs of opposing affective attributes: ratings were obtained for each pair on a seven-point scale. Results confirm that <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> adjustments can alone evoke rather different affective colourings. Broadly, present results suggest an initial dichotomy between <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> that are associated with more aroused and aggressive states, and those associated with a more relaxed and unaggressive state. There is some support for traditional impressionistic observations (such as the association of creaky voice with boredom). However, results suggest some refinements on these, and suggest that there is no simple one-toone mapping between affective state and <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> Those affective attributes that correspond to speaker state, mood and attitude were more readily perceived for these seven <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> than were emotions per se. 1...|$|R

40|$|Different <b>voice</b> <b>qualities</b> tend to vary {{in terms}} of their {{intrinsic}} loudness. Perceptual experiments have shown that <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> variation can be strongly associated with the affective colouring of an utterance. The question addressed in this paper concerns the role that the intrinsic loudness variation might play in this voice quality-to-affect mapping. To test the hypothesis that the intrinsic loudness variation is not a major determinant of the perceived affective colouring, listeners rated the affective colouring of two series of stimuli: one series varied in <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> and contained intrinsic loudness variation; the other series were of a constant <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> but matched loudness variations of the first series. The results overall support the hypothesis that loudness contributes relatively little to the perceived affective colouring of specific <b>voice</b> <b>qualities.</b> But variation in loudness (in the absence of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> variation) is not entirely irrelevant: some contribution of loudness to certain high activation affects was also found. 1...|$|R

The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, we present a new methodology for developing perceptually accurate models for nonintrusive prediction of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> which avoids timeconsuming subjective tests. The methodology is generic and as such it has wide applicability in multimedia applications. Second, based on the new methodology, we present efficient regression models for predicting conversational <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> nonintrusively for four modern codecs (G. 729, G. 723. 1, AMR and iLBC). Third, we illustrate the usefulness of the models in two main applications—voice quality prediction for real Internet VoIP traces and perceived quality-driven playout buffer optimization. For <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> prediction, the results show that the models have accuracy close to the combined ITU PESQ/E-model method using real Internet traces (correlation coefficient over 0. 98).

Several significant relationships were found. Imaging with videofluoroscopy revealed that the following anatomic and functional parameters (established during phonation) are related to voice quality: presence of a neoglottic bar, regurgitation of barium, tonicity of the neoglottis, and minimal neoglottic distance. Furthermore, the index of the increase of the maximal subneoglottic distance from rest to phonation also showed a significant relationship with <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> Imaging with digital high-speed endoscopy revealed features relevant to <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> including amount of saliva, visibility of the origin of the neoglottis, shape of the neoglottis, and regularity of the vibration.

40|$|IP {{networks}} {{are on a}} steep slope of innovation that will make them the long-term carrier {{of all types of}} traffic, including voice. However, such {{networks are}} not designed to support real-time voice communication because their variable characteristics (e. g. due to delay, delay variation and packet loss) lead to a deterioration in <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> A major challenge in such networks is how to measure or predict <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> accurately and efficiently for QoS monitoring and/or control purposes to ensure that technical and commercial requirements are met. <b>Voice</b> <b>quality</b> can be measured using either subjective or objective methods. Subjective measurement (e. g. MOS) is the benchmark for objective methods, but it is slow, time consuming and expensive. Objective measurement can be intrusive or non-intrusive. Intrusive methods (e. g. ITU PESQ) are more accurate, but normally are unsuitable for monitoring live traffic because of the need for a reference data and to utilise the network. This makes non-intrusive methods(e. g. ITU E-model) more attractive for monitoring <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> from IP network impairments. However, current non-intrusive methods rely on subjective tests to derive model parameters and as a result are limited and do not meet new and emerging applications. The main goal of the project is to develop novel and efficient models for non-intrusive speech quality prediction to overcome the disadvantages of current subjective-based methods and to demonstrate their usefulness in new and emerging VoIP applications. The main contributions of the thesis are fourfold: (1) a detailed understanding of the relationships between <b>voice</b> <b>quality,</b> IP network impairments (e. g. packet loss, jitter and delay) and relevant parameters associated with speech (e. g. codec type, gender and language) is provided. An understanding of the perceptual effects of these key parameters on <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> is important as it provides a basis for the development of non-intrusive <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> prediction models. A fundamental investigation {{of the impact of the}} parameters on perceived <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> was carried out using the latest ITU algorithm for perceptual evaluation of speech quality, PESQ, and by exploiting the ITU E-model to obtain an objective measure of <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> (2) a new methodology to predict <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> non-intrusively was developed. The method exploits the intrusive algorithm, PESQ, and a combined PESQ/E-model structure to provide a perceptually accurate prediction of both listening and conversational <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> non-intrusively. This avoids time-consuming subjective tests and so removes one of the major obstacles in the development of models for <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> prediction. The method is generic and as such has wide applicability in multimedia applications. Efficient regression-based models and robust artificial neural network-based learning models were developed for predicting <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> non-intrusively for VoIP applications. (3) three applications of the new models were investigated: <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> monitoring/prediction for real Internet VoIP traces, perceived quality driven playout buffer optimization and perceived quality driven QoS control. The neural network and regression models were both used to predict <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> for real Internet VoIP traces based on international links. A new adaptive playout buffer and a perceptual optimization playout buffer algorithms are presented. A QoS control scheme that combines the strengths of rate-adaptive and priority marking control schemes to provide a superior QoS control in terms of measured perceived <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> is also provided. (4) a new methodology for Internet-based subjective speech quality measurement which allows rapid assessment of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> for VoIP applications is proposed and assessed using both objective and traditional MOS test methods.

40|$|Skype, one of {{the popular}} VoIP applications, has its own {{redundancy}} mechanism to mitigate the impact of packet loss {{at the expense of}} additional bandwidth usage. However, the benefit of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> improvement through redundancy is reduced greatly in the case of consecutive loss of Skype packets. When Skype is running over wireless networks, the high likelihood of having consecutive packet loss in a noisy wireless environment could lead to an interesting scenario: using more bandwidth for a lower <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> In this thesis, we study the impact of the HARQ retransmission mechanism of WiMAX to the <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> of Skype. Two key parameters for the HARQ mechanism of WiMAX (i. e.

In this paper, we propose ES-to-Speech using regression techniques to make it possible to manually control the converted <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> by manipulating a few intuitively controllable parameters even if no target voice sample is available. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by experimental evaluations.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> in the {{teaching}} of pronunciation and argues that since <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> encompasses so many aspects of phonology, it provides a useful point of departure for pronunciation work. A teaching technique is described, in which the concept of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> is used in communicative practice to give students the opportunity to identify meaningful aspects of suprasegmental pronunciation, and see how they fit into the overall pattern of connected speech...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nigeria with infant GSM mobile {{subscribers}} {{is mostly}} {{concerned about the}} quality of services they received from the GSM operators in the country. Nigeria is also concerned about the factors affecting <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> such as degradation of speech (voice), messages and other anomalies encountered. The paper focuses on the evaluation of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> of some GSM operators in the country. It looks into seven items used to measure the dimension of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> such as echo of the sender’s voice, distortion in the receiver’s voice, volume of the receiver’s voice and overall <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> perception. In this paper a survey design was used. The sample consists of 300 subscribers and these were selected by stratified random sampling technique. Questionnaire containing twenty six (26) items on factors affecting <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> level in mobile communication was administered to the various categories of subscribers of mobile communication in Oyo State, Nigeria. Mean and standard deviation was used to answer six research questions. Results show that the highest overall mean opinion score is 3. 10 and the least value is 2. 93. It therefore implies that the <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> levels are above average for the four GSM service providers under investigatio...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{two methods}} for {{automatically}} classifying <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> are compared: regression analysis and hidden Markov models (HMMs). The {{findings of this}} research show that HMMs {{can be used to}} classify <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> The HMMs performed better than the regression models in classifying breathiness and overall degree of deviance, and the two methods showed similar results on the roughness scale. However, the results are not spectacular. This is mainly due to the type of material that was available and the number of listeners who assessed the material. Nonetheless, I argue in this paper that these findings are interesting because they are a promising step towards developing a system for classifying <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> The speech material used in these series of 1. INTRODUCTION Automatically evaluating <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> could be useful in a clinical practice. It is known that listeners are inconsistent in judging pathological <b>voice</b> <b>quality.</b> One listener can give a different assessment of the s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{introduce}} a new strategy and tools for <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> research that complements conventional approaches. Avery high-quality speech analysis, modification and synthesis procedure STRAIGHT, which is basically a channel VOCODER based on a pitch-synchronous analysis synthesis framework, was extended to implement auditory morphing in terms of spectral, pitch and <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> parameters. This extension enables <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> modification by parametric transformation using STRAIGHT. It also enables an exemplar-based research strategy for perceptual aspects of <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> analysis and control. In other words, manipulated synthetic voice having virtually equivalent naturalness to natural voice introduces a mean to perform a unique research strategy called systematic downgrading, that is suitable especially for para and nonlinguistic aspects of human vocalization. In addition to morphing procedure, a set of visualization techniques were introduced based on fixed-point analyses in {{the time and the}} frequency domain for assisting exploratory data analysis that is indispensable in <b>voice</b> <b>quality</b> research. 1...|$|R
