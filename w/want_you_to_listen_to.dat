[...] He {{came out of the}} control booth and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot, some pretty tough looking {{customers}} - and I'd had enough. [...] I just said, 'Hey Waylon!' [...] And he turned. [...] I said, 'I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to, and if you don't listen to 'em I'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody.' And boy, whew. [...] Man! [...] Everything got quiet and them old boys started formin' and Waylon stopped 'em. [...] He said, 'Hoss, you don't know how close you come to gettin' killed.' [...] I said, 'Well, I've had enough.

6000|$|Courthorne {{seemed to}} have heard him, for he smiled a little as he glanced at Barrington. [...] "I'm afraid it will hurt <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear what I have to tell this gentleman," [...] he said. [...] "Now, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> carefully, and every word put down. Doctor, a little more brandy." ...|$|R

There was a contact from the EMI side and it was told that she does [...] "not have anything right now due to being young on age, but I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> when I can play a song." ...|$|R

I must preface my remarks by reminding you that the Suffraget movement is essentially a dowdy movement. The suffragets are not all dowdies; but they are mainly supported by dowdies. Now I am not a dowdy. Oh, no compliments-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{laughed a}} little. [...] "Well," [...] he said dryly, [...] "it {{seems to me}} that the poor man should do a little of the holding off himself. Now I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> carefully. Within twelve months you'll see a new wagon-road cut south towards the big river, and inside two years the {{surveyors}} running the line for a new railroad into the Somasco valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> Tony, and I am {{not going}} to find fault with you,” she said. “When you showed your {{preference}} for me people who I know are wise talked <b>to</b> me of <b>you.</b> They had very little <b>to</b> urge against <b>you</b> except one thing, which I think is true. They said you were a trifle too fond of shirking a difficulty.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this is what}} I want," [...] {{continued}} Ziffa; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> {{the talk}} of Rais Ali and the sailor who lives with you, when they don't know you are near, and tell me all that they say about a family named Rimini--will you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Felps," [...] began Snap, after {{a painful}} pause, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what I have to say. Last night our rowboat with our outfit on board disappeared. I don't {{know if it}} drifted off or was stolen. If it was stolen, and we find it out, {{somebody}} is going to be arrested for the theft." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> while I {{tell you}} one of the worst actions of my life,' he said in a low tone, {{weakened}} by the suffering through which he had passed. 'The memory of it has haunted me always; it is the memory of it which has brought me here. I am not confessing <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> mind! only after I have told you this story, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pray for me.|$|R

You'll need support under you while I'm throwin' my yarn. Story of my life, Bill." [...] He placed a chair for Madeline. [...] "Miss Hammond, beggin' your pardon again, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen,</b> also. You've the face an' eyes {{of a woman who}} loves to hear of other people's happiness. Besides, somehow, it's easy for me to talk lookin' at you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> seriously, Bob," [...] she said, and {{her voice}} was serious. [...] "I like you very much--I always have--and I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> seriously. All of us have friends. Some people--you, for instance--have a great many. We have but one father." [...] Her voice failed a little at the word. [...] "No friend can {{ever be the same}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as your father, and no {{friendship}} can make up what his displeasure will cost you. I do not mean to say that I shan't always be your friend, for I shall be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get up!" [...] said Brooke, almost sharply. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me. If {{it suits}} {{you to stay}} here by yourself, you can; in the meanwhile, do what you like, which will, of course, be very little, with the ranch. In return, I'll only ask you {{to take care of}} the fiddle until I send for it. I'm going away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't talk any more," [...] he said, [...] "but I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me {{just for}} a moment. The doctor {{will be here to}} see you in five minutes. The nurse sent for him as soon as she saw that you were conscious. It is very {{possible}} that he will ask you to tell him before witnesses how you received your wound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} we can manage it;--but I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me first. Lord Lovel is back in London." [...] She pressed her lips {{together}} and fastened one hand firmly on the other. If the assurance that was required from her was ever to be exacted, it should not be exacted by Serjeant Bluestone. [...] "I have seen his lordship to-day," [...] continued the Serjeant, [...] "and he has done me the honour to promise that he will dine here to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> while I {{read the}} {{concluding}} passages in this letter," [...] said Miss Halcombe. [...] "Tell {{me if you}} think they throw any light upon your strange adventure {{on the road to}} London. The letter is addressed by my mother to her second husband, Mr. Fairlie, and the date refers to a period of between eleven and twelve years since. At that time Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie, and my half-sister Laura, had been living for years in this house; and I was away from them completing my education at a school in Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} to finish, partner, because there's a reason you should hear it all. By and by Father Herman had to nurse us both, and when I got better Hattie died. We buried her by torchlight in the dusty mission yard--she was a Catholic--you'll see the marble cross. I've been lonely ever since, and that's partly why I sent for you; Peter came next <b>to</b> Hattie and <b>you</b> are Peter's son. Now I'm ready to pull out and somehow I think Hattie will find me when I'm {{wandering}} in the dark. Love like hers is strong. But I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> when <b>you</b> have given me another drink." ...|$|R

If you had brought him the artistic {{temperament}} on a plate with a bit of watercress round it, he wouldn't have recognized it. And now, just because he's got a studio, he thinks he has a right to go up in the air if you speak to him suddenly and run about the place hitting snakes with teaspoons as if he were Michelangelo!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if I were to {{say that}} I accused you, perhaps you would {{misunderstand}} me. I hope--I thoroughly expect, that before I leave you, I {{may be able to}} say that I do not accuse you. If you will only listen to me patiently for a few minutes, Margaret--which I couldn't get you to do, you know, before you went away from the Cedars in that very extraordinary manner--I think I can explain to you something which--" [...] Here Lady Ball became embarrassed, and paused; but Margaret gave her no assistance, and therefore she began a new sentence. [...] "In point of fact, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> what I say, and then, I think--I do think--you will do as we would have you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago, Yancey," [...] he began, [...] "you {{asked me if}} I had brought Stella and Lucy over to play. You weren't quite awake then, and must have been dreaming you were a boy again. You are awake now, and I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me. I have come from Stella and Lucy to their old playmate, and to my old friend's son. They know that I am {{going to bring you}} home with me, and you will find them as ready with a welcome {{as they were in the}} old days. I want you to come to my house and stay until you are {{yourself}} again, and as much longer as you will. We heard of your being down in the world, and in the midst of temptation, and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more. Will you come, my boy? Will you drop our old family trouble and come with me?" ...|$|E

I’ve taken up a good many risky deals and put them through, fighting the men who meant to down me as best I could; but all my business hasn’t been a raid on somebody else’s property. In fact, you can’t play the bold pirate too often. Very well; now and then, when I was doing an innocent trade, I wanted a respectable associate {{as a kind of}} guarantee, and asked your father to stand in. He’s known as a straight man, and my having him helped to disarm suspicion; I’ll admit that I found him useful in that respect. I hope I’ve said enough to satisfy you?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Grace," [...] I said huskily, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> while I {{answer a}} {{question}} which, without speaking, you asked me--Why should I, a rough railroad contractor, esteem it an inestimable privilege to freely lay down my life for you? It is only because I love you, and have done so from the day we talked together on Starcross Moor--it seems so long ago. Listen yet. I meant never <b>to</b> have told <b>you</b> until I had {{won the right to}} do so, and had something to offer the heiress of Carrington, and I fought hard for it, toiling late and early, with a dead weight of adverse fortune against me; but all that was little when every blow was struck for your sweet sake. And, if you had chosen another, I should have kept my secret, and prayed that you might be happy. Now when, so far as worldly rank goes, we stand as equals in the valley of death, I dare open all my heart to you; and, if it must be, I should ask no better end than to enter eternity here holding your hand." ...|$|R

You know, my dear boy, that I am your father's oldest friend, {{and right}} sure I am {{that he would}} approve of what I say. You must come home with me to live. I know that in his last hours the great concern of your dear father's heart {{would have been for}} the future of his boy. And I know, too, that it was a comfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, and that the son of my dearest old friend would be as a son to me. We have been friends, you and I, a long time, Harold; and we have learned to trust, and I hope to love, one another. And you and my little Stephen are such friends already that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all. Why, long ago, when first you came, she said to me the night you went away: [...] "Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?"' ...|$|E

'You slaved and sacrificed and denied {{yourself}} when I was a boy to send me to school, without which I would never have got to Oxford at all; and you taught me music in your spare hours (when you had any); and I owe everything I have or am or ever will be to your unceasing and indefatigable kindness. So now you've got to take repayment whether you will or not, for I insist upon it. And if you won't come up to Oxford, which perhaps would be an uncongenial place for you in many ways, I'll tell you what I'll do, Daddy; I'll look out for a curacy somewhere in London, and we'll take a little house together, and I'll furnish it nicely, and there we shall live, sir, whatever you say, so not another word about it. And now I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the very best thing I've ever composed, {{and tell me what you}} think of it.' ...|$|E

As you know, certain {{property}} will revert to me eventually, but, remembering what is in our blood, I dare not trust myself to drag out a life of idleness or monotonous drudgery, waiting for the future here. The curse is a very real thing--and it would not be fair to you. Now I can save enough from the wreck to start us without positive hardship over seas, and George has written offering me a small share in his Australian cattle-run. You shall want for nothing, Millicent, that toil can win you, and I know that, with you to help me, I shall achieve at least a competence." ...|$|E
