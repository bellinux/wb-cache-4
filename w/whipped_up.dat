5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts to control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Kyle produced record breaking rains over Puerto Rico from September21 to 23. With isolated maxima {{in excess of}} 30inches (760mm), rivers breached their flood walls and flooded low-lying areas. In Patillas, a 500-year 24‑hour rainfall event took place, with 22.03in (559.5mm) falling from 8a.m. on September21 to 8a.m. on September22. Some rivers rose more than 25ft (7.6m) in 12hours, leading to severe flooding. Three deaths were directly blamed on {{the system as a}} result of the floods and mudslides. Another three deaths were indirectly related due to stress induced heart attacks. Mudslides, triggered by the torrential rain, closed highways and schools. Damage to agriculture on the island was estimated to be $23million and structural damage was estimated at $25million, for a total of $48 million. In addition to the system's rainfall, its winds <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> 10ft (3m) waves along the island's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E

He and his remaining soldiers were assumed to have drowned at sea, as a tropical storm <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> soon afterwards. However, there have been suggestions that his death was simply Mongolian propaganda, since no remains or trace of his fleet were ever found.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} coastal {{problems}} were in Massachusetts. The heaviest snow {{was in the}} central part of the state, where snow amounts of up to 20inches (50cm) were reported. Coastal areas, particularly around Nantucket, saw lesser amounts (approximately 12") as it was mixed with sleet at times, but winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> the ocean with storm surges of 2 to 3feet (60 to 90cm) and led to some coastal flooding, plus offshore waves of up to 25feet (8 m). Logan International Airport in Boston and Barnstable municipal airport in Hyannis on Cape Cod saw over 90% of their flights cancelled at the peak of the storm.|$|E
25|$|This episode saw the Challenge's {{youngest}} competitor Sandy, go {{up against}} food writer Katie and lovable Ivan the posty. The signature dish round got the show off to a great start. Ivan prepared a unique combination of flavours with his rabbit thighs with mint pineapple. Sandy's spicy lamb served on a char grilled vegetable stack proved to the judges she was very accomplished behind the grill, despite her age. The always articulate Katie from Brisbane went for a cheaper option and <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> some steak fajitas. Mark's screen test round belonged to Ivan who's theatrical training helped put him clearly {{in front of the}} competition. In the final round the kiddies were the judges and Ivan was declared the winner and Katie was given a second chance as a wild card.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, Peadar O'Donnell and then George Gilmore went to Spain on behalf of the Congress to report on proceedings, and returned enthusiastic supporters of the Spanish Republicans. Ryan was incensed at quasi-Fascist Blueshirt leader Eoin O'Duffy organising an Irish Brigade to fight with the Fascists, and in open letters to the papers criticised Cardinal McRory for raising funds at church collections to support Franco. The Congress started publicising the Spanish Republican cause in public meetings. This was no easy task, given the strength of pro-Franco feeling at the time, which was <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> by sections of the Catholic Church and the Irish Independent. Pro-Republican meetings were frequently challenged, and on one occasion Ryan had to climb up a lamp-post to escape from a crowd which attacked a meeting he was addressing in York Street.|$|E
25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> like egg whites.|$|E
25|$|In the UK the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, passed at {{the onset}} of the First World War, gave the {{government}} wide-ranging powers to requisition property and to criminalise specific activities. A moral panic was <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> by the press in 1916 over the alleged sale of drugs to the troops of the British Indian Army. With the temporary powers of DORA, the Army Council quickly banned the sale of all psychoactive drugs to troops, unless required for medical reasons. However, shifts in the public attitude towards drugs—they were beginning to be associated with prostitution, vice and immorality—led the government to pass further unprecedented laws, banning and criminalising the possession and dispensation of all narcotics, including opium and cocaine. After the war, this legislation was maintained and strengthened with the passing of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920. Home Office control was extended to include raw opium, morphine, cocaine, ecogonine and heroin.|$|E

25|$|After a {{disastrous}} fire leveled {{much of the}} downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings {{in the area to}} be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked more at home in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. <b>Whipped</b> <b>up</b> by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard {{on the edge of the}} community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, and for a second time a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.|$|E
25|$|Annadurai {{formed the}} Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949 after {{splitting}} from Dravidar Kazhagam. DMK {{also decided to}} oppose the 'expansion of the Hindi culture' in Tamil Nadu and started the demand for a separate homeland for the Dravidians in the South. The demand was for an Independent state called Dravida Nadu (country of Dravidians) comprising Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala. The increased involvement of the Indian National Congress party in Madras during the late 1950s and the strong pan-Indian emotions <b>whipped</b> <b>up</b> by the Chinese invasion of India in 1962 led to the demand for Dravida Nadu losing some of its immediacy. Consequently, in 1963, when the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of India, precluded secessionist parties from contesting elections, the DMK chose to formally drop its demand for an independent Dravida Nadu, focusing instead on securing greater functional autonomy {{within the framework of}} the Indian Constitution.|$|E
