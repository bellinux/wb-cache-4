6000|$|... "If any man {{had told}} me," [...] pursues Jobling, [...] "even so lately as <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had the frisk down in Lincolnshire, Guppy, and drove {{over to see}} that house at Castle Wold--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we could}} only keep the pine grove!" [...] she sighed. [...] "Do you {{remember}} what good times {{we had in the}} farmhouse, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to go off for whole days together?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Urmston {{appeared}} {{to glance at}} her reproachfully. [...] "There was a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could be content without a word. Silence is now and then wonderfully expressive. Thoughts are often spoiled by being forced into clumsy speech." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tut! Let us {{have done}} with that. WE know very well how it was. Why should you and I talk about it, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't {{disguise}} it? To proceed. I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite sure. Only say {{you will}} let me leave <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>and</b> how <b>I</b> please--only say you won't {{interfere}} with me. Will you promise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Duke! He and I {{have seen}} {{a great deal of}} each other since,--since the days <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to meet. He knows nothing about all this, and the worst of it is, he is not in a {{condition}} to be told." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t {{hear what}} <b>you</b> were saying, <b>and</b> then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went outside <b>and</b> <b>I</b> asked <b>you</b> {{whether you were}} going home you said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't care {{anything}} about your desires," [...] said Margery, {{in a tone}} which showed she was truly vexed, [...] "I have pre-empted this place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want it to myself. I was just falling into a most delightful doze <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think <b>you</b> have any right {{to come here and}} disturb me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see he's {{giving you}} a long rope," [...] said the Captain. [...] "But that can't change a man's convictions. I know the Author respects me; I feel it in my bones: <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had that talk at the {{blockhouse}} door, {{who do you think}} he was for, my man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not in this respect,' said Tom Pinch. 'You must excuse me, John. I cannot, really; I will not. It's very wrong; {{you should}} be more guarded in your expressions. It was bad enough <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to be alone together, but under {{existing}} circumstances, I can't endure it, really. No. I cannot, indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [A] In {{a letter}} to Wilkinson, {{accompanying}} a copy of these verses, which Wordsworth sent from Coleorton, in November 1806, he wrote: [...] "They {{are supposed to have}} been composed that afternoon <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were labouring together in your pleasure-ground."

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{continued}} Blakeney gaily, [...] "I remember now.... Faith! {{to think}} that I was nigh forgetting that <b>when</b> last <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> met, sir, <b>you</b> had just taken or were about to take Holy Orders.... Ah! how well {{the thought of the}} Angelus fits in with your clerical garb.... I recollect that the latter was mightily becoming to you, sir..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you remember," [...] said Mara, [...] "one Saturday afternoon, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Sally <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{launched}} {{your little}} ship {{down in the}} cove after you had come from your first voyage at the Banks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you needn't {{laugh at}} a feller. You didn't {{know what a}} wombat was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> asked <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't roar," [...] said Ben, giving his hat a slap, as nothing else was handy.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that sense, perhaps, {{you may be}} right. And, now {{you mention}} it, I think it odd there should be so much {{industry}} at wood-chopping, in a moment like this. We will halt {{as soon as the}} sounds are fairly abreast of us, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can reconnoitre the men, and ascertain the appearance of things for ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Oswald," [...] Roger said, as {{they rode}} away, {{accompanied}} by twenty of Glendower's followers, under the orders of an officer; [...] "we have got out of that scrape better than could have been expected. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were alone, {{in the midst of}} that crowd of Welshmen, I thought that it was all over with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely we are Gods still," [...] {{said the}} Girl. [...] "Do you not {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{went to the}} House of the Crab and--were not very much afraid? And since then ... we have forgotten what we were singing for--we sang for the pence, and, oh, we fought for them!--We, who are the Children of the Zodiac!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] she {{answered}} frankly. [...] "I like you very much--I {{like the little}} crease about your eyes, which deepens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> laugh. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> like your mouth. But {{as a matter of}} fact, I'm rather in love with some one else, and I'm going to marry him soon. He's got quite enough money for me, although he can't carry the family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas {{very odd}} {{what we said}} to each other years ago; I often think of it. I mean our saying that if we still liked each other <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were twenty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> twenty-five, we'd--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, I don't {{believe in}} churches and parsons and all that," [...] she said, [...] "but I believe in God, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't believe He minds {{much about what}} you do as long as you keep your end up and help a lame dog over a stile <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think people on the whole are very nice, and I'm sorry for those who aren't." ...|$|R
