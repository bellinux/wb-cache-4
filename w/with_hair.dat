5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother <b>with</b> <b>hair.</b> Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered <b>with</b> <b>hair</b> and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{initially}} {{as young}} convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following {{his success in}} Thelma & Louise (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) {{when he went to}} audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton <b>with</b> <b>hair</b> as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered <b>with</b> <b>hair.</b> The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed <b>with</b> <b>hair,</b> teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience <b>with</b> <b>hair</b> and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E

5|$|The way Caracalla {{wanted to}} be portrayed to his people can be seen through the many {{surviving}} busts and coins. Images of the young Caracalla cannot be clearly distinguished from his younger brother Geta. On the coins, Caracalla was shown with laureate after becoming Augustus in 197 while Geta is bareheaded until he himself became Augustus in 209. Between 209 and their father's death in February211, both brothers are shown as mature young men who were ready {{to take over the}} empire. Between the death of the father and the assassination of Geta towards the end of 211, Caracalla's portrait remains static with a short full beard while Geta develops a long beard <b>with</b> <b>hair</b> strains like his father. The latter was a strong indicator of Geta's effort to be seen as the true successor to their father, an effort that came to naught when he was murdered. Caracalla's presentation on coins during the period of his co-reign with his father, from 198 to 210, are in broad terms in line with the third-century imperial representation; most coin types communicate military and religious messages, with other coins giving messages of saeculum aureum and virtues. During Caracalla's sole reign, from 212 to 217, a significant shift in representation took place. The majority of coins produced during this period made associations with divinity or had religious messages; others had non-specific and unique messages that were only circulated during Caracalla's sole rule.|$|E
