5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this <b>way</b> <b>we</b> come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E

They've been one of the most powerful forces for economic and social change wherever they've been adopted, changing the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> do business, the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> live out our daily lives, and probably the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> think. Like telephones, autos have the fantastic capability to shrink geographic distance, permitting people to maintain close contact with each other, even though they live miles apart...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 97 on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending February 16, 1974, and by February 26, had already sold 500,000 copies and was {{certified}} Gold.

It became Streisand's second number one and seventh top five album, with the other number-one being People (1964). The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were spent two weeks at the highest position before falling to number four on March 30. It continued dropping on the charts but managed {{to stay within the}} top 10 of the list for a total of six weeks.

5|$|ButterFly is {{the sixteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on October 1, 1974 by Columbia Records. After releasing The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were earlier in 1974, a collection predominantly consisting of previously released songs, Streisand recorded her first album of entirely new material in over three years. Recorded throughout 1974 and primarily a contemporary pop record, it also incorporates music from the reggae and R genres. All of the tracks on ButterFly are cover songs produced by Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters, originating from artists like Bob Marley, David Bowie, Evie Sands, and Graham Nash.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|On Canada's Top Albums/CDs chart {{conducted}} by RPM, the record debuted at number 71 {{during the week}} of March 2, 1974.

It spent its final week in Canada at number 72 for the week ending May 11, 1974, totaling nine weeks on the chart. The soundtrack also made an appearance on the Official Chart Company's UK Compilation Chart in March 2005, where it debuted and peaked at number four.|$|E

5|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Streisand's vocals {{and found the}} record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> Were topped the Billboard 200 in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
