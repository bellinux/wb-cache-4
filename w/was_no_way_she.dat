500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001 All Saints broke up, and Lewis later {{explained}} that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never {{in a million years}} have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over. And the way I was then, the state we'd got into then, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was getting that stupid jacket."

Considering that Arnaud Hallet has [...] "had over twenty years of her life, the best", Linda leaves him without a word to go and live with Pleydon. Once at his studio, she realizes that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> could stay with that ageing, sickly man whose love for her could never be more than platonic. On the following day, she returns to her husband without ever telling him about her intended betrayal.|$|R

60|$|Solution! Why I {{was bound}} west that night, {{and here was}} I being trapped into going east. It was a trap, and I hadn't the heart {{to tell her that}} it was all a miserable lie.

The clerk said that. SOC would be interested in hearing from you privately, perhaps with a view toward agreeing on a remedial approach if you are inclined to join TM on liability. SOC 2 ̆ 7 s view on the remedy is that only benefits tied in to post-Norris contributions should be affected. I told the clerk I would pass this information on...|$|R

Hysterical, she asks that if there is any way to prove that she didn't have a son with him to steal the land from him, would he ever love her again? He says yes, but that she isn't God, so there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way.</b> <b>She</b> promises that there is and Eben goes inside to get drunk.|$|R

Without Javi to stop them, Ivan and Pau decide to murder Anna, only for her to end up killing them by tricking them into believing that she is once again dead, then stabbing them both with scissors once their guards are lowered.|$|E

40|$|QUESTION: Is {{there any}} way to predict whether a drug taken by a mother is safe for a {{suckling}} baby, or is it just trial and error? One of my patients is receiving lithium for manic depression. She wishes to breastfeed, but clinically there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> can discontinue the drug. My sources say the drug is incompatible with breastfeeding. ANSWER: The amount of drug available to a baby through breastmilk is estimated as the percentage of maternal dose per kg ingested by the baby. Because infants' clearance rate of many drugs is slower than adults', however, the true level of the drug circulating in the infant's blood might be much higher. Because lithium can be measured in plasma, it is prudent to measure it in milk and to estimate the "baby dose. " If a baby shows any adverse effects, lithium levels should be measured in its blood...|$|R

The boyfriend is played by Clint Carleton, and the girlfriend is played by Daniella Evangelista. Daniella bursts into tears after reading a newspaper, and frantically packs a suitcase with clothes. Clint tries to stop her from leaving, but she brushes him off and runs out crying. As she leaves {{the house with the}} suitcase (echoing the lyrics [...] "I wish you'd ... unpack your suitcase"), we see Clint stepping in spilled milk without leaving any traces or footprints.

He is still chasing her, though, and almost catches up to her, but she runs a red light and a large truck smashes {{into the side of the}} Jeep.

This implies that he was actually ghost throughout the video, which is why he didn't leave tracks in the milk and why she couldn't see him in the mirror.|$|R
