500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes on what she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b> After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS!

500|$|The {{publishers}} {{required that}} Vachss follow certain rules, including prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex, and keeping {{a clear distinction}} between fiction and reality. For example, while Vachss <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> Thailand, he created a fictional country named Udon Khai which had many similarities with Thailand — though Udon Khai is described as being dominated by a lone kingpin who controls the country's one-industry economy based on sex tourism while Thailand's tourism economy, which includes sex tourism, is part of an economic development strategy enabled by international development agencies. Vachss deviated from Batman canon by having the Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennyworth, reveal to Bruce Wayne that his mother, Martha, was a sociologist who was secretly investigating a child pornography ring. In Vachss' novel, the Waynes were not the victims of a random crime; instead, Martha was targeted for assassination. One reviewer compared the characterization of Batman as [...] "the same brooding, handsome, rich character that Val Kilmer played [...] " [...] but with the [...] "gothic presence of the older Batman seen in 1940s movie serials".

And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them.

500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared.

It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter, however, that he conceived of the protagonists, the winged Alana and the horned Marko, two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. It was also {{at this point that}} the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged. Vaughan explains, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> parenthood, but I wanted to Trojan-horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story, to explore the overlap between artistic creation {{and the creation of a}} child." [...] Vaughan, who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series, Ex Machina, and who notes that the publication of Saga #1 coincided with the birth of his daughter, saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new child into the world, observing: ...|$|E
