For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture.... I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E

500|$|Loup {{was born}} December 19, 1987, in Raceland, Louisiana. His father and {{grandfather}} influenced his baseball interest the most when he was young, {{and he says that}} it was [...] "just all baseball all the time", with [...] "a little football". Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there. As a kid, I needed to be reminded of that sometimes." [...] His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. [...] "I jumped {{on the ice and}} rushed {{straight}} for their net. I had this strange feeling that I could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson. Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There was no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming off the ice in that situation" [...] Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.|$|E
500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Champion" [...] {{was written}} by Minaj, along with T-Minus, Nikhil S., Drake, Young Jeezy, and Nas, with {{production}} handled by T-Minus and Nikhil S., who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010). Minaj had wanted several artists {{to appear on the}} song, including fellow New York rapper Nas. She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song, saying [...] "He's always been so exclusive. He doesn't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that. They take pride in their craft." [...] Minaj told Vibe, [...] "I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him... We know how picky he is [...] He said 'I like the song, I'm a do it, you can wait 'til Monday and I got you' and he kept his word. He murked it, for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that <b>way...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> amazed." [...] After hearing the song, Nas agreed to be on the track, and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday. After collaborating, Nas said that he {{had fallen in love with}} the song: [...] "Nicki hit us up, I got love, so it was nothin'--I did the record....If I feel it, I can get on it. I heard the track. I felt it. I loved it." [...] Another artist Minaj wanted on [...] "Champion" [...] was long-time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill. [...] "I wanted to get her on 'Champion'... That would have been crazy, right? She was my fave. [...] Lauryn to me is the goddess. I'd love to meet her. I'm pretty sure she's heard me talk about her a billion times." [...] Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track, plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through.|$|E

The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> raising them, they could never be saved. They were doomed to perish in the fires of hell." [...] She told her jail psychiatrist that Satan influenced her children and made them more disobedient.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001 All Saints broke up, and Lewis later {{explained}} that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never {{in a million years}} have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident. But when that incident happened, it fired up so strong, it had to be over. And the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> then, the state we'd got into then, {{there was no way she}} was getting that stupid jacket." [...] The same year she won the Ivor Novello Award for best songwriting.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990 and 1991, the KLF also remixed tracks by Depeche Mode ("Policy of Truth"), the Moody Boys ("What Is Dub?"), and Pet Shop Boys ("So Hard" [...] {{from the}} Behaviour album, and [...] "It Must Be Obvious"). Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant {{described}} the process: [...] "When {{they did the}} remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ... I {{had to go and}} sing the vocals again, they did it in a different <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> impressed that Bill Drummond had written all the chords out and played it on an acoustic guitar, very thorough." ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{recording}} studio experience for McCready and Vedder. Regarding McCready, Cornell said, [...] "You almost kind of had to yell at him {{to get him to}} realize that in the five-and-a-half minute solo of 'Reach Down', that was his time and that he wasn't going to be stepping on anybody else." [...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about doing it, just instinctively".|$|E

2500|$|Jennings {{made the}} news in July 2006 when {{an article in the}} New York Post by Michael Starr criticized Jennings for what Starr {{perceived}} as lack of loyalty and gratitude on Jennings' part, citing an open letter to the producers of Jeopardy! and host Alex Trebek that Jennings wrote on his blog. Jennings responded on his blog by explaining that the blog entry was satirical in tone, saying, [...] " [...] knows there's no <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> genuinely calling for angry bees and ventriloquist's dummies {{to be added to the}} Jeopardy! format. It's a humor piece, and one which gets its laughs from the outrageous non sequiturs it proposes, not the ripeness of its target for criticism." [...] Jennings had already posted a more serious comment defending Trebek that remains on his website.|$|E
2500|$|Chesterton {{wrote the}} hymn O God of Earth and Altar which was printed in The Commonwealth and then {{included}} in the English Hymnal in 1906. Several lines of the hymn are sung {{in the beginning of}} the song Revelations by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden on their 1983 album Piece of Mind. Lead singer Bruce Dickinson in an interview stated [...] "I have a fondness for hymns. I love some of the ritual, the beautiful words, Jerusalem and there was another one, with words by G.K. Chesterton O God of Earth and Altar – very fire and brimstone: 'Bow down and hear our cry'. I used that for an Iron Maiden song, Revelations. In my strange and clumsy <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to say look it's all the same stuff." ...|$|E
