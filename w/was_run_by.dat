5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors.

In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel.
