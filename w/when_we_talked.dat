500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

I don't know 100% why she made this decision. She didn't tell me. All she said <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> was that she felt it was time for her to move on. The door is not closed. We've asked her to come back and have offered {{different}} ways for her to return. But I completely wish her well. There's no drama involved." ...|$|E
