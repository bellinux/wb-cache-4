Community gardens are mixed spaces where some practices can be called activist, and others not. All of the gardens struggle with the issues that many volunteer-based organizations face. All of the gardens were seen by participants as public spaces which can not be isolated from the larger community, whether it is the neighbours or various visitors. This suggests that community gardens in Vancouver can be places <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>practice</b> acts that would support the food sovereignty movement in Canada...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bioethics {{as a field}} {{related to}} the health system and health service {{delivery}} has grown {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century, mainly in North America. This is attributed, the author argues, to mainly three kinds of development that took place in the developed countries at a pace different than the developing countries. They are namely: development of the health system; moral development; and political development. Discussion This article discusses the factors that impede the development of the field of bioethics from an academic activity to a living field that is known and <b>practiced</b> by the <b>people</b> in the developing countries. They are quite many; however, the emphasis here is on role of the political structure in the developing countries and how it negatively affects the development of bioethics. It presents an argument that if bioethics is to grow within the system of health service, it should be accompanied by a parallel changes in the political mindsets in these countries. Summary For bioethics to flourish in developing countries, it needs an atmosphere of freedom <b>where</b> <b>people</b> can <b>practice</b> free moral reasoning and have full potential to take their life decisions by themselves. Moreover, bioethics could be a tool for political change through the empowerment of people, especially the vulnerable. To achieve that, the article is proposing a practical framework for facilitating the development of the field of bioethics in the developing countries. </p...|$|R

To precisely clarify the relationship between land use and the natural habitat, the local ecosystems near a village in eastern Lesotho were examined in detail for 6 months. Temperature, soil and landform surveys were conducted. The characteristic landscape of the site was a terrace formation at about 2, 500 m above sea level. Settlements were located horizontally along the 2, 600 m contour line, separating the steep slope of the mountain and the gentle slope of the terrace. Three distinct land use patterns, each with unique environmental characteristics, were identified: cultivated fields, pastures, and settlements. In cultivated fields, the types of crops cultivated and the average temperature differed according to location. Pasture areas had the most extreme maximum and minimum temperatures, and minimal soil depths. Settlements were located above a cold-air lake that formed nightly, and here the diurnal range of temperatures was the least, indicating relative comfort in these areas...|$|R
