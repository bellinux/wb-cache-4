500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him...</b> On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, during {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the band's third studio album Whammy!, Wilson discovered he had contracted AIDS. He confided his illness to Keith Strickland, {{as stated in}} several interviews including one with The Age. In 1985, during recording for their album Bouncing Off the Satellites, Wilson's illness became more severe; both Strickland and Pierson have stated that despite this, he kept his illness secret from {{the other members of}} the band.

2500|$|In late August, {{following}} the failed August Offensive, {{he was sent}} to Gallipoli on the steamer HMT Southland, {{to take part in the}} fighting against the Turks, which had by that time developed into a bloody stalemate. En route, Southland was torpedoed by a German submarine off the island of Lemnos and Martin was rescued after spending four hours in the water. After being picked up, he rejoined his battalion at Mudros Island where they were transferred to the transport ship Abassieh on 7 September to resume their voyage to Gallipoli. The following morning, just before 2:00am, Martin's platoon, 4 Platoon, landed at Watson's Pier in Anzac Cove. He then served in trenches around Courtney's Post, which was positioned on the ridge overlooking Monash Valley. During this time he wrote to his family telling them that [...] "the Turks are still about [...] away from us" [...] and asked them not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as [...] "I am doing splendid over here". Throughout his time in Gallipoli, although his family were writing to him, Martin did not receive any letters from home due to a breakdown in the mail system.|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2016, DJ Khaled {{released}} his ninth studio album, Major Key. Cole is {{featured on the}} track [...] "Jermaine's Interlude". [...] "Said all I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement" [...] is a direct quote from the track that caused some of Cole's fans to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> and his music career. In an interview with Genius, Doctur Dot of the Atlanta duo EarthGang explained that the song was originally a nine-minute posse cut, he said, “We {{were just trying to}} get Bas to fuck with the song, but Cole was like, ‘I can’t resist this beat,’ so he hit the weed {{for the first time in}} a long time." [...] “He overthinks on weed but we were in the garage smoking a blunt, the beat was running in the background. We stacked the hook up, we all had verses on it, it was a posse record and was like, nine verses long.” On November 4, 2016, Cole performed at Jay Z and Beyoncé's Hillary Clinton Rally in Cleveland, Ohio, along with Big Sean and Chance the Rapper. On November 8, 2016, Spillage Village released the official version of [...] "Jermaine's Interlude", called [...] "Can't Call It". The song features Cole, EarthGang, Bas and J.I.D.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{principles}} that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. Noah, Moses, and Jesus). One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: [...] "Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>Him.</b> [...] If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you." [...] Nonetheless, the [...] "interpretation of this point – that Grace claimed he himself was God – has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and {{only a handful of}} writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside." [...] The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context." [...] The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not [...] "God himself", but merely an [...] "intermediary" [...] and [...] "the path to salvation." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the recording, guitarist Ricky Wilson {{had been}} {{suffering}} from AIDS. None of the other band members other than Strickland were aware of his illness. Strickland later stated that Wilson [...] "was very protective of Cindy and his family." [...] In an interview, Kate Pierson stated that Wilson had kept his illness secret from his bandmates because he [...] "did not want anyone to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> or fuss about him." [...] Because of this {{and the lack of}} new material for the album, Wilson and Strickland allowed Pierson and Fred Schneider to contribute solo material they had been working on at the time; they contributed one track each for the album, [...] "Housework" [...] and [...] "Juicy Jungle", respectively. On October 12, 1985, Wilson finally succumbed to the illness, at the age of 32, and though Strickland and a few session musicians worked on overdubs for the recorded tracks, the rest of the band were not involved. Devastated at Wilson's death, the band went into seclusion and did not tour to promote the album. Nevertheless, Bouncing Off the Satellites eventually reached 85 on the Billboard 200. Cindy went into a deep depression after her brother's death, while Strickland retreated to Woodstock, New York, and Pierson and Schneider stayed in New York City. The band initially felt that {{it would be impossible to}} continue without Ricky until they reformed in 1988 for the recording of their next album Cosmic Thing.|$|E
