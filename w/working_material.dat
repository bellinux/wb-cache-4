25|$|It is {{important}} to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the <b>working</b> <b>material,</b> thus while a material may store 6 wt% H2, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.|$|E
25|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a <b>working</b> <b>material</b> that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer.|$|E
50|$|Iso{{magnetic}} entropic transfer: The {{magnetic field}} is held constant {{to prevent the}} material from reheating. The material is placed in thermal contact with the environment to be refrigerated. Because the <b>working</b> <b>material</b> is cooler than the refrigerated environment (by design), heat energy migrates into the <b>working</b> <b>material</b> (+Q).|$|E
50|$|Jig borers {{are limited}} to <b>working</b> <b>materials</b> that are still soft enough to be bored. Often a jig is hardened; for a jig borer this {{requires}} the material to be bored first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. The jig grinder was developed as a machine with the precision of the jig borer, but capable of <b>working</b> <b>materials</b> in their hardened state.|$|R

50|$|Melt is the <b>working</b> <b>material</b> in the {{steelmaking}} process, {{in making}} glass, and when forming thermoplastics. In thermoplastics, melt is the plastic in its forming temperature, which can {{vary depending on}} how it is being used. For steelmaking, it refers to steel in liquid form.|$|E

50|$|The Preliminary assizes of 1966 {{were the}} first meeting of the Estates General of French Canada. The assizes, held from November 25 to 27 at Université de Montréal, were said to be {{preliminary}} because their objective was to prepare the <b>working</b> <b>material</b> on the basis of which the subsequent assizes were to debate.|$|E
50|$|Lubricants {{are used}} to reduce {{friction}} between the <b>working</b> <b>material</b> and the punch and die. They also aid in removing the part from the punch. Some examples of lubricants used in drawing operations are heavy-duty emulsions, phosphates, white lead, and wax films. Plastic films covering {{both sides of the}} part while used with a lubricant will leave the part with a fine surface.|$|E

50|$|Thermodynamic scale {{differs from}} {{empirical}} scales {{in that it}} is absolute. It is based on the fundamental laws of thermodynamics or statistical mechanics instead of some arbitrary chosen <b>working</b> <b>material.</b> Besides it covers full range of temperature and has simple relation with microscopic quantities like the average kinetic energy of particles (see equipartition theorem). In experiments ITS-90 is used to approximate thermodynamic scale due to simpler realization.|$|E

50|$|The {{cycle is}} {{performed}} as a refrigeration cycle that {{is analogous to}} the Carnot refrigeration cycle, but with increases and decreases in magnetic field strength instead of increases and decreases in pressure. It can be described at a starting point whereby the chosen working substance is introduced into a magnetic field, i.e., the magnetic flux density is increased. The <b>working</b> <b>material</b> is the refrigerant, and starts in thermal equilibrium with the refrigerated environment.|$|E

50|$|Josephsohn's {{favourite}} <b>working</b> <b>material</b> was plaster. He {{found it}} ideal - simply it permits directness and spontaneity, {{both of which}} were necessary for Josephsohn's working process. Plaster allowed him to repeatedly add material or take it away. The directness of the work process was reflected not only in the immense vitality of the figures but even more by the traces left by this process. For example, finger imprints remain on the surface, referencing the artist's hands as it seeks to mold the material.|$|E

50|$|Bone tools {{have been}} {{documented}} from the advent of Homo sapiens and are also known from Homo neanderthalensis contexts or even earlier. Bone {{has been used for}} making tools by virtually all hunter-gatherer societies, even when other materials were readily available. Any part of the skeleton can potentially be utilized; however, antlers and long bones provide some of the best <b>working</b> <b>material.</b> Long bone fragments can be shaped, by scraping against an abrasive stone, into such items as arrow and spear points, needles, awls, and fish hooks.|$|E
5000|$|Curves artistic {{direction}} {{was inspired}} by the bands 2010 Clumsy and Spiritual Machines tour, as well as by constructive criticism from a friend of the bands, Jason Lader, who later became producer of the album. When Lader was shown some early <b>working</b> <b>material</b> from the album, he criticized it, saying [...] "why dont you make a record that you would listen to?". This prompted the band to scrap all of the material theyd written and recorded up to that point, and to start over fresh.|$|E
50|$|Using {{reclaimed}} plastic household {{objects as}} her materials, Ganz' recent sculptures depict animals in motion. Ganz collects {{most of her}} <b>working</b> <b>material</b> from dustbins and charity shops, {{and the rest is}} donated by friends and family. Ganz uses various forms of thrown away plastic, from cutlery to sunglasses and baskets, and sorts them into many different colour groups. Then she ties every piece of plastic to a wire armature, until she achieves the shape she first envisioned. Sayaka Ganz’s works range from 18 inches to 8 feet long and the most complicated ones take up to a month to finish and can contain hundreds of pieces.|$|E
