5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E

5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E

25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of katana amongst samurai came about {{due to the}} changing nature of close-combat warfare. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only were}} the peace terms {{probably}} offered by the Frisians to the Danes, but the Frisians were very submissive in the deal.

The defenders are also to be given half of a new building, which, confusingly they are to share with Finn and the eotena sons (see below), and also to be given feasts and treasure by Finn.

The Beowulf poet describes how Finn stuck to his oath by giving treasure.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E
500|$|Tubes {{comprising}} the hymenophore {{on the underside}} of the cap are [...] deep, with an attachment to the stipe ranging from adnate to somewhat decurrent. The pores are tiny, numbering 3 per mm in young specimens and 1–2 per mm in maturity. The stipe is [...] tall and [...] wide. It is pale yellow and more or less cylindrical but may bear a swollen base. [...] A membranous partial veil initially links the stipe <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cap. When it ruptures, it forms a membranous, hanging ring. The top side of the ring is whitish, while the underside is characteristically dark brown to violet. This species is one of the few members of the genus Suillus that have such a ring. Above the ring, the stipe features glandular dots—minute clumps of pigmented cells. Below the ring, the stipe is dingy white, sometimes streaked with brownish slime. In humid conditions, the ring has a gelatinous texture. The white flesh of the entire fungus does not discolour when damaged, and is soft—particularly in mature specimens. It has a [...] "pleasant" [...] taste and lacks any distinctive odour.|$|E

500|$|When Roebling {{was called}} to the Niagara Suspension Bridge project in 1851, he had six {{suspension}} structures to his name. [...] He found Ellet's final plan to be impractical; the bridge {{would have been too}} heavy and expensive. [...] Roebling had another design in mind: the double-deck bridge he had proposed earlier during the bidding. [...] The lower deck, level <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the chasm, would convey passengers and carriages, and the upper deck, [...] above, would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non-stop, albeit at a speed of [...] [...] Roebling reasoned that the decks and sufficient trusses would form a rigid tube, making the bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge. [...] The theory was {{similar to that of the}} tubular bridge but implemented at a lower cost. [...] The engineering community was critical of Roebling's project. [...] Robert Stephenson, builder of the tubular Britannia Bridge, was among those short-listed to complete the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling's selection. [...] Stephenson had submitted a design for a tubular bridge, and in 1859 he built a large and expensive tubular bridge for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal, Quebec. [...] The bridge builder then said in derision of Roebling's suspension railway, [...] "If your bridge succeeds, mine is a magnificent blunder." ...|$|E

He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle. Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' [...] "conversion to philosophy": [...] "in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training. Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.|$|E

2500|$|The white wand (or slat bhan) is also {{significant}} in the Gaelic/Brehon tradition of the inauguration of ancient Irish Kings. [...] This is keenly observed in the inauguration of the O’Donnell, Prince of Tyrconnell. [...] The significance of the white wand was described by Geoffrey Keating: It was the chronicler’s function to place a wand in the hand of each lord [...] on his inauguration; and on presenting the wand he made it known to the populace that the lord or king need not take up arms thenceforth to keep his country in subjection, but that they should obey his wand as a scholar obeys his master. For, as the wise scholar obeys and is grateful to his master, {{in the same way}} subjects are bound to their kings, for it is with the wand of equity and justice he directs his subjects, and not <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the weapon of injustice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{episode was}} not broadcast until 26 August 1991, when the BBC aired a version that edited together {{the first half}} of the taping with one of the two completed second halves. As it happened, the version chosen was the one in which the TARDIS doors would not close; other errors included actress Carole Ann Ford fluffing a line of dialogue, Jacqueline Hill getting caught in a doorway, a camera banging into a piece of scenery during one of the scrapyard sequences, and William Russell accidentally knocking over a mannequin in the scrapyard. Earlier, in June 1991, a version with the first half edited together with the other take of the second half of the pilot was released on the VHS compilation The Hartnell Years; later, in 2000, the complete version (including both takes) was released in a remastered form on VHS, along <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> Destruction. In 2006, the Doctor Who: The Beginning DVD set contained two versions of the episode: an unedited studio recording including all takes of the second part of the show, and a newly created version of the pilot that uses the best footage from the original recording, with additional editing and digital adjustments to remove blown lines, technical problems, and reduce studio noise. Like the other episodes from this serial, both versions of the [...] "pilot" [...] were remastered for DVD release, using VidFIRE technology that simulated the original video look of the 1963 production.|$|E

2500|$|So it was, on {{the next}} morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The {{children}} of Israel said, [...] "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did {{not come up with}} the assembly to the Lord?" [...] For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, [...] "He shall surely be put to death." [...] And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, [...] "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?" [...] And they said, [...] "What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?" [...] And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, [...] "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the sword, including the women and children. And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately." [...] So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Youzhny {{started the}} 2008 season by {{defeating}} world number two Rafael Nadal in under {{an hour at}} {{the final of the}} Chennai Open in India. However, the scoreline did not reflect the circumstances, Nadal's semi-final finished mere hours beforehand and he had little rest. Youzhny admitted as much, and said; [...] "This victory is a present from Rafael", but Nadal responded by saying [...] "I was a bit tired, but I must admit Mikhail played unbelievable tennis and deserved to win. There is nothing wrong with me." [...] As the 14th-seed at the Australian Open Youzhny reached his first quarterfinals there by defeating world number four Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets. However, in the quarterfinals he lost to unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, ranked world number thirty-eight and the eventual runner-up, in three sets. At the Open 13 in Marseille, France, Youzhny reached the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets to world number seventeen Marcos Baghdatis. At the Miami Masters, Youzhny was 4–5 down with Spain's Nicolás Almagro serving in the final set, he hit a relatively easy return into the net. He gestured angrily towards his own temple, and then hit his head strongly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> frame of his tennis racket three times, drawing blood. Despite this—and after receiving medical attention—he won the next seven points, taking the tiebreaker and also the match. In his next match, he lost to Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic. His bad form continued into the clay season, but Youzhny, as the 15th-seed, managed to reach the third round of the French Open, losing to world number twenty-three Fernando Verdasco from Spain in four sets. At Wimbledon Youzhny was seeded 17th, and reached the fourth round by defeating 16th-seed Radek Štěpánek in a five-setter in the third round. He lost to 2nd-seed and eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. At his next tournament, the Allianz Suisse Open Gstaad in Switzerland, Youzhny reached his last quarterfinals of the season and lost to Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. At the Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Youzhny lost in the third round to world number three Novak Djokovic. Youzhny withdrew from the US Open due to viral illness, making his first withdrawal from a grand slam after appearing in 23 in a row. Youzhny continued his poor results, reaching the first and second round in all the remaining tournaments, with one exception in Tokyo, Japan. He ended the year with a 28–22 win-loss record, and with an end of year ranking of 33.|$|E
