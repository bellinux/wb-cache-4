It's the spirit of who I am, as a man, an actor, a father. It's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> from." [...] Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused.

Chopra said that the song was not inspired by one city, since her father was an army doctor, and her family travelled all over India to cities like Jamshedpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Pune, Bareily, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Ladakh. Chopra told the Hindustan Times that the song was [...] "about being proud of <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> from. It's inviting the world to my city and my city could be anywhere." [...] The song pays homage to her nomadic childhood and her journey from being a small-town girl to being a successful actor.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} saw Maurice Hurley being {{promoted}} to head writer after {{the departure of}} Robert Lewin. Hurley had been brought on board during the first season. His prior experience had been with shows such as The Equalizer and Miami Vice, and he later explained that he took the position because it challenged him. The 1988 Writers Guild of America strike had caused problems {{at the end of}} the first season, and these continued as the development of season two started, resulting in a shortened season. Executive producer Rick Berman blamed a decrease in quality at the start of season two on the lack of time available for proper development due to the writer's strike. Hurley felt that the writing on the show managed to get into a rhythm during the second half of the first season, and that the strike stopped that and resulted in his eventually leaving the series. He also criticised the lack of character arcs in the series, saying that [...] "I did some good, some bad, some mediocre, but it's not a show that I could continue to do. It's not <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> from." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex {{received}} mixed to favourable reviews, {{with some}} critics criticizing {{the game for}} making little changes to the formula established by its predecessors. Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would be a fool not {{to go out and}} buy this game. I started playing at 2am one night and did not stop until three in the afternoon!" [...] Doug Perry of IGN described the game as [...] "a decent-playing and pretty-looking Crash Bandicoot game. It's nothing terribly special, but it's not bad, not bad at all." [...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro cautioned that [...] "if you were hoping the new management would give Crash a big kick in the pants, however, this is one pair of pants you will find quite unkicked."

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
