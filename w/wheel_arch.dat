2500|$|As with {{previous}} generation models the XC70 features increased ground clearance, optional all-wheel-drive and some cosmetic differences {{from the normal}} V70. On the outside there are XC-only front and rear bumpers, side skirts, <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> extensions and additional exterior door trims all in unpainted black plastic. The optional roof rails feature an embossed [...] "XC" [...] and are only available in black. Various unique alloy wheels are offered only for the XC.|$|E
2500|$|Chevrolet {{released}} the Grand Sport (GS) version in 1996 {{to mark the}} end of production of the C4 Corvette. The Grand Sport moniker was a nod to the original Grand Sport model produced in 1963. A total of 1,000 GS Corvettes were produced, 810 as coupes and 190 as convertibles.

2500|$|The first-generation Toronado lasted {{with the}} usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the {{replacement}} of the original [...] V8 with the new [...] in 1968 that was rated at [...] in standard form or [...] with the W-34 option, revised rear quarter panels (with small fins to disguise the slope of the rear body in side view) in 1969, and the disappearance of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> bulges in 1970. An ignition lock became standard in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Superficially {{there is}} little to {{distinguish}} the post-1983 vehicles from the Series III Land Rover. A full-length bonnet, revised grille, plus the fitting of <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> extensions to cover wider-track axles are the most noticeable changes. Initially the conservative engineering department insisted that the Land Rover was also available with a part-time 4WD system familiar to derivatives produced since 1949. However the part-time system failed to sell and was quickly dropped from the options list by 1984. While the engine and other body panels carried over from the Series III, mechanically the 90 and 110 were modernized, including: ...|$|E

50|$|The main {{aesthetic}} {{difference between}} the GTI/CTi versions and other 205 models were the plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and trim, beefier front and rear bumper valances. The shell also underwent some minor changes, including larger <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> (to suit the larger wheels on the GTI and CTi), and the suspension was redesigned and sat lower on the GTI with stiffer springs, different wishbones and a drop-linked anti-roll bar.|$|R

2500|$|Plaxtons built {{a number}} of {{different}} coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping severally {{from the bottom of the}} front <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> to the roofline, leaving the [...] "bullnose" [...] radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, a new LP400 S {{model was}} introduced. Though {{the engine was}} {{slightly}} downgraded from the LP400 model (...) , the most radical changes were in the exterior, where the tires were replaced with 345/35R15 Pirelli P7 tyres; the widest tyres available on a production car at the time, and fiberglass <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> extensions were added, giving the car the fundamental look it kept {{until the end of}} its production run. An optional V-shaped spoiler was available over the rear deck, which, while improving high-speed stability, reduced the top speed by at least [...] Most owners ordered the wing. The LP400 S handling was improved by the wider tires, which made the car more stable in cornering. Aesthetically, some prefer the slick lines of the original, while others prefer the more aggressive lines of the later models, beginning with the LP400 S. The standard emblems ("Lamborghini" [...] and [...] "Countach") were kept at the rear, but an angular [...] "S" [...] emblem was added after the [...] "Countach" [...] on the right side.|$|E
2500|$|Land Rover South Africa {{also built}} 26 50th Anniversary edition 90s {{featuring}} the BMW M52 engine. The vehicles were painted Santorini Blue with special decal graphics on the sides. They also featured [...] "colour-coded <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> mouldings, spot lamps, spare wheel carrier, free style alloy wheels, stainless steel A-frame Bullbar, two-tone solid paint, Willards welding and side runners" [...] {{as well as}} [...] "leather seats, radio and CD player, leather steering wheel and gear lever {{as well as a}} cooler box." [...] Each were randomly numbered between 1 and 50, as 24 50th Anniversary edition 110s were also built, but with a diesel engine. The special 110 was called [...] "Safari" [...] and was painted in a limestone green colour. It featured everything included on the 50th Anniversary 90 with addition of [...] "a roof rack and step ladder, as well as a wrap-around Bullbar in place of the A-frame" [...] and [...] "special cloth seats are used in favour of the leather ones. It is also fitted with a GPS (Pathfinder system)." ...|$|E

After selling about 500 vehicles, primarily in France, Norway and the UK, at a price of about €25,000, the Elect'road was redesigned in 2007.|$|E

50|$|After scrutineering at Bathurst in 1987, {{there had}} been rumours about the {{legality}} of the Eggenberger built Sierra's, specifically to do with oversized <b>wheel</b> <b>arches.</b> On the Thursday before qualifying an official protest was lodged against the Sierra's, which was held over {{due to the lack of}} a road going RS500 in Australia to compare them with. Eventually, after nearly four months and an eventual disqualification and later appeal by Eggenberger, the two Sierras were disqualified for having oversize <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> allowing them to fit larger wheels, giving McLeod, Brock and Parsons the race win.|$|R

50|$|A 2+2 {{has just}} two rear seats {{rather than the}} more common three. Reasons for this may include a car's more sporty nature, typical low roof line, wide <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> and (because of being front engined with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive) wide central {{transmission}} tunnels, the last of these being the most pressing problem for a third (middle) seat. For example, the Porsche 911 is a rear engined, rear wheel drive, so it lacks a large transmission tunnel, but loses space in the rear due to its <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> reducing the space to 2 passengers.|$|R
