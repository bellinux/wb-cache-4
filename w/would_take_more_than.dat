5|$|The {{first months}} of Bradbury's {{directorship}} were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It {{soon became clear that}} this <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.|$|E
25|$|However, as the {{specimen}} had been stuffed, the gills and skeleton {{were not available}} for examination, and some doubt therefore remained {{as to whether it}} was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proposed}} interval between successive pageloads was 60 seconds. However, if pages were downloaded {{at this rate}} from a website with more than 100,000 pages over a perfect connection with zero latency and infinite bandwidth, it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2 months to download only that entire Web site; also, {{only a fraction of}} the resources from that Web server would be used. This does not seem acceptable.|$|E

25|$|The {{week before}} he left for Mexico, Weston briefly reunited with Mather and took several nudes of her lying in the sand at Redondo Beach. These images were very {{different}} from his previous nude studies - sharply focused and showing her entire body in relation to the natural setting. They have been called the artistic prototypes for his most famous nudes, those of Charis Wilson which he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade later.|$|E
25|$|The mid 19th century {{brought a}} {{succession}} of calamities that crippled the South African wine industry. In 1859 oidium first appeared and quickly spread through the Cape. This {{was followed by a}} series of agreements made in 1860s (most notably the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty) between the Gladstone government and France that reduced the preferential tariffs which had benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports. In 1866, the phylloxera epidemic reached the Cape, causing widespread devastation that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 years to recover from.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{was clear}} that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one battle (28 December 1915, 1 January 1916) to defeat Germany, but like many British generals he {{overestimated}} the chances of success on the Somme, noting that Britain had more ammunition and big guns than before, that by attacking on a wide front of 20 miles or so, the attackers would not be subjected to enfilade German artillery fire (in the event this probably spread the artillery too thin, contributing to the disaster of 1 July) and that attrition would work in the Allies’ favour as “the Germans are approaching the limit of their resources”.|$|E
50|$|Chief Engineer Scott {{eventually}} regains {{control of}} Engineering from Riley, but Riley had already {{shut down the}} engines. It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> time <b>than</b> the ship has in its decaying orbit to restart them before the Enterprise crashes into the planet.|$|R

50|$|All this in {{less than}} two months whereas it <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,170 years to achieve with a single {{computer}}. Each computer contributed about 133 hours, or <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 million hours of calculations in total. Twenty-one IBM servers coordinated the solutions and data throughout the operation.|$|R
25|$|On 28 October 2011, the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission {{presented}} a timetable in a draft report titled, “how to scrap the Fukushima reactors”. Within 10 years, a start {{should be made}} with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also. After the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, some 70 percent of the fuel rods had melted. There, the retrieval of the fuel was started in 1985, and completed in 1990. The work at Fukushima was expected to take significantly longer because of the far greater damage {{and the fact that}} 4 reactors would need to be decommissioned all at the same time.|$|E
25|$|All the city's {{buildings}} {{were made of}} wood, and fire was a great risk. In 1328 nearly the whole city burnt down. The Sint-Bavokerk was severely damaged, and rebuilding it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 150 years. Again on 12 June 1347 {{there was a fire}} in the city. A third large fire, in 1351, destroyed many buildings including the Count's castle and the city hall. The Count did not need a castle in Haarlem because his castle in Den Haag had taken over all functions. The Count donated the ground to the city and later a new city hall was built there. The shape of the old city was square—this was inspired by the shape of ancient Jerusalem. After every fire the city was rebuilt quickly, an indication of the wealth of the city in those years. The Black Death came to the city in 1381. According to an estimate by a priest from Leiden the disease killed 5,000 people, about half the population at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{fighting}} had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged {{on the night of}} July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Former Vice President of Syria Abdel-Halim Khaddam, in an {{interview}} with the Lebanese Future Television on 27 August 2006, said: [...] "Saying that the farms are occupied, and hence cannot be demarcated, is nothing but a pretext. The demarcation <b>would</b> not <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an hour if there was a political will." ...|$|R
50|$|The library's 122500 sq ft {{footprint}} <b>would</b> <b>take</b> up <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half a city block, {{and twenty}} buildings were cleared for its construction, {{many of them}} private homes. Although excavation began {{in the fall of}} 1927, the construction site was not fully secured until July 1928, when a holdout homeowner finally decamped.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish invaders, {{after the}} conquest of Tenochtitlan, never {{imagined}} that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> them <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two centuries to conquer northern Mexico, a region known as Aridoamerica. Several Chichimeca (uncivil and dirty dog) groups inhabited the regions. This name was given because of the thought {{that they had a}} lower cultural level, compared to other native cultures of Mesoamerica.|$|R
500|$|Cyan Worlds began {{development}} on its next project {{after the company}} finished 1997's Riven, the sequel to the bestselling Myst. The game that became Uru <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five years and $12 million to complete. While under development, Uru was codenamed DIRT ("D'ni in real time"), then MUDPIE (for [...] "Multi-User DIRT, Persistent / Personal Interactive Entertainment / Experience / Exploration / Environment"). Uru was officially announced as Myst Online, before being renamed Uru in early 2003. Myst co-creator Rand Miller released a statement along with an outline of the game: ...|$|E
500|$|The Army Corps {{estimated}} that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $20million to repair just the major breaches along the middle breakwater. [...] On September18 Connolly-Pacific Co. was contracted for $5m {{to repair the}} twelve worst affected areas of the breakwaters and construction began on October8. An estimated 20,000–30,000tons of rock would {{be used in the}} project. A $200,000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around Navy Mole, including Pier F, J South, and Navy Mole Road; this was later increased to $4million by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in January 2015.|$|E
500|$|Although {{several key}} {{elements}} of Evans's designs—such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws—were merely modified rather than invented by him, the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution {{and the development of}} mass production. Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line. His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time, and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a century to be fully realized. However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans's milling designs, first to related industries such as brewing and baking, then eventually {{to a wide variety of}} products, as technology and prevailing opinion caught up. Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect, Evans [...] "opens a new chapter in the history of mankind".|$|E
5000|$|In an October 1, 2012, {{interview}} on Good Morning America, Schwarzenegger {{revealed that he}} had had difficulty pronouncing the word I'll and asked director James Cameron if it could be changed to [...] "I will be back". Cameron refused but told him that the shot <b>would</b> be <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once and the best would be used in the final cut of the film so Schwarzenegger could vary the line.|$|R

Finally, on April 27, 1964, the court {{ruled in favor of}} the City of Richmond, but it only awarded the city [...] of the [...] that it had requested. The City of Richmond then declined to accept and pay for the land that was awarded in the annexation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{savings that}} could be made with this {{technology}} were considerable. [...] A worker spinning cotton at a hand-powered spinning wheel in the 18th century <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50,000 hours to spin 100lb of cotton; by the 1790s, the same quantity could be spun in 300 hours by mule, and with a self-acting mule it could be spun by one worker in just 135 hours.|$|E
50|$|Having {{determined}} that Rhamphorhynchus specimens fit into discrete year-classes, Bennett {{was able to}} estimate the growth rate during one year by comparing the size of one-year-old specimens with two-year-old specimens. He found that the average growth rate {{during the first year}} of life for Rhamphorhynchus was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate in alligators. Growth likely slowed considerably after sexual maturity, so it <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> three years to attain maximum adult size.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{found himself}} with {{eighteen}} shillings {{left out of}} his month's pay. It was the first money he had ever earned in his life. It gave him none of the pride {{which might have been}} expected, but merely a feeling of dismay. The smallness of the sum emphasised the hopelessness of his position. He took fifteen shillings to Mrs. Athelny to pay back part of what he owed her, but she <b>would</b> not <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half a sovereign.|$|R

Altham {{wrote in}} 1940 about {{a visit to}} Lord's in December 1939 as [...] "a sobering experience; there were sandbags {{everywhere}} and the Long Room was stripped bare with its treasures safely stored below ground". [...] Having painted a bleak picture thus far, Altham ended on a note of defiance: [...] "but the turf was a wondrous green, Old Father Time on the Grand Stand roof was gazing serenely at the nearest (barrage) balloon and one felt that somehow it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> totalitarian war {{to put an end}} to cricket".|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was [...] "a crazy woman"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{a small portion of}} public park land; and proclaiming the project as a [...] "fine and magnificent work of architecture" [...] opposed by only the [...] "ignorant few." [...] On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members [...] "a bunch of divorcees". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte {{admitted}} in December 2016 {{that he had}} been a user of the addictive opioid drug Fentanyl. He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he was prescribed: [...] "I was only given a fourth of , but no more, because of course my doctor learned that I was using the whole patch because I felt better". Fentanyl is described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse as [...] "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent". Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations.|$|E
60|$|It {{was true}} that veteran members of the firm, looking in the glass, found white hairs where no white hairs had been and {{wrinkles}} on foreheads which, under the solid rule of old John Bannister, had been smooth; but it <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> these straws to convince Bailey that the wind which was blowing was an ill-wind. He had developed in a day the sublime self-confidence of a young Napoleon. He was all dash and enterprise--the hurricane fighter of Wall Street.|$|R
