25|$|The Norman Hauteville family, {{who were}} {{descendants}} of Vikings, came to appreciate and admire {{the rich and}} layered culture in which they now found themselves. And they began implementing their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily also adopted some of the attributes of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, {{and even in the}} presence of palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem. The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued {{in the language of the}} community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, still with heavy Arab and Greek influence. The governance was by the rule of law, so there was justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together to form a society that historians have said created some of the most extraordinary buildings that the <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen.|$|E

According to Collins, the primary reason for developing the competition was that he [...] "loved the idea of thousands of {{people from all over the}} world connecting to create incredible things". He hoped to use GISHWHES to encourage participants [...] "to do good in the world". The inaugural event, categorized by Guinness World Records as a [...] "media scavenger hunt", broke the record for the largest scavenger hunt of its kind. In 2012, it broke its own record with 14,580 participants, representing 69 different countries. The contest broke two additional world records in 2013: the longest safety pin chain, measuring , and the largest online photo album of hugs, totaling 108,121 images.|$|E

He was reinstated in 1895, but by this time his rugby career was over. Despite having never played for New Zealand, his reputation was such that in 1917, when discussing the declining standards of New Zealand rugby's back-play, an anonymous former representative player wrote that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods." [...] Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness.

500|$|Minneapolis {{developed}} around Saint Anthony Falls, {{the highest}} waterfall on the Mississippi River {{and a source}} of power for its early industry. Forests in northern Minnesota were a valuable resource for the lumber industry, which operated seventeen sawmills on power from the waterfall. By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses, including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood. Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the prosthetics business by the 1890s. The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city's thirty-four flour mills. Millers have used hydropower elsewhere since the 1st century B.C., but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as [...] "the greatest direct-drive waterpower center the <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen." ...|$|E

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the <b>world</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition.

[...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Friedrich Meinecke {{described}} Hitler as [...] "one of {{the great}} examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life".

For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler's defeat {{marked the end of}} a phase of European history dominated by Germany. In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union. Historian Sebastian Haffner avers that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist. He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed. Further, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.|$|E
