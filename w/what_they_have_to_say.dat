500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Section 5 {{is based}} on Article 9 of the United Kingdom's Bill of Rights 1689: [...] "he [...] of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in [...] {{ought not to be}} impeached or {{questioned}} in any Court or Place out of [...]" [...] On the basis of this provision, and for other reasons, a long line of authorities in the Commonwealth have held that courts are precluded from impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament. This is so even if the legal action is brought by, and not against, a member of the legislature. Immunity also extends to independent persons appointed by Parliament exercising their duties in relation to Parliament's activities. In Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd. (1994), the Privy Council held that if any exceptions were made unless in the most extreme circumstances, members of the legislature would not know if there would subsequently be challenges to what they are saying in Parliament. Therefore, members would not have the confidence to state fully and freely <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

When Moore asked Manson {{what he would}} have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them.

2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and that's what no one did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier in 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} {{a cover of}} Gloria Jones' [...] "Tainted Love" [...] on the soundtrack to Not Another Teen Movie.

In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled [...] "Redeemer", which was released on his [...] to Queen of the Damned. Manson also appeared in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed {{on the same day}} as their Denver Ozzfest performance.

2500|$|On 16 August 1819 a {{crowd had}} {{assembled}} near Manchester {{to listen to}} a speech by Henry Hunt and was run down by the yeomanry cavalry, with fifteen dead as a result. Fitzwilliam's first reaction to [...] "Peterloo" [...] was cautious. He wrote on 24 August: [...] "I see they are making much of what has happened in Manchester, in London. No doubt much may be said against interfering with a legal meeting...but circumstances may arise to call for the intervention of the magistrates even on such occasions, and to be impartial, one must hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for themselves". On 5 October Fitzwilliam wrote to Lady Ponsonby: [...] "If we do not set this matter to rights, the military are henceforward the governing power in the British Empire". At the county meeting of Yorkshire held on 14 October, Fitzwilliam was represented by his son Lord Milton, and it adopted the resolutions drafted by Fitzwilliam: the right to public assembly and condemnation of unlawful interference with it, and a demand for an inquiry into Peterloo. Fitzwilliam's objection, as he wrote on 17 October, was to: ...|$|E
