5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the song.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

25|$|Family, or lack thereof, remains {{important}} throughout both Hilde's {{childhood and}} adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This {{is represented by}} her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework. In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state. In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at {{the climax of the}} novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional {{to stand up to the}} beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.|$|E

50|$|Moral intellectualism or ethical intellectualism {{is a view}} in meta-ethics {{according}} to which genuine moral knowledge must {{take the form of}} arriving at discursive moral judgements about what one should do.In other words, virtue is knowledge: if you know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> you will do <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R

500|$|Arthur's unpopularity in life {{carried over}} into his {{assessment}} by historians, and his reputation after leaving office disappeared. [...] By 1935, historian George F. Howe said that Arthur had achieved [...] "an obscurity in strange contrast to his significant part in American history." [...] By 1975, however, Thomas C. Reeves would write that Arthur's [...] "appointments, if unspectacular, were unusually sound; the corruption and scandal that dominated business and politics of the period did not tarnish his administration." [...] As 2004 biographer Zachary Karabell wrote, although Arthur was [...] "physically stretched and emotionally strained, he strove to do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the country." [...] Indeed, Howe had earlier surmised, [...] "Arthur adopted [...] for his own political behavior but subject to three restraints: he remained to everyone {{a man of his}} word; he kept scrupulously free from corrupt graft; he maintained a personal dignity, affable and genial though he might be. These restraints... distinguished him sharply from the stereotype politician." ...|$|E

After {{the birth of his}} daughters, Stanley stopped going to sea and got a job with the Liverpool and Glasgow Tug Salvage Company as an {{insurance}} investigator. He moved his family to the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road. [...] According to Beatles biographer Bob Spitz, Mimi assumed a matriarchal role in the Stanley house to help her mother, and dressed [...] "as if {{she was on her way}} to a weekly garden club meeting". Friends of Lennon later stated that his aunt based everything on decorum, honesty, and a black-and-white attitude: [...] "Either you were good enough or you were not." [...] Lennon's school friend, Pete Shotton, later commented that she [...] "had a very strong sense of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> or wrong". [...] Annie Stanley died in 1941, so Mimi accepted the responsibility of caring for her father, with help from her younger sister, Julia.|$|E

The Indonesian Muslim leader Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, writing soon after Sudirman's death, described the general as a [...] "symbol of the strength of spirit shown by Indonesian heroes," [...] while the Muslim politician Muhammad Isa Anshary described Sudirman as a [...] "son of the revolution, as he was born in the revolution, and raised by the revolution." [...] In a radio speech, Hatta described Sudirman as impossible to control and hard-headed, but ultimately intent on doing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the country; Hatta noted that, although Sudirman often did not like the government's position, he would generally obey his orders. However, HamengkubuwanaIX noted that KNIL trained soldiers such as Abdul Haris Nasution and Tahi Bonar Simatupang were disappointed in Sudirman because of his background and poor knowledge of military techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
