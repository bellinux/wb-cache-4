50|$|The tool {{is rapidly}} twisted. The {{result is that}} 1.5 to 2 turns of {{insulated}} wire are <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>post,</b> and above that, 7 to 9 turns of bare wire are <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>post.</b> The post has room for three such connections, although usually {{only one or two}} are needed. This permits manual wire-wrapping to be used for repairs.|$|R
50|$|Initially, Mark Wahlberg {{was set to}} star. On November 9, 2012 The <b>Wrap</b> <b>posted</b> that Eric Bana was {{in talks}} to join the film, playing the lead role as a New York cop. On April 9, 2013 Bana {{confirmed}} {{his role in the}} film as a Catholic cop, and Olivia Munn and Édgar Ramírez were set to co-star as the cop's wife and a priest respectively. On May 28, 2013 Joel McHale and Sean Harris also joined the film; McHale played Bana's partner, a tough and experienced cop. Dorian Missick joined cast on June 5 {{to play the role of}} the cop Gordon. Other cast members include Chris Coy, Rhona Fox, and Valentina Rendón.|$|R

5|$|The film's {{shooting}} {{reached its}} final stages at Hyderabad in late May 2014, and the post-production phase began. A {{statement from the}} film's unit on 8 June 2014 stated that the principal photography had been <b>wrapped</b> up and <b>post</b> production work was under way, targeting a July 2014 release.|$|R

5000|$|Gould {{had been}} the {{designer}} with Glen Rogers of the Spirit Gate, a San Jose Public Art Program project completed in 2000 consisting of an ornamental gateway on The Alameda with concrete posts resembling elephant tusks and inspirational [...] "power words" [...] such as [...] "family" [...] and [...] "dream" [...] stencilled out of the circular gate itself. Hester students chose the words, and the mosaics that <b>wrap</b> around the <b>posts</b> are based on their drawings.|$|R
5000|$|Above {{the turn}} of {{insulated}} wire, the bare wire <b>wraps</b> around the <b>post.</b> The corners of the post bite in with pressures of tons per square inch. This forces all the gases {{out of the area}} between the wire's silver plate and the post's gold or tin corners. Further, with 28 such connections (seven turns on a four-cornered post), a very reliable connection exists between the wire and the post. Furthermore, the corners of the posts are quite [...] "sharp": they have a quite-small radius of curvature.|$|R
40|$|The {{guidelines}} for the installation and management of roadway safety features, revised in November 2012, is regulating the standard performance test for roadside longitudinal barriers to be implemented on an embankment instead of a flatland. Furthermore, the post installed on an embankment should have the resisting force of a construction site higher than 90 % of that of a test site. In this study, a variety of post reinforcement methods were investigated in order to strengthen the lateral resisting force of the post installed on an embankment. When increasing the post embedded depth to 1. 7 m from a non-reinforced post with an embedded depth of 1. 4 m, an increase of 33 % in resisting force occurred. For the case of having a small cross section and a small flexure length of the reinforcing plate <b>wrapping</b> a <b>post,</b> out of various forms of reinforcing plates, the constructability was excellent and the resisting force increased by 70 % approximately. For the reinforcement method using a bracing member, the increase of approximate 78 % occurred in resisting force. A SB 3 -B flexible barrier that uses {{the same as the}} components of the SB 5 -B flexible barrier which passed the flatland per-formance test was developed. Post spacing and post reinforcement methods appropriate for SB 3 -B impact conditions were deter...|$|R

The surface {{board of the}} se is slightly curved, and has three end bridges and one bridge at the head, plus four wooden posts for the strings to wrap around (some {{have two or three}} only). The posts also have patternation or decoration. The tail-end of the instrument has a long [...] " [...] 冂 [...] " [...] shopped opening for the strings to pass through. To string the instrument, one needs to tie a butterfly knot {{at the head of the}} string, strung through a bamboo rod, over the bridge at the head and over the main body of the instrument and over into the tail-end bridge into the instrument, out of the sound hole at the bottom of the instrument, over the tail-end and <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>posts</b> in four or three groups. The more modern form do not have the four posts and are instead strung a bit like the guzheng.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{furnishings}} {{placed in the}} house following the 1974 renovation were twentieth century copies of either colonial or Federal style pieces. A notable exception was a bed placed in the house by Nelson Rockefeller. The bed was designed by artist Max Ernst. Called the [...] "cage" [...] bed, the headboard had {{the form of a}} Greek pediment, and the baseboard a lower version of a pediment. Sculptural foliage similar to olive or laurel leaves <b>wrapped</b> around the <b>posts.</b> The seal of the Vice President of the United States was incorporated into the headboard. The Rockefellers twice offered the bed permanently to the house but it was turned down both by Vice President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. On visiting Barbara Bush at the house, Mrs. Rockefeller offered her the bed, and Mrs. Bush responded [...] "you are always welcome in this house, but there's no need to bring your own bed." [...] The Rockefellers did leave a lithograph called [...] "The Great Ignoramus," [...] several antique Korean and Japanese chests, and nearly a dozen other pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film three stars out of four, {{describing}} it as [...] "a fairly sophisticated satire, {{that makes you}} want to get up and shuffle." [...] He praised the film's sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and [...] "grubby, low-budget intensity." [...] Ebert states that [...] "if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2." [...] Richard Harrington of the Washington <b>Post</b> <b>wrapped</b> up his review stating that [...] "the acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?" [...] Conversely, Pat Graham of Chicago Reader disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that [...] "The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though {{on the basis of this}} strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark." ...|$|R
40|$|Brief summary In {{terms of}} {{security}} development, not much was discussed at OGC TC 62 : the Security WG did not meet, {{and the only}} major security-related meetings were the GeoXACML RWG, which looked at modifications to the GeoXACML discussion paper (mostly minor technical clarifications), {{as well as some}} conformance class definitions, and the Geo-RM RWG, which primarily focussed on discussion of license encoding. The Architecture WG also had some discussion of interest to the security domain, specifically a discussion on <b>wrapping</b> GET and <b>POST</b> services with SOAP (which will allow the application of GeoRM and other SOAP technologies to existing services without changing them). Of particular interest was the momentum behind using the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) approach for accessing Geo services and data, as opposed to SOAP/WSDL. There was {{a lot of interest in}} REST, and I'll summarise some of the discussion below, as well as some notes from the REST sub-committee meeting. In terms of workflow, the GPW thread of OWS- 5 had some discussion; another discussion of interest was held during the Decision Support WG (about the Conflation Workflow Architecture) ...|$|R
