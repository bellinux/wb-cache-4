25|$|Toilets in {{multi-story}} buildings, {{located on}} fire-resistance rated floors typically require {{at least two}} through-penetrations, which can compromise the rating of the floor if left untreated. One opening is for the fresh water supply to flush and/or fill the water tank. The other through-penetration is for the drain pipe. The fresh <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> requires routine firestopping. The drain pipe, however, is exempt from firestopping in many building codes, particularly when noncombustible piping is used, because the penetration terminates on the unexposed side in a ceramic bowl filled with water, which can withstand significant fires.|$|E

When needed, a hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line,</b> helium reclaim line, and/or video camera and lighting cables may be included. These components are neatly twisted into a multistrand cable, and are deployed as a single unit. The diver's end has underwater connectors for the electrical cables, and the air hoses are usually connected to the helmet, band mask, or bailout block by JIC fittings. A screw-gate carabiner or similar connector is provided on the strength member for attachment to the diver's harness, and may be used to lift the diver in an emergency. Similar connections are provided for attachment to the diving bell, if used, or to the surface gas panel and communications equipment.|$|E

50|$|If, for example, someone flushes {{a toilet}} while the shower is in use, the fixture {{suddenly}} draws {{a significant amount}} of cold water from the common supply line, causing a pressure drop. In the absence of a compensating mechanism, the relatively higher pressure in the hot <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> will cause the shower temperature to rise just as suddenly, possibly reaching an uncomfortable or even dangerous level.
