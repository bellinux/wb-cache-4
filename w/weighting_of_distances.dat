This paper presents data-driven high-dimensional scaling (DD-HDS), a nonlinear mapping method that follows the line of multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach, based on the preservation of distances between pairs of data. It improves the performance of existing competitors with respect to the representation of high-dimensional data, in two ways. It introduces (1) a specific <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>distances</b> between data taking into account the concentration of measure phenomenon and (2) a symmetric handling of short distances in the original and output spaces, avoiding false neighbor representations while still allowing some necessary tears in the original distribution. More precisely, the weighting is set according to the effective distribution of distances in the data set, {{with the exception of a}} single user-defined parameter setting the tradeoff between local neighborhood preservation and global mapping. The optimization of the stress criterion designed for the mapping is realized by "force-directed placement" (FDP). The mappings of low- and high-dimensional data sets are presented as illustrations of the features and advantages of the proposed algorithm. The weighting function specific to high-dimensional data and the symmetric handling of short distances can be easily incorporated in most distance preservation-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An optimal constant-composition or constant-weight code <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> has linear size if {{and only}} if its {{distance}} is at least. When, the determination of the exact size of such a constant-composition or constant-weight code is trivial, but the case of has been solved previously only for binary and ternary constant-composition and constant-weight codes, and for some sporadic instances. This paper provides a construction for quasicyclic optimal constant-composition and constant-weight codes <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>distance</b> based on a new general-ization of difference triangle sets. As a result, the sizes of optimal constant-composition codes and optimal constant-weight codes <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>distance</b> are determined for all such codes of sufficiently large lengths. This solves an open problem of Etzion. The sizes of optimal constant-composition codes <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>distance</b> are also determined for all, except in two cases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to test empirically some {{hypothesis}} about the relation between transport accessibility, geographic marginality and tourism development. To what extent and how accessibility can represent a limit to tourism development in peripheral areas? Tourism is historically connected {{to the development of the}} transport system and the reduction <b>of</b> economic <b>distances.</b> Regions like the South of Italy (Mezzogiorno) may have as well suffered for their geographic marginality. The development of tourism destinations in many peripheral areas however, demonstrates how marginality can even represent an attraction. The uneven development of Italian tourism (see figure 1) is not only influenced by physical accessibility, but rather by more complex problems of economic marginality. Accessibility, marginality and development are complex issues and – especially in the case of tourism – it is not possible to draw deterministic relationships. Mezzogiorno is the ideal context for the analysis <b>of</b> the effective <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> in travel choices and tourism development...|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} {{of economic activity}} in Spain is analysed, employing a methodology previously applied to Canada. We ask whether the regularities posited for Canada also hold for Spain, despite the differences in geography. Using census data for the years 1991 and 2001, Spain’s 8, 086 municipalities are classified accord-ing to population size and distance thresholds analo-gous to those applied to Canada. The location patterns of industries are plotted in relation to these classes. The results reveal, on the whole, spatial distribu-tions consistent with posited regularities and previous findings. Location patterns are fairly stable over time, reconfirming the continued <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> and <b>of</b> agglomeration economies. The results also show a crowding-out process in Spain, similar to that observed for other nations, fuelling the growth of manufactur-ing activity in locations {{in close proximity to}} metro-politan areas.

However, some experimental results show that, unexpectedly, farthest-first outperforms d-Confidence when finding rare instances in imbalanced low-dimensional data (Poker dataset) while the same is not observed in high-dimensional data (R 52 corpus). This has probably to do with the better discriminative abilities <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> at low-dimensional input spaces when compared to high-dimensional input spaces.

30|$|We {{prefer the}} second formula, which uses the {{relative}} importance scores as weights, because it distinguishes between level and importance. Instead of counting all level and importance scores equally, the weighted version counts level scores {{that are important to}} both occupations heavily and those that are unimportant (to at least one) only slightly. Only if the two occupations differ on important characteristics will they be measured as “far away” by this measure, whereas unimportant differences could result in an overstatement <b>of</b> the <b>distance</b> as measured in number 1. Consequently this paper employs the second (importance <b>weights)</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> between occupations. Once again, however, we have estimated the divorce model using non-importance-weighted distances and the estimates are robust to this.|$|R

Designed to simulate full-scale motor operating conditions, this laboratory apparatus uses a 2 -inch-diameter, end-burning propellant charge and an insulated disc of consolidated hydrated aluminum sulfate along with the explosive charge necessary to disperse the salt and inject it onto the burning surface. The VBA was constructed to permit variation of motor design parameters of interest; i. e., <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> salt per unit burning surface area, <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> explosive per unit <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> salt, <b>distance</b> from salt surface to burning surface, incidence angle of salt injection, chamber pressure, and burn time.

40|$|International audienceIn {{biological}} NMR, {{assignment of}} NOE cross-peaks and calculation of atomic conformations are {{critical steps in}} the determination of reliable high-resolution structures. ARIA is an automated approach that performs NOE assignment and structure calculation in a concomitant manner in an iterative procedure. The log-harmonic shape for distance restraint potential and the Bayesian <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> restraints, recently introduced in ARIA, were shown to significantly improve the quality and the accuracy of determined structures. In this paper, we propose two modifications of the ARIA protocol: (1) the softening of the force field together with adapted hydrogen radii, which is meaningful {{in the context of}} the log-harmonic potential with Bayesian weighting, (2) a procedure that automatically adjusts the violation tolerance used in the selection of active restraints, based on the fitting of the structure to the input data sets. The new ARIA protocols were fine-tuned on a set of eight protein targets from the CASD–NMR initiative. As a result, the convergence problems previously observed for some targets was resolved and the obtained structures exhibited better quality. In addition, the new ARIA protocols were applied for the structure calculation of ten new CASD–NMR targets in a blind fashion, i. e. without knowing the actual solution. Even though optimisation of parameters and pre-filtering of unrefined NOE peak lists were necessary for half of the targets, ARIA consistently and reliably determined very precise and highly accurate structures for all cases. In the context of integrative structural biology, an increasing number of experimental methods are used that produce distance data for the determination of 3 D structures of macromolecules, stressing the importance of methods that successfully make use of ambiguous and noisy distance data.

40|$|Corpus-based {{approaches}} to speech synthesis have been advocated {{to overcome the}} limitations of concatenative synthesis from a xed acoustic unit inventory. The frequency of unit concatenations in, e. g., diphone synthesis has been argued {{to contribute to the}} perceived lack of naturalness of synthetic speech.
