50|$|Clark-Norman Aircraft Ltd.(Triloader Aircraft Corp. NV Woudstraat 21, B-3600 Genk, Belgium)This {{company was}} formed in 1995 to develop the Triloader {{turbo-prop}} powered 19.000 lb.(All Up <b>Weight)</b> <b>Cargo</b> Aircraft. Design offices {{were based on the}} Isle of Wight with production to be undertaken by Triloader Aircraft of Belgium. Norman's co-designer on this aircraft was Alec N. Clark, formerly of Hawker Siddeley. Following the failure to secure long term funding for the Triloader, Clark transformed Triloader Aircraft corp into Wolfsberg Aircraft Corporation NV through which Clark developed the Raven 257 to compete with the BN Islander.|$|E

It {{operated}} a worldwide cargo and domestic passenger charter services from Voronezh, {{as well as}} regional passenger and cargo services from Sokol. It {{was one of two}} airlines which flew the Antonov An-124 Ruslan, the world's highest gross <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> airplane which specialises in oversized freight. Its collapse, over lease payments for these massive aircraft, left only the Volga-Dnepr Airlines/Antonov Airlines joint partnership in this market. Its main base was Chertovitskoye Airport, Voronezh. Polet is the Russian word for flight.|$|E

This includes development of animal models lacking key enzymes involved in proteoglycan assembly; application of genome-wide methods to identify novel genes involved in heparan sulfate assembly; analysis of guanidinylated glycosides that bind to proteoglycans; studies of proteoglycans in lipoprotein {{metabolism in the liver}} and macrophages; and studies of proteoglycan-associated receptors with particular emphasis on the vasculature and inflammation. He developed a carrier that exploits proteoglycans for delivery of high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> and used it for enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage disorders. Most recently, he developed a facile method for diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidoses. His work is best described as cross-disciplinary, spanning chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, and physiology.|$|E

40|$|The {{perspectives}} of development of medium <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> vehicles with hybrid powertrain including Russian native key components are considered in this article. Series-parallel scheme of HEV is more relevant owing to limitations of series and parallel schemes. An {{example of this}} technology is described. This technical solution has good facilities for variation of HEV and AWD type. The authors have patented it. In addition, another main issue is to choose the types of key components with good correlation for parameters of ICE, electric motors, batteries, and inverter. Using mathematical model of the vehicle a selection and correlation of technical characteristics were carried out to meet ecological and economical requirements. After computing calculation two control strategies were accepted. The first strategy contributes to good fuel consumption, while {{the other one is}} aimed at ecology. Researchers use test benches to confirm the results of calculation, and this one was built by the authors applying native components. The result of experiment on the test bench is the growth of fuel consumption of the medium <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> vehicle by 25 % and compliance with ecological class Euro- 4...|$|E

40|$|Guanidinylated {{neomycin}} (GNeo) can transport bioactive, {{high molecular}} <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> {{into the interior}} of cells {{in a process that}} depends on cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In this report, we show that GNeo-modified quantum dots bind to cell surface heparan sulfate, undergo endocytosis and eventually reach the lysosomal compartment. An N-hydroxysuccinimide activated ester of GNeo (GNeo-NHS) was prepared and conjugated to two lysosomal enzymes, β [...] glucuronidase (GUS) and α [...] iduronidase. Conjugation did not interfere with enzyme activity and enabled binding of the enzymes to heparin-Sepharose and heparan sulfate on primary human fibroblasts. Cells lacking the corresponding lysosomal enzyme took up sufficient amounts of the conjugated enzymes to restore normal turnover of glycosaminoglycans. The high capacity of proteoglycan-mediated uptake suggests that this method of delivery might be used for enzyme replacement or introduction of foreign enzymes into cells...|$|E

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{design optimization}} scheme for ships {{has been developed}} for use in an integrated ship design environment. Although the system was designed {{with the intention of}} using first principle analysis techniques, the containership design examples presented in this paper make use of surrogate parametric analysis modules developed to examine prob-lem formulation issues prior to the availability of the higher fidelity modules. A method of hull shape control based on a barycentric blend of basis hulls is developed. It requires rela-tively few design variables. In addition to general-purpose geometry, hydrostatic and re-sistance modules, containership-specific <b>weight,</b> <b>cargo</b> and economics modules were devel-oped. The measure of merit is taken to be the required freight rate. Optimal ship size is found to depend largely on port loading and unloading capabilities. The required freight rate increases and the speed of the optimal ship decreases as voyage length is decreased or fuel cost is increased...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{order picking}} {{activities}} in distribution center are mainly sorting and arrangement works classified by destinations {{in accordance with}} customer's request. The activities consist of lifting, moving, picking, putting, packing and other works basically. Also it can be classified into box picking, client picking, etc. according {{to the shape of}} products, type of process, type of picking system and so forth. In some companies, picking process consists of pre-picking and auto picking. Pre-picking refers to the work before the auto picking system classification where orders received from clients are checked and products are sorted by unit of box, pallet or auto picking unit. The auto picking (or semi auto picking) is defined as the process of sorting the pre-picking-treated products according to the units of clients, order, vehicles, etc. through the auto picking system. Although these activities are very simple and easy, every warehouse has different process for picking {{due to the lack of}} standard process. In this paper, we present a standard picking process for light <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> & productivity analysis for warehouse picking systems considering operational processes to compare: standard process versus ad-hoc process; conventional manual picking (e. g. manual digital picking system) versus automatic picking system...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, a 10 -amino acid sequence, namely BagP, located within BAG- 1 protein {{and which is}} rich in {{arginine}} and lysine residues was tested {{for its ability to}} act as a macromolecular carrier translocating cellular membranes. BagP was found to be a successful cell penetrating peptide (CPP), transferring high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>cargo</b> intracellularly in a vast range of cell types, albeit variably, with normal cells demonstrating a less permeable target for BagP, in contrast to the universal uptake of other peptides observed. The penetrating phenomenon of BagP was found to be both time- and concentration-dependent. In addition, the translocating ability of the peptide was found to be energy-reliant. Furthermore, the overall positive charge of BagP, as well as its initial interaction with heparin sulfate proteoglycans of the cellular membrane were found to be important parameters for its mechanism of translocation. The N-terminal of Bag- 1 is known to play a key part in the protein’s anti-apoptotic role. Since BagP originates from the N-terminal of Bag- 1, the peptide was tested for its ability to act antagonistically to several pathways that this terminal is known to be involved in. Hence, the antagonistic action of BagP in cells expressing Bag- 1 would cause increased apoptosis. It was found that BagP at a concentration of 0, 5 mM was able to induce increased apoptosis of the T cell lymphoma cell lines ALC (murine) and KARPAS- 299 (human). The rest of the cell lines tested remained unaffected, whereas smaller BagP concentrations had no biological effect in all the cell lines tested. It is well documented that resting Natural Killer (NK) cells express the common β and γ subunits of interleukin (IL) - 2 and IL- 15 receptors, and that NK proliferation increases in the presence of IL- 2 or IL- 15, whilst IL- 2 increases Bag- 1 concentration. Therefore, it was tested whether incubation of resting NK cells with BagP would antagonize the increase of Bag- 1 concentration due to the presence of IL- 15. Similarly, only 0, 5 mM of Bag- 1 concentration was found to increase the percentage of apoptotic cells. Moreover, since Bag- 1 inhibits the action of glucocorticoid receptor, if BagP would act as a Bag- 1 antagonist, it would interrupt such an inhibition, leading to cellular death. Indeed, BagP at 0, 5 mM, was found to lead to significant reduction of NK cell proliferation. Finally, we examined the ability of the BagP peptide to transfer intracellularly biologically active macromolecules. Initially, BagP was conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide sequence (antimyc-aug) that is known to inhibit the expression of c-myc gene. The conjugate was found to be intracellularly transferred and to cause a reduction of the proliferation rate, without affecting cellular viability, while it was found to reduce the concentration of c-MYC protein. In addition, BagP was complexed to monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin). The purpose of this experimental approach was to check if the intracellular localization of the antibody in cells expressing the antibody’s targeting protein, HER 2 /neu, would prevent its expression on the cell membrane, thus reducing the cells’ ability to proliferate. The outcome of the experimental procedures was neither clear nor conclusive and further investigation is required. ...|$|E

40|$|Cationic cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPP) {{are receiving}} increasing attention as molecular transporters of membrane-impermeable molecules. Import of cationic CPP occurs both via endocytosis and - at higher peptide concentrations - in an endocytosis-independent manner via localized {{regions of the}} plasma membrane. At present, this endocytosis-independent import of cationic CPP is not well understood, but {{has been shown to}} be sensitive to various pharmacological inhibitors, suggesting a role of an unidentified enzymatic activity. Here, we demonstrate that the direct translocation of cationic CPP depends on a CPP-induced translocation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and ceramide formation. The involvement of ASMase in uptake was confirmed by a pharmacological inhibition of ASMase by imipramine and a subsequent rescue of uptake through external addition of sphingomyelinase, and by using ASMase-deficient cells. We also found that the threshold for direct CPP translocation can be lowered through addition of sphingomyelinase and that sphingomyelinase enhances the translocation of R 9 coupled to low-molecular <b>weight</b> <b>cargos,</b> but not high-molecular <b>weight</b> <b>cargos.</b> In conclusion, we show that a previously poorly understood mechanism of cationic CPP import depends on the ASMase-dependent formation of ceramide on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, this is the first illustration that a class of delivery vectors operates through the induction of an enzymatic activity that changes the lipid composition of the plasma membrane...|$|R
