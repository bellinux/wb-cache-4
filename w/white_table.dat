25|$|In Britain, by 1853, {{invitations to}} tea among the prosperous and fashionable often {{included}} table-turning, {{a type of}} séance in which spirits were said to communicate with people seated around a table by tilting and rotating the table. One prominent convert was the French pedagogist Allan Kardec (1804–1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of spiritism, which became widespread in Latin countries. In Brazil, Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today. In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually {{gave birth to a}} movement known as mesa blanca (<b>white</b> <b>table).</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 1586, Hugh, 4th. Earl of Eglinton was {{travelling}} to Stirling to {{join the}} royal court having been commanded to attend by the King. He was accompanied only by a few domestic servants and being in no great hurry he stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, a Montgomerie who was Lord of Lainshaw and whose Lady was a Margaret Cunninghame of Aiket Castle, with sisters married to John Cunninghame of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland. It seems that a plot to kill the Earl {{as an act of}} revenge had been organised and the Lady, or some say a servant girl who was also a Cunninghame, climbed to the battlements after the meal to hang out a <b>white</b> <b>table</b> napkin and thereby spring the plot. Thirty Cunninghames attacked the Earl at the Annick ford and cut his servants to pieces with swords and other weapons, the Earl himself being finally dispatched with a single shot from the pistol of John Cuninghame of Clonbeith Castle. His horse carried his dead body {{along the side of the}} river, still known in Stewarton as the 'Weeping', 'Mourning' or 'Widows' path. A wave of bloody revenge swept over Cunninghame and elsewhere, with Cunninghame friends, relatives and adherents killed without restraint.|$|E

The body bag was placed on a <b>white</b> <b>table</b> at the rail of the ship, and the table was tipped to let the body bag slide into the sea, but the body bag did not slide and took the table with it.

The video begins with Cyrus and her backup dancers atop a stage in a crowded outdoor concert. Cyrus is dressed as Hannah Montana and is wearing a {{business}} suit. As Cyrus begins singing, she and the dancers engage in intricate choreography. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Cyrus' character is getting down from a private airplane. The video continues to alternate between Cyrus performing and more film clips; scenes include Stewart taking off her Hannah Montana wig and interacting with Travis Body, her love interest in the film, portrayed by actor Lucas Till. Midway through the video, Cyrus and her dancers exit the stage through a back door and instantly enter sporting western clothing with Cyrus in a western teal button up shirt, a checkered red and <b>white</b> <b>table</b> cloth with purple ruffles pettiskirt or a petticoat, and cowboy boots.|$|E
2500|$|Italian-Americans today {{appreciate}} {{a variety of}} wines, ranging from California wine and American wine, to imported Italian wine; with classics, such as Chianti (from Tuscany, Italy), generic red or <b>white</b> <b>table</b> wine (often called vino da tavola), to high-end [...] "Super Tuscan" [...] style wines such as Tignanello. [...] Chianti, when first introduced to the United States, was widely generic; however, after {{a decline in the}} overall quality of Chianti during the mid-20th century, improvements in recipes and techniques led to a variety of Chianti, ranging from simple to very high-end Classicos.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{the names}} [...] "Malvasia" [...] and [...] "Malmsey" [...] {{occurred}} interchangeably. , however, [...] "Malvasia" [...] generally refers to unfortified <b>white</b> <b>table</b> or dessert wines produced from this grape, while [...] "Malmsey" [...] {{refers to a}} sweet variety of Madeira wine, though this is also sometimes called [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia". Further confusion results {{from the fact that}}, in the recent past, the term [...] "Malmsey" [...] referred to any very sweet Madeira wine, regardless of the grape variety involved. This resulted from the devastation of Madeiran vineyards by phylloxera in the late 19th century, which greatly reduced the production of Malvasia and other [...] "noble grape" [...] varieties on Madeira for the next century. As a result, most non-vintage-dated [...] "Malmsey" [...] was made from the widely grown Tinta Negra Mole or even from fox grape varieties. This changed when Portugal entered the European Union (EU) in 1986; EU regulations required that any wine bearing the name [...] "Malmsey" [...] contain at least 85% Malvasia grapes. Even further confusion results from the fact that vintage-dated Malmseys are often labeled [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia", probably because the relatively rare vintage Malvasias were always made with Malvasia grapes even when most non-vintage [...] "Malmsey" [...] came from lesser varieties. Some companies occasionally use the name [...] "Malvasia" [...] or [...] "Malvazia" [...] for non-vintage Madeiras, especially those primarily marketed to Portuguese-speaking countries.|$|E

Cinghiale being wild boar, we sniffed the air. The girl kept {{tramping}} rather fecklessly back and forth, with a plate or a serviette: and at last it was served. We went through the dark inner place, which was apparently the windowless bit left over, inside, when the hap-hazard rooms were made round about, and from thence into a large, bare, darkish pebbled room with a <b>white</b> <b>table</b> and inverted soup-plates. It was deathly cold. The window looked north over the wintry landscape of the highlands, fields, stone walls, and rocks. Ah, the cold, motionless air of the room.|$|E
6000|$|He heard a clear, rather languid and {{delicate}} voice quietly speak on until it {{broke into a}} little peal of laughter, followed, when it fell silent by Sheila's--rapid, rich, and low. The first speaker seemed to be standing. Probably, then, his evening visitors had only just come in, or were preparing to depart. He inserted his latchkey and gently pushed at the cumbersome door. It was locked against him. With not the faintest thought of resentment or surprise, he turned back, stooped over the balustrade and {{looked down into the}} kitchen.

It gave Hermione a sudden convulsive sensation of pleasure, to see these rich colours under the candle-light. She {{was aware of the}} talk going on, ceaselessly, Joshua's voice dominating; of the ceaseless pitter-patter of women's light laughter and responses; of the brilliant colours and the <b>white</b> <b>table</b> and the shadow above and below; and she seemed in a swoon of gratification, convulsed with pleasure and yet sick, like a REVENANT.

60|$|We {{took our}} seats round the same clean, <b>white</b> <b>table,</b> and {{received}} our favorite beverage {{in the same}} bright tankards. They were set before us by the sober Margery, no one else being visible. As frequently happen'd, {{we were the only}} company. Walking and breathing the keen, fine air had made us dry, and we soon drain'd the foaming vessels, and call'd for more. I remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that had just made their appearance from a great British author, and were creating quite a public stir. There was one, a tale of passion and despair, which Wheaton had read, and of which he gave us a transcript. Wild, startling, and dreamy, perhaps it threw over our minds its peculiar cast. An hour moved off, and we began to think it strange that neither Ninon or the widow came into the room. One of us gave a hint to that effect to Margery; but she made no answer, and went on in her usual way as before.|$|E

And then one wonderful day there came to Mrs. Gerhardt a strange letter, announcing that Gerhardt was coming home. He would not be sent to Germany--he was coming home! To-day, that very day--any moment he might be with her. When she received it, who had long received no letters save the weekly letters of her boy still in the army, she was spreading margarine on auntie's bread for breakfast, and, moved beyond all control, she spread it thick, wickedly, wastefully thick, then dropped the knife, sobbed, laughed, clasped {{her hands on her}} breast, and without rhyme or reason, began singing: [...] "Hark! the herald angels sing." [...] The girls had gone to school already, auntie in the room above could not hear her, no one heard her, nor saw her drop suddenly into the wooden chair, and, with her bare arms stretched out one {{on either side of the}} plate of bread and margarine, cry her heart out against the clean <b>white</b> <b>table.</b> Coming home, coming home, coming home!

60|$|These {{abstract}} {{questions are}} inseparably interwoven with my {{memory of a}} shining long <b>white</b> <b>table,</b> and our hock bottles and burgundy bottles, and bottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed central trophy of dessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and cigarette-ends and menu-cards used for memoranda. I see old Dayton sitting back and cocking his eye to the ceiling {{in a way he}} had while he threw warmth into the ancient platitudes of Liberalism, and Minns leaning forward, and a little like a cockatoo with a taste for confidences, telling us in a hushed voice of his faith in the Destiny of Mankind. Thorns lounges, rolling his round face and round eyes from speaker to speaker and sounding the visible depths of misery whenever Neal begins. Gerbault and Gane were given to conversation in undertones, and Bailey pursued mysterious purposes in lisping whispers. It was Crupp attracted me most. He had, as people say, his eye on me from the beginning. He used to speak at me, and drifted into a custom of coming home with me very regularly for an after-talk.|$|E
