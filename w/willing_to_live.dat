When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the theory of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and strengthened or stable <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> survived longer in comparison to those with a weak <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.The second study presented the idea of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> lived the longest while high <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.Other accounts of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and {{is a good example of}} this as well. A proposed mechanism for the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.Powerful examples of humans having a <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.|$|R

The concept of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> can be seen as directly impacted by hope. Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described concepts such as the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> as a direct component of their survival. The difference between the wish to die versus the wish <b>to</b> <b>live</b> is also a unique risk factor for suicide.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> by evaluating its association with the wish to prolong life and with indicators of well-being among men and women. First were assessed the strength of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> and its relationship to the wish to prolong life in hypothetical illness conditions. Next, association between the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> and explanatory factors, such as religious beliefs, fear of death and dying, physical and psycho-social dimensions of well-being were comparatively evaluated among men and women. Data were collected from a random sample of 987 Israeli elderly persons by structured interviews at the participants' homes. Findings indicated that women express a significantly weaker <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> than men, and less desire to prolong life by medical interventions in all the hypothetical health conditions presented to them. Gender differences were also found on the variables which contribute to the explanation of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> live: For both genders, psycho-social indicators of well-being had more explanatory power than health indicators of well-being, but this finding was more striking among women. The implications of these findings for the study of the perceived meaningfulness of life, and the potential use of the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> as an indicator of well-being are discussed. <b>Will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> Life-sustaining treatments Gender Elderly persons Religiosity Israel...|$|R

25|$|Economist Thomas Sowell (2001) {{argues that}} {{immigrants}} during Riis's time were typically <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy {{that allowed them}} to save more than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly to allow for the high rate of savings possible in the tenements. Moreover, according to Sowell, Riis's own personal experiences were the rule rather than the exception during his era: like most immigrants and low-income persons, he lived in the tenements only temporarily before gradually earning more income and relocating to different lodgings.|$|E

The students were also asked to assess elderly's wishes. Students ranked the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> of elderly persons significantly lower than their own. The elderly ranked their <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> significantly lower than did the students, but higher than the students assumed about them, indicating that although the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> is weaker among older people, it is stronger than young persons believe. With regard to the use of LST, students believe that old people want less LST than themselves, but the elderly want even less LST than assumed by the students. The best predictors of students' wishes for themselves were fear of dying and religiosity. Fear of dying, the students' self-esteem and religiosity were the best predictors of their evaluations of the elderly's wishes. The results indicate that both the elderly and the students have a relatively strong <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>live,</b> but this desire is dependent on quality of life.

Jewish inhabitants were able and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the buildings, and to explain this the Nice Matin reporter surmised that some tenants may have not read the condominium contracts in detail, while others deemed the rules obsolete. A reason for the latter is that any racially discriminatory condominium or other local rule that may have existed [...] "on paper", Vichy-era or otherwise, was invalidated by the constitutions of the French Fourth Republic (1946) and French Fifth Republic (1958) and was inapplicable under French antidiscrimination law. Thus, even if the tenants or coowners had signed or otherwise agreed to these rules after 1946, any such agreement would be null and void (caduque) under French law, as were the rules. Rewriting or eliminating the obsolete rules would have had to be done at the occupants' expense, including notary fees of 900 to 7000 EUR per building.|$|E
