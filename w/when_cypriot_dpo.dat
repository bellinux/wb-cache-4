2500|$|Until 1974 Nea Salamis had a {{track-and-field}} program. The club's {{track team}} {{was founded by}} Cypriot champions Nikis Georgiou and Antonis Totsis, who had been expelled from the GSE.

50|$|<b>When</b> Greek <b>Cypriots</b> {{wanted to}} reduce {{autonomy}} and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led {{the two communities}} {{to embark on a}} hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{division}} of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the Akritas plan, which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots {{in a few days}} should they not accept the plan. Tensions were heightened <b>when</b> <b>Cypriot</b> President Archbishop Makarios III called for constitutional changes, which were rejected by Turkey and opposed by Turkish Cypriots.|$|R

40|$|Cypriot coroplastic {{receives}} oriental influences, {{from the}} Syro-palestinian coast, {{at least since}} the Late Bronze Age, which is apparent in the nude figurines of the Base-Ring category.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{approaches}} to resolve the Cyprus dispute, including the reunification into a single state and alternatively the Two-state solution, which would basically legalize the current status quo <b>when</b> Greek <b>Cypriots</b> govern {{the southern part of}} the island, whereas Turkish-occupied areas with Turkic majority are governed by their own Turkic Cypriot government.|$|R

50|$|Cyprus {{was also}} the first European country (and the second world-wide, after Uruguay) to officially {{recognise}} the Armenian Genocide. On 24 April 1975, after the determined efforts and the submission by Representative Dr. Antranik L. Ashdjian, Resolution 36 was voted unanimously by the House of Representatives. Representative Aram Kalaydjian was instrumental in passing unanimously through the House of Representatives two more resolutions regarding the Armenian Genocide: Resolution 74/29-04-1982, submitted by the Foreign Relations' Parliamentary Committee, and Resolution 103/19-04-1990, submitted by all parliamentary parties.

2500|$|British colonial {{policies}} also promoted ethnic polarization.

50|$|During {{the early}} hours of 21 December 1963, Greek Cypriot police {{operating}} within the old Venetian walls of Nicosia demanded to see the identification papers of some Turkish Cypriots who were returning home from an evening out. These Turkish Cypriots were being driven in a taxi by taxi driver Zeki Halil and were around Hermes Street en route to Taht-el Kale. When the police officers attempted to search the women in the car, Halil objected and a discussion ensued. As word of the incident quickly spread a hostile crowd gathered. Upon this, the police called for reinforcements from Paphos Gate; and Cemaliye Emirali, the ex-lover of Zeki Halil, who was similarly returning from a night out, saw the incident and got involved. One of the policemen that had been called as part of the reinforcements took out his gun and shot and killed Zeki Halil and Cemaliye Emirali. By dawn two Turkish Cypriots were dead and eight others, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, were wounded. As the day progressed there were numerous reports of sporadic gunfire around the old town as a large crowd of Turkish Cypriots, many armed, roamed the streets. Initial appeals for calm issued by President Makarios and Vice-President Küçük were ignored and by afternoon the fighting had spread {{to other parts of the}} capital. By the next morning, authorities in Larnaca were also reporting violent incidents. However, as evening approached the situation on the island appeared to be calming down. It was a short lived respite. Fighting erupted again the following morning <b>when</b> Greek <b>Cypriot</b> families living in the strategically important Nicosia suburb of Omorphita, which was primarily Turkish Cypriot, came under heavy attack. Soon afterwards conflict broke out in Famagusta <b>when</b> Turkish <b>Cypriot</b> gendarmes attempted to storm their headquarters. Likewise, fighting was reported from Kyrenia.|$|R

Due to the continued ethnic violence between the Cypriot Turks and Cypriot Greeks, President Gürsel ordered warning flights and subsequent continuous air assaults by the Turkish Air Force against the island which continued between 7 and 10 August 1964, ending with the fulfilment of the military objectives of Turkey, and the invitation to calm by Nikita Khrushchev of USSR.|$|R

Approximately 5,500 Turkish Cypriots were displaced from Omorfita. The third conflict-related displacement {{took place in the}} summer of 1974, when all the Greek Cypriots from the village fled from the advancing Turkish army and Turkish Cypriot Fighters in July and August 1974.
