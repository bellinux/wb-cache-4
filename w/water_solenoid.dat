Toward this goal, a computer controlled system has been developed and built for interlocking tests run on elevated temperature mechanical test facilities. Sensors for water flow, water pressure, water leakage, temperature, power and hydraulic status are monitored to control specimen heating equipment through solid state relays and <b>water</b> <b>solenoid</b> valves. The system is designed {{to work with the}} default interlocks present in the RF generators and mechanical tests systems. Digital hardware consists of two National Instruments 1 / 0 boards mounted in a Macintosh IIci computer. Software is written in National Instruments LabVIEW. Systems interlocked include two MTS closed loop servo controlled hydraulic test frames, one with an RF generator and one with both an RF generator and a quartz lamp furnace. Control for individual test systems is modularized making the addition of more systems simple. If any of the supporting utilities fail during tests, heating systems, chill water and hydraulics are powered down, minimizing specimen damage and eliminating equipment damage.

40|$|Cunningham (2000) and Jotisankasa (2005) {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of tensiometerbased suction control systems. In these systems, wetting and drying of the soil are achieved by water injection and circulation of air {{in contact with the}} specimen while suction is monitored by sample-mounted high suction tensiometers. Unlike the axis translation technique, these systems avoid using elevated air pressures and better reproduce the drying and wetting conditions occurring in the field. Building upon these earlier works, this paper describes an automated tensiometer-based suction control system that enables direct measurement of water content changes inside the sample. A diaphragm pump forces air to flow inside a closed loop that runs across the sample while a moisture trap ensures that the relative humidity of the circulating air is kept low. As the circulating air dries the soil, the amount of abstracted water is measured by continuous weighing of the desiccant inside the moisture trap. Wetting of the sample is instead achieved by controlled injection of <b>water</b> through a <b>solenoid</b> valve connected to a pressurized volume gauge. The changes of soil water content are given by the difference between the amounts of water injected by the volume gauge and that retained by the desiccant. The system is used to impose cycles of drying and wetting on compacted clayey specimens and results from preliminary tests are presented. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The DIII-D tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} since June 1995 with constrained ohmic heating capability as {{imposed by the}} abandonment of half of it`s solenoid system due to a cooling <b>water</b> leak. The <b>solenoid</b> is comprised of A and B windings with separate multiple power leads to each. The cooling water leak occurred in {{the lead of the}} B winding. This leak occurred in a remote area under the DIII-D vessel and is believed to be caused by magnetic forces developing cyclic bending loads on the conductor. Visual inspection of the lead using flexible bore scopes indicated that the structural fiberglass overwrap intended to band the supply and return leads into a primary-force canceling group had failed allowing individual conductors to become inadequately supported against bending loads. The overwrap failed as a result of poor epoxy encapsulation of the lead which was manufactured in 1978. Inspection of the A lead confirmed no overwrap failure and that the vacuum encapsulation of the A lead was proper and to specification. In order to continue operations, it was decided to abandon the B winding of the solenoid and operate under reduced (5 V-sec) capability. An in-situ repair approach was mandated by the extensive and lengthy effort required to disassemble, repair, and reassemble the tokamak. Access from outside the tokamak was severely limited. A plan to repair the damaged lead was developed and implemented over a 10 month period. This paper describes the repair of the solenoid lead.

40|$|This article {{presents}} various operating systems, developed and implemented at the Athens Tram network {{to reduce the}} airborne noise emitted in the sharp curves of the tramway. From {{the first days of}} the network's operation (Olympic Games 2004), the problem of producing airborne squealing noise in certain sharp curves of the tramway was revealed, with a series of complaints to be recorded from residents in certain urban areas, regarding especially squealing noise emissions introducing annoying peak levels especially during evening & night hours. The problem was treated, initially, by coating the tracks with biodegradable lubricant, at sharp curves, where it appeared that friction phenomena were significant. The coating has been performed manually for some years by maintenance personnel of the network, providing suitable results by the acoustic measurement program. Even though this intervention has produced positive results, as well as alternative technical solutions relating to the installation of mechanisms for automatic lubrication of rails with special friction modifiers, they were proven not to be feasible economically. Therefore an automatic rail wetting system was implied, containing sensors to detect approaching trams, <b>water</b> supply, timer, <b>solenoid</b> valves, pipes and common irrigation vaporizers. The system is quite simple and is implemented using common components of retail trade, many of which are already used in existing irrigation network of the tramway, while the maintenance does not require trained staff, it is performed by the staff of TRAM SA and in connection with the maintenance of the irrigation network. The results of recently executed detailed noise monitoring programs, performed by the University of Thessaly (Faculty of Civil Engineering), are presented for both implemented technical solutions that indicate significant reduction in squealing noise emissions...|$|R
40|$|The main aim {{of smart}} cities {{is to achieve}} the {{sustainable}} use of resources. In {{order to make the}} correct use of resources, an accurate monitoring and management is needed. In some places, like underground aquifers, access for monitoring can be difficult, therefore the use of sensors can be a good solution. Groundwater is very important as a water resource. Just in the USA, aquifers represent the water source for 50 % of the population. However, aquifers are endangered due to the contamination. One of the most important parameters to monitor in groundwater is the salinity, as high salinity levels indicate groundwater salinization. In this paper, we present a specific sensor for monitoring groundwater salinization. The sensor is able to measure the electric conductivity of water, which {{is directly related to the}} water salinization. The sensor, which is composed of two copper coils, measures the magnetic field alterations due to the presence of electric charges in the water. Different salinities of the water generate different alterations. Our sensor has undergone several tests in order to obtain a conductivity sensor with enough accuracy. First, several prototypes are tested and are compared with the purpose of choosing the best combination of coils. After the best prototype was selected, it was calibrated using up to 30 different samples. Our conductivity sensor presents an operational range from 0. 585 mS/cm to 73. 8 mS/cm, which is wide enough to cover the typical range of water salinities. With this work, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to measure <b>water</b> conductivity using <b>solenoid</b> coils and that this is a low cost application for groundwater monitoring...|$|R
