5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used to generate}} hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents {{the formation of an}} oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E

5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down {{to bring in a}} single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where}} the ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|When sieved {{from the}} water, food is {{swallowed}} and travels through the esophagus where it enters a three-chambered-stomach. The first compartment {{is known as}} the fore-stomach; this is where food gets ground up into an acidic liquid, which is then squirted into the main stomach. Like in humans, the food is mixed with hydrochloric acid and protein-digesting enzymes. Then, the partly digested food is moved into the third stomach, where it meets fat-digesting enzymes, and is then mixed with an alkaline liquid to neutralize the acid from the fore-stomach to prevent damage to the intestinal tract. Their intestinal tract is highly adapted to absorb the most nutrients from food; the walls are folded and contain copious blood vessels, allowing for a greater surface area over which digested food and <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> absorbed. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food; however, the salt content of most of their prey (invertebrates) are similar to that of seawater, whereas the salt content of a whale's blood is considerably lower (three times lower) than that of seawater. The whale kidney is adapted to excreting excess salt; however, while producing urine more concentrated than seawater, it wastes a lot of water which must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Well <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{very rich}} in radon; {{the use of}} this water inside a house is an {{additional}} route allowing radon to enter the house. The radon can enter the air and then be a source of exposure to the humans, or the <b>water</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> consumed by humans which is a different exposure route.|$|E

50|$|After a first {{settling}} and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to {{be treated}} (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.|$|R
25|$|Quinine, {{a bitter}} {{medicinal}} found in tonic <b>water,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to subjectively rate {{the bitterness of}} a substance. Units of dilute quinine hydrochloride (1 g in 2000 mL of <b>water)</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used to measure the}} threshold bitterness concentration, the level at which the presence of a dilute bitter substance can be detected by a human taster, of other compounds. More formal chemical analysis, while possible, is difficult.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{focus on}} water {{resources}} {{and the use of}} mineral waters in human nutrition, especially in the different stages of life, in physical activity and in the presence of some morbid conditions. Mineral water is characterized by its purity at source, its content in minerals, trace elements and other constituents, its conservation and its heating properties recognized by the Ministry of Health after clinical and pharmacological trials. Based on total salt content in grams after evaporation of 11 mineral water dried at 180 degrees C (dry residues), mineral <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified as: <b>waters</b> with a very low mineral content, waters tow in mineral content, waters with a medium mineral content, and strongly mineralized waters. Based on ion composition mineral <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified as: bicarbonate waters, sulfate waters, sodium chloride or saltwater, sulfurous waters. Based on biological activity mineral <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified as: diuretic waters, cathartic waters, waters with antiphlogistic properties.

25|$|Dioxins {{accumulate}} in food chains {{in a fashion}} similar to other chlorinated compounds (bioaccumulation).

50|$|The minimum {{water flow}} from Bangladesh coast to the Bay of Bengal sea is 7,000 cumecs which {{is equal to}} 220 bcm annually.

The advantage of this scheme is that Ganga and Bramhaputra river <b>waters</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> stored on Bay of Bengal sea area and nearly 440 bcm water @ 14,000 cumecs transferred throughout the year to other river basins including Ganga basin at optimum pumping head.|$|R
