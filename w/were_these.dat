5|$|To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an {{imperial}} decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry {{women from the}} Manchu Banners, {{with the permission of}} the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Only later in the dynasty <b>were</b> <b>these</b> policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful <b>were</b> <b>these</b> criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments <b>were</b> <b>these</b> two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of uranium}} {{in its natural}} oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when {{it was used to}} add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore <b>were</b> <b>these</b> mines.|$|E

25|$|British colonial {{officials}} {{sometimes referred}} to as proconsuls include Alfred Milner in South Africa, Lord Curzon in India, Lord Lugard in Nigeria, and Lord Kitchener in Egypt and Sudan. These leaders were able to take imperial initiatives even when the government in London was reluctant.

25|$|At {{other times}} clan names and patronymics ("son of") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu.

25|$|Included in the Indexes, at one point, {{were many}} of the great works of Spanish literature. Also, a number of {{religious}} writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how <b>were</b> <b>these</b> Spanish authors published {{in the first place}} if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced prepublication licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.|$|E
25|$|Field became First Sea Lord in July 1930. The {{greatest}} crisis {{faced by}} Field at the Admiralty was the pay crisis that soon followed. With the ongoing effects of worldwide depression and budget restrictions, a 25% pay cut was introduced across the fleet and one shilling per day {{was taken from}} every naval man. It <b>were</b> <b>these</b> proposed measures {{which led to the}} Invergordon Mutiny in September 1931 when the sailors of the Atlantic Fleet at Invergordon left their ships and refused duty. At King George V's insistence, Admiral Sir John Kelly, who was popular with the fleet, was brought out of retirement to take command of the Atlantic Fleet, and the cabinet, acting on Field's advice, hurriedly reconsidered its budget: the pay cuts were restricted to 10% rather than 25%. During the early months of this crisis, Field suffered a perforated ulcer.|$|E
25|$|After {{some time}} {{the reason for}} the {{presence}} of voluntary police officers had changed. No longer <b>were</b> <b>these</b> men and women called into service only for emergencies. More and more they became part of the regular teams of police officers and started doing all sorts of regular police tasks. As of 1994, along with the first great reform of the Dutch police, police volunteers were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, new voluntary police officers were no longer equipped with a pistol. Those who started before 1994 were allowed to keep their pistol, as long as they kept up training. Since 2005, all voluntary police officers are equipped with pepper spray. As of today, voluntary police officers are again equipped with a pistol, after having acquired a full police diploma, successfully completed several years of field-experience as an unarmed officer, and completed an additional police safety training. In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three years down to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.|$|E

25|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} in two segments. Original construction commenced in early 1997 at the City Creek Portal, and mining progressed along an uphill gradient from east to west. After two years of mining effort, and more than 8,000 feet into the tunnel alignment, groundwater flows into the excavated tunnel began to steadily increase. Following extensive consultation with the United States Forest Service, MWD decided to halt mining on the east tunnel and install the final 12-foot diameter pipe liner in the excavated portion of the tunnel. MWD and the Forest Service worked to determine how best to complete the remaining 22,458feet of the tunnel. This collaboration resulted in significant revisions to the original design, revisions that would ultimately allow the tunneling effort to meet the strict groundwater inflow requirements of the Forest Service Special Use Permit. The tunnel was redesigned to use bolted and gasketed precast concrete tunnel segments. Not only <b>were</b> <b>these</b> segments designed to provide structural support to the mined tunnel, but they also were capable of delivering a nearly watertight environment inside the tunnel to dramatically {{limit the amount of}} groundwater inflow during the mining operations. Construction resumed from the Strawberry portal, working toward the original City Creek Portal construction.|$|E
25|$|His {{scholarship}} and {{his interest in}} questions of the day led him into affiliations {{with many of the}} learned societies. Nor <b>were</b> <b>these</b> affiliations perfunctory only. He regularly attended the society meetings, wrote papers for them, and rose to the highest places in their councils. He was president of the American Social Science Association (1897), International Law Association (1899), American Historical Association (1905), Political Science Association (1910), American Society for the Judicial Settlement of International Disputes (1911), Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, Connecticut Society of the Archeological Institute of America (1914). He was vice-president of the Archeological Institute of America (1898) and of the social and economic science section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1903). He was an associate of the Institute of International Law. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912. He was a member also of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Society, elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893, and a corresponding member of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Colonial Society of Massachusetts, and L'Institut de Droit Comparé.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, physics {{had evolved}} to the point at which {{classical}} mechanics could cope with highly complex problems involving macroscopic situations; thermodynamics and kinetic theory were well established; geometrical and physical optics could be understood in terms of electromagnetic waves; and the conservation laws for energy and momentum (and mass) were widely accepted. So profound <b>were</b> <b>these</b> and other developments that it was generally accepted that all the important laws of physics had been discovered and that, henceforth, research would be concerned with clearing up minor problems and particularly with improvements of method and measurement. However, around 1900 serious doubts arose about the completeness of the classical theories—the triumph of Maxwell's theories, for example, was undermined by inadequacies that had already begun to appear—and their inability to explain certain physical phenomena, such as the energy distribution in blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, while some of the theoretical formulations led to paradoxes when pushed to the limit. Prominent physicists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Cohn, Ernst Wiechert and Wilhelm Wien believed that some modification of Maxwell's equations might provide the basis for all physical laws. These shortcomings of classical physics were never to be resolved and new ideas were required. At the beginning of the 20th century a major revolution shook the world of physics, which led to a new era, generally referred to as modern physics.|$|E
