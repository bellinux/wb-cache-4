5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as silver birch, warty birch or East Asian <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> bolete, white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or swampy areas, often growing among sphagnum moss.|$|E
5|$|The papery bark of the <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> tree (Betula papyrifera) {{was used}} {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams {{were covered by}} it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E

5|$|Barely Real is the 1992 {{extended}} play (EP) by the American indie {{rock band}} Codeine. After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their follow-up album The <b>White</b> <b>Birch</b> in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios. As Codeine could not record enough material for a full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European beech (Fagus sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that {{what he described as}} spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E

The Ojibway named the area [...] "Wasakwagama", meaning White Tree Water, after the many <b>white</b> <b>birches</b> growing there, {{particularly}} on McRae Island. A fur trading post was established in 1905 by Mort and John Moore.

5|$|Highly abundant, {{the brown}} roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely {{distributed}} across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, {{where it has}} been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P.involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.|$|E

Here scream the jays and the eagles, and fish-hawks make their nests undisturbed; and the tide rises and falls under black branches of evergreen, from which depend long, light festoons of delicate gray moss. The darkness of the forest is relieved by the delicate foliage and the silvery trunks of the great <b>white</b> <b>birches,</b> which the solitude of centuries has allowed to grow in this spot to a height and size seldom attained elsewhere.|$|R

25|$|On dry upland sites, {{especially}} south-facing slopes, {{the mature}} vegetation is white spruce, <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> trembling aspen, {{or a combination}} of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after fire before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the hardwoods or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.|$|E

25|$|Rondane is {{a typical}} high {{mountain}} area, with large plateaus {{and a total of}} ten peaks above 2,000m (6,560ft). The highest point is Rondeslottet ("The Rondane Castle") at an altitude of 2,178m (7,146ft). The lowest point is just below the tree line, which is approximately 1,000 to 1,100m (about 3,300 to 3,600ft) above sea level. The climate is mild but relatively arid. Apart from the <b>White</b> <b>Birch</b> trees of the lower areas, the soil and rocks are covered by heather and lichen, since they lack nutrients. The largest mountains are almost entirely barren; above 1,500m (5,000ft) nothing but the hardiest lichens grow on the bare stones.|$|E
60|$|There {{the seasons}} stopped awhile. Autumn was gone, Winter was not. We had Time dealt out to us--mere, clear, fresh Time--grace-days to enjoy. The white wooden farm-houses were banked round two feet deep with dried leaves or earth, and the {{choppers}} {{went out to}} get ready next year's stores of wood. Now, chopping is an art, and the chopper in all respects an artist. He makes his own axe-helve, and for each man there is but one perfect piece of wood in all the world. This he never finds, but the likest substitute is trimmed and balanced and poised to that ideal. One man I know has evolved very nearly the weapon of Umslopogaas. It is almost straight, lapped at the butt with leather, amazingly springy, and carries a two-edged blade for splitting and chopping. If his Demon be with him--and what artist can answer for all his moods?--he will cause a tree to fall upon any stick or stone that you choose, uphill or down, to the right or to the left. Artist-like, however, he explains that that is nothing. Any fool can play with a tree in the open, but it needs the craftsman to bring a tree down in thick timber and do no harm. To see an eighty-foot maple, four feet in the butt, dropped, deftly as a fly is cast, in {{the only place where}} it will not outrage the feelings and swipe off the tops of fifty juniors, is a revelation. White pine, hemlock, and spruce share this country with maples, black and <b>white</b> <b>birches,</b> and beech. Maple seems to have few preferences, and the <b>white</b> <b>birches</b> straggle and shiver on the outskirts of every camp; but the pines hold together in solid regiments, sending out skirmishers to invade a neglected pasture on the first opportunity. There is no overcoat warmer than the pines in a gale when the woods for miles round are singing like cathedral organs, and the first snow of the year powders the rock-ledges.|$|R
