5|$|Television {{has played}} a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's {{decision}} to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.|$|E
