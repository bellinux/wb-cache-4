40|$|An ultra-high {{sensitivity}} double-slot hybrid plasmonic (DSHP) ring resonator, {{used for}} optical sensors and modulators, is developed. Due to high index contrast, {{as well as}} plasmonic enhancement, a considerable part of the optical energy is concentrated in the narrow slots between Si and plasmonic materials (silver is used in this paper), which leads to high sensitivity to the infiltrating materials. By partial opening of the outer plasmonic circular sheet of the DSHP ring, a conventional side-coupled silicon on insulator (SOI) bus waveguide can be used. Experimental results demonstrate ultra-high sensitivity (687. 5 nm/RIU) of the developed DSHP ring resonator, which is about five-times higher than for the conventional Si ring with the same geometry.

40|$|We {{consider}} interacting vortices in a quasi-one-dimensional {{array of}} Josephson junctions <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>capacitance.</b> If the charging {{energy of a}} junction is {{of the order of}} the Josephson energy, the fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter in the system are considerable, and the Vortices behave as quantum particles. Their density may be tuned by an external magnetic field, and therefore one can control the commensurability of the one-dimensional vortex lattice with the lattice of Josephson junctions. We show that the interplay between the quantum nature of a vortex and the long-range interaction between the vortices leads to the existence of a specific commensurate-incommensurate transition in a one-dimensional vortex lattice. In the commensurate phase an elementary excitation is a soliton with energy separated from the ground state by a finite gap. This gap vanishes in the incommensurate phase. Each soliton carries a fraction of a flux quantum; the propagation of solitons leads to a finite resistance of the array. We find the dependence of the resistance activation energy on the magnetic field and parameters of the Josephson array. This energy consists of the above-mentioned gap, and also of a boundary pinning term, which is different in the commensurate and incommensurate phases. The developed theory allows us to explain quantitatively the available experimental data. [S 0163 - 1829 (99) 00402 - 6]...|$|E

40|$|In {{the world}} of DC railway trains nowadays, asynchronous-{{traction}} machine with traction controllers, i. e. an inverter with variable output frequency, is implemented. This controller changes the incoming DC voltage into an AC voltage of a variable frequency and RMS amplitude. The disadvantages of switching inverters, compared to a pure sine wave source, are the harmonics they inject in both the output as in the input of the inverters connection. At the incoming power line, {{it is necessary to}} damp these harmonics, in order to avoid resonance issues or issues regarding other systems, for instance, train detection. For this purpose of harmonic and transient filtering, generated within as well as outside the train, an LC filter is utilised. However, this LC-filter has also influence on stability. Due to the resulting impedance to current variation in the inductance of the LC-filter, the power flow dynamics towards the train are decreased. When applying a certain amount of power, the voltage over the capacitance can become unstable very quickly. In this thesis, a graphical user interface simulation model is made to simulate these stability phenomena in Simulink in order to find the optimum size of the LC-filter in a train on the Dutch DC railway. The simulations are achieved with a model representing a generalised train. The model is simple to modify, and consists of the important parts for determining the stability of the system. Different simulations have been carried out, in order to examine the effect certain parameter variations have on the stability. Two systems have been considered, a constant power controlled system and a system where the motors had no controlling regime. An important factor is the value of the capacitance and inductance. A larger filter inductor results in an unstable system. Likewise, implementing a higher value capacitance will cause the system to be more stable. Simulations have shown that a motor controller with a simple constant power control regime is unstable with normal values for the inductance and capacitance. However a damping branch can solve this problem up to an extent. A system without any controlling regime has proven to be more stable <b>with</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>capacitance.</b> By utilising the model presented in this thesis, the stability of the system, consisting purely of a controlled constant power load or as a non-controlled load, can be investigated, and the impact of the LC-filter can be determined.

40|$|Progress in {{semiconductor}} {{process technology}} has made SOI transistors {{one of the}} most promising candidates for high performance and low power designs. <b>With</b> <b>smaller</b> diffusion <b>capacitances,</b> SOI transistors switch significantly faster than their traditional bulk MOS counterparts and consume less power per switching. However, design and simulation of SOI MOS circuits is more challenging due to more complex behavior of an SOI transistor involving floating body effects, delay dependence on history of transistor switching, bipolar effect and others. This paper is devoted to developing a fast table model of SOI transistors, suitable for use in fast transistor level simulators. We propose using body charge instead of body potential as an independent variable of the model to improve convergence of circuit simulation integration algorithm. SOI transistor has one additional terminal compared with the bulk MOSFET and hence requires larger tables to model. We propose a novel transformation to reduce number of table dimensions and as a result to make the size of the tables reasonable. The paper also presents efficient implementation of our SOI transistor table model using piece-wise polynomial approximation, nonuniform grid discretization, and splitting the transistor model into the model of its equilibrium and non equilibrium states. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by employing it in a fast transistor level simulator to simulate high performance industrial SOI microprocessor circuits. ...|$|R
