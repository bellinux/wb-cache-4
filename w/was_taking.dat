40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of oral {{contraceptives}} on anticoagulant treatment the prothrombin times of 12 patients were measured while they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> both drugs simultaneously and while they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> only anticoagulants. The mean prothrombin time ratio was significantly higher when patients <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> both drugs than when they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> only anticoagulants and their doses of anticoagulant were significantly lower. During both periods most of the prothrombin values remained in the therapeutic range. These findings suggest that, contrary to the common belief that oral contraceptives diminish {{the effects of}} anticoagulants, contraceptives in fact potentiate {{the action of the}} anticoagulants...|$|R

30|$|Most of the 97 {{patients}} {{without a}} stable drug combination <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> drugs but with less consistency. Only 26 patients took no drugs for ≥ 50 % days.

Of the 69, 14 (20.3 %) <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> any antipsychotic for ≥ 90 % of days, but this reflected {{the sum of}} days taking different antipsychotics. Patients without a stable drug combination also had twice as many daily changes in drugs taken than those with a stable combination (16 versus 8 changes per year, p < 0.001).|$|R
5000|$|The above {{two forms}} can be combined, to {{indicate}} a present or past view of a prior (or prior and current) event that occurred with stative or progressive aspect ("I have/had been feeling well," [...] "I have/had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes"); here the construction is [...] "have/has/had" [...] + [...] "been" [...] + main verb + -"ing". There is a subtle difference in usage between the case where the viewpoint is from {{the present and the}} case where it is from a point in the past: have <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes implies that the action is not only of present relevance but is continuing to occur; in contrast, had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes indicates present relevance, allows but does not require the action to still be occurring (I had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes but <b>was</b> not still doing so; I had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes and still was).|$|R

5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> time to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E

In storyline, on the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Massaro {{was attacked by}} Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a screw in her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted her.

The death toll of the march is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E

A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E

5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain the upper hand during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E

While the newest appeal <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

The Senate Judiciary Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation. Williams had also indiscreetly used Justice Department funds to pay for carriage and household expenses.|$|E
