5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the predictive power of weather for electricity prices in day-ahead markets in real time. We find that next-day <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> improve the forecast accuracy of day-ahead electricity prices substantially, suggesting that <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> can price the weather premium.

5|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> of wind, {{precipitations}} {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires.

Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.|$|E
5|$|Weather is {{a chaotic}} {{system that is}} readily {{modified}} by small changes to the environment, so accurate <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is limited to only a few days.

However, online operation of load forecasting models requires the use of <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts,</b> with associated <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> errors. A technique is proposed to model <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> errors to reflect current accuracy. A load forecasting model is then proposed which combines the forecasts of several load forecasting models. This approach allows the relationship between weather and load to be determined without <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> error. The effect of the <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> error is then minimised during the combination stage...|$|R

5|$|Ancient <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> methods usually {{relied on}} {{observed}} patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, {{it might be}} observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{research}} activity {{supported by the}} Advanced Research Project Agency, Project BATON sought to expand understanding of storm physics {{as an aid to}} <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting,</b> fire prevention, and, possibly, for artificially controlling the weather.

5|$|For over a century, {{reports from}} the world's oceans have been {{received}} real-time for safety reasons and to help with general <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> The reports are coded using the synoptic code, and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location. Larger moored buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used farther out at sea.|$|E
40|$|The {{indoor climate}} of many storage {{facilities}} for agricultural produce {{is controlled by}} mixing ambient air with the air flow through the store room. Hence, the indoor climate {{is affected by the}} ambient weather conditions. Given hourly fluctuating energy tariffs, <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> over some days are required to effectively anticipate. Hence, typically a real-time optimal control strategy results. As <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> are uncertain, predicted model outputs and related costs of the control strategy become uncertain. Usually, a medium-range <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> for a period of some days consists of an ensemble of forecasts. Hence, the uncertainty in the <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> is known a priori. In addition to this, in past-performance studies where <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> and observed <b>weather</b> variables are given, an a posteriori evaluation of the forecast errors can be made as well. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the uncertainty in the costs related to <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> errors and uncertainty, given the control inputs. In a simulation case-study with real <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> and observed <b>weather,</b> it appeared that only slight cost increases can be expected due to errors and uncertainties in <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> if the optimal control problem is calculated every 6 – 12 h in a receding horizon contex...|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting,</b> as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{jet stream}} moves from West to East {{bringing}} changes of weather. Meteorologists now {{understand that the}} path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become {{an important part of}} <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding {{as a result of the}} polar jet staying south for the summer.|$|E

5|$|The two men {{credited}} {{with the birth of}} forecasting as a science were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy.

5|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is the {{application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about {{the current state of the}} atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.|$|E

5|$|A {{major part}} of modern <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> is the severe weather alerts and {{advisories}} that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected.

Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|However, {{according}} to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, {{a rise in the}} market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.
