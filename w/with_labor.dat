5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage.

Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly <b>with</b> <b>Labor</b> support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the bacterial flora of women in preterm <b>labor</b> <b>with</b> or without premature rupture of membranes. Methods: Retrospective studies of 239 patients <b>with</b> preterm <b>labor</b> were performed. Results: One hundred and twenty-three of 239 patients <b>with</b> preterm <b>labor</b> (51. 5 %) had bacterial vaginosis. Seventy of the 239 patients <b>with</b> preterm <b>labor</b> (29. 3 %) developed premature rupture of the membranes (preterm PROM). Of the 70 patients with preterm PROM, 51 (72. 9 %) had bacterial vaginosis. Therefore, 51 of the 123 patients with bacterial vaginosis (41. 5 %) developed preterm PROM. An increased number of organisms detected from the vaginal discharge in patients <b>with</b> preterm <b>labor</b> was associated <b>with</b> preterm PROM by Cochran-Armitage test. An increased number of organisms detected from the vaginal discharge in patients <b>with</b> preterm <b>labor</b> complicated <b>with</b> bacterial vaginosis was significantly associated with preterm PROM by Cochran-Armitage test.

5|$|To face an {{opposition}} that was becoming uncooperative {{was not what}} Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle.

The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E

5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} <b>with</b> <b>labor</b> became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} <b>with</b> <b>Labor</b> leaders {{more than}} attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent a}} Confederate force from {{advancing}} on Washington along the Potomac, several forts were constructed on hills near the river. To guard River Road, {{which was the}} most direct route into the city, U.S. Army engineers built a small, round fort {{at the point where}} River Road crossed into the district of Columbia. With a perimeter of only 123 yards and mounting only six guns, it was located forward of Fort Reno, the largest fort protecting the Tenleytown area. Details of the actual construction process are scarce, though a letter from a member of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery regiment to the Democratic Press newspaper indicates that the fort was at least partially built <b>with</b> <b>labor</b> from that regiment.|$|E

5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement blocked off. They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping <b>with</b> <b>Labor</b> 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock.|$|E
5|$|To dispel {{concerns}} {{about his age}} (74), failing eyesight, and heart problems, Barkley arrived in Chicago for the 1952 Democratic National Convention and briskly walked seven blocks from the bus station to his campaign headquarters. The attempt was rendered moot on July 20 {{when a group of}} labor leaders, including United Automobile Workers President Walter Reuther, issued a statement calling Barkley too old and requesting that Democrats nominate someone younger like Stevenson. At a meeting <b>with</b> <b>labor</b> leaders the next morning, Barkley failed to persuade them to retract the statement, which caused delegations from large industrial states like Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to waver on their commitments to Barkley. On July 21, he announced his withdrawal from the race. Invited to make a farewell address on July 22, he received a 35-minute ovation when he took the podium and 45-minute one at the speech's end. In a show of respect, a Missouri delegate nominated Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack seconded it, but Stevenson was easily nominated. A month after the convention, Barkley hosted a Stevenson picnic and campaign rally at his home in Paducah and later introduced him at a rally in Louisville. Despite Barkley's predictions of a Democratic victory, Stevenson lost in overwhelming fashion to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.|$|E
