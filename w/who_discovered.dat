5|$|Both Ariel and the {{slightly}} larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, {{claimed to have}} observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, {{for which he}} was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Aziz Sancar, a Turkish {{professor}} at the University of North Carolina, won the Nobel Chemistry Prize along with Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich, for their work on how cells repair damaged DNA.

5|$|In a 1988 Young All-Stars {{comic book}} written by Roy and Dann Thomas, Arthur Gordon Pym is a 19th-century {{explorer}} <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the lost Arctic civilization {{of the alien}} Dyzan. Pym goes on to become Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, eventually sinking the RMS Titanic. This story also uses elements of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1871 novel Vril.|$|E
5|$|The {{names that}} {{eventually}} prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the moons independently {{at the same}} time as Galileo: he named them at the suggestion of Johannes Kepler after lovers of the god Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter): Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, in his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614.|$|E

5|$|The surname Golding {{is synonymous}} {{with a variety of}} hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it is not certain <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died some time before 1811), the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E
5|$|Thomson's {{plum pudding}} model was disproved in 1909 {{by one of}} his former students, Ernest Rutherford, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> that most of the mass and {{positive}} charge of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.|$|E

5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E

Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{the center}} of European chess life moved from the Southern European {{countries}} to France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834. Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in big European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson's Divan in London.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century it was {{successively}} {{the home}} of the notable scientists Dr William Budd FRS, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the origins of typhoid, and Professor John Beddoe FRS, the social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. In the 1890s the house became a school preparing young gentlemen for colonial civil service examinations and for the army and navy. The school closed in 1915 and the house became {{the home of}} The Red Maids' School, which was evacuated from Westbury while their buildings were used as a Red Cross Hospital during the Great War.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed {{from the family}} name of Roberto Abel, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> Abelisaurus, {{as well as from}} the Greek word σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of B.menziesii {{were first}} {{collected}} by the botanist Charles Fraser during Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling's March 1827 exploration of the Swan River. The following year, Alexander Macleay sent some of Fraser's specimens to Robert Brown. Brown formally published the species in his 1830 Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae, giving it the specific epithet in honor of Archibald Menzies, surgeon-naturalist on the HMS Discovery under George Vancouver, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> King George Sound in 1791. Thus the species' full name is Banksia menziesii R.Br. Neither Brown nor Menzies ever saw the plant growing.|$|E

5|$|The Lassell ring, {{also known}} as the plateau, is the {{broadest}} ring in the Neptunian system. It is the namesake of William Lassell, the English astronomer <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> Neptune's largest moon, Triton. This ring is a faint sheet of material occupying the space between the Le Verrier ring at about 53,200km and the Arago ring at 57,200km. Its average normal optical depth is around 10−4, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4km. The ring's dust fraction is in the range from 20% to 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> the blood circulatory system. The hospital was built because the government decided the old hospital would be too small for demand as Ashford grew, and looked for a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E
