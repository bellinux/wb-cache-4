5|$|As {{a result}} of the money <b>Workman</b> left in her will, Wellesley College offers a $16,000 {{fellowship}} named after Fanny <b>Workman</b> for graduate study in any discipline to a Wellesley graduate each year. Bryn Mawr established a Fanny Bullock <b>Workman</b> Traveling Fellowship, which is awarded to Ph.D candidates in Archaeology or Art History when funds permit.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, <b>Workman</b> was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter <b>Workman</b> cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny <b>Workman</b> traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny <b>Workman</b> was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and <b>Workman</b> saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Fanny {{returned}} to the United States and on June 16, 1882 married William Hunter <b>Workman,</b> a man 12 years her senior. He was also from a wealthy and educated family, having attended Yale and having received his medical training at Harvard. In 1884 they had a daughter, Rachel.|$|E

She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
50|$|Groenten uit Balen {{is based}} upon real events {{which took place in}} the Belgian {{community}} Balen. In 1971 it turned out the <b>workmen</b> of Vieille Montagne in the other Belgian plants had a much higher salary for similar work. The workers in Balen wanted a raise. This led to a dispute between the <b>workmen,</b> the trade unions and the directors board. The 1500 <b>workmen</b> in Balen went on a strike, but this was not accepted by the trade unions. As a result, the <b>workmen</b> did not earn any money at all. The strike went on for 9 weeks. Many charity was set up by inhabitants of Mol and Balen. Jef Sleeckx, a politician, convinced the banks to cancel payments temporarily for affected <b>workmen.</b> Houselords did not ask rent during the strike.

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, <b>Workman</b> was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 LeMessurier and Hills {{published}} A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggests that decompression by conventional models forms bubbles that are then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops—which is slower than elimination while still in solution. This indicates the importance of minimizing bubble phase for efficient gas elimination, Groupe d'Etudes et Recherches Sous-marines published the French Navy MN65 decompression tables, and Goodman and <b>Workman</b> introduced re-compression tables using oxygen to accelerate elimination of inert gas.|$|E

They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E

Both Pistolero and Dog in the Sand were produced by Nick Vincent.|$|E
5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, {{primarily because of the}} onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny <b>Workman</b> became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing them on the title pages of her books.|$|E

5|$|At 11:30am, March 27, {{recognizing}} {{his description}} from a newspaper story, the engineer and brakeman of a train, from Philadelphia to Jersey City, crossing the Hackensack Bridge, spotted Jackalow running towards the woods. First two, then eight, New Jersey police officers {{went into the}} woods after him. Around noon, Jackalow was turned away from crossing a railroad bridge, then under construction in Newark, New Jersey, by <b>workman</b> William Jacobus, who recognized Jackalow. His colleague Henry Wilson mentioned a $1000 reward for Jackalow's arrest, and the pair—joined by John Sanford and John Douglass, and aided by a spy glass—spotted Jackalow heading for the Newark Plank Road. Jacobus and Douglass pursued Jackalow, while Wilson and Sanford took the car to Newark, hired a horse, {{and set out to}} intercept him on the road.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle <b>Workman</b> on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a <b>workman.</b> The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good <b>workman,</b> and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Local {{shipping}} {{accidents are}} among {{the responsibilities of the}} Phoenix. In September 1965, the Norwegian freighter MS Berganger collided with the tanker Independent, resulting in fires aboard the ships. Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter's blaze, but the tanker took longer to extinguish. A year later, a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore. While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating, the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby <b>workman.</b> Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries, and fought to snuff the blaze. Flaming, floating gasoline proved difficult to subdue. In December 2011, a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove, and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew.|$|E
