After describing Gehrig as [...] "the finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known", McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, the manager said, [...] "Lou, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> say except that it was a sad {{day in the life of}} everybody who knew you when you came into my hotel room that day in Detroit and told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team.

Nora read the letter, and then asked her sister what she meant to do. [...] "I have written to Mrs. Peacock. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do.

[...] He kissed her tenderly and put her from him. He looked at Sylvia {{standing}} beside her and at Tremayne beyond the table. [...] "Comfort her," [...] he implored them, and, turning, went out quickly.|$|E
6000|$|When in London for my play I {{had asked}} news from {{an actor who}} had seen him constantly. [...] "He is in deep melancholy," [...] was the answer.

'Christ came from a white plain to a purple city, and as he passed through the first street, he heard voices overhead, and saw a young man lying drunk upon a window sill, [...] "Why do you waste your soul in drunkenness?"

6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} how {{to thank you for}} your kindness, of which I gladly avail myself. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, as <b>I</b> wish to meet Mr. Caswall of Castra Regis, who arrives home from Africa to-day.

[...] "You must be Mr. Adam Salton of Lesser Hill. I am Lady Arabella March of Diana's Grove." [...] As she spoke she turned slightly to Mr. Salton, who took the hint and made a formal introduction.|$|R

6000|$|The {{magnificent}} {{plan of the}} Chief Forester (to {{which he}} had pledged such buoyant allegiance) was now a thing apart, a campaign {{in which he was}} to be merely an onlooker.

He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|R
