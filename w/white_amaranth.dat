40|$|A {{field survey}} of heavy metal {{concentrations}} in soils and vegetables grown in 30 vegetable farmlands of Hangzhou City were carried out. Through calculating the bioconcentration factor(BCF) and transfer factor(TF) for different heavy metals(Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb) in 27 {{kinds of different}} vegetables which belong to leafy vegetables, root vegetables or eggplant fruit vegetables, assessing their accumulation characteristics of heavy metals according to the differences of the bio-concentration factor, the reasonable proposals were put forward to optimize the planting structure of vegetables in mild and middle-level heavy metal contamination soils. The experimental results were as follows: In soils with mild and middle-level heavy metal contamination, leafy vegetables, such as crown daisy, cabbage, celery and Chinese long cabbage, had relatively low enrichment ability of heavy metals, so as the root and fruit vegetables like white radish, carrot, tomatoes, hence these vegetables could be planted preferentially. In contrast, some kinds of vegetables, including <b>white</b> <b>amaranth,</b> red amaranth, tatsoi, broccoli, gynura, brassica juncea and lettuce of leafy vegetables, lactuca sativa, taro, red radish and cherry radish of rhizome vegetables and sweet pepper of fruit vegetables, had relatively high accumulation ability of heavy metal, which should be avoided to be planted in soils with mild and middle-level heavy metal contamination...|$|E

The town's local musical band was formed in 1906, and still is involved in several local events. In addition, the A.S. societ√† sportiva San Damiano-Sant'Albino, whose colors are <b>white</b> and <b>amaranth,</b> is found in this town.|$|R
50|$|The {{everyday}} {{dress of}} Latin Church bishops may {{consist of a}} black (or, in tropical countries, <b>white)</b> cassock with <b>amaranth</b> trim and purple fascia, along with a pectoral cross and episcopal ring. The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that the dress for ordinary use may instead be a simple cassock without coloured trim. Since 1969, a black suit and clerical shirt, already customary in English-speaking countries, has become very common also in countries where previously it was unknown.|$|R
