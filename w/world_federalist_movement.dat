25|$|Ustinov was the President of the <b>World</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> from 1991 to 2004, {{the time}} of his death. WFM is a global NGO that {{promotes}} the concept of global democratic institutions. WFM lobbies those in powerful positions to establish a unified human government based on democracy and civil society. The United Nations and other world agencies would become the institutions of a World Federation. The UN would be the federal government and nation states would become similar to provinces.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{opposition}} arose to {{the idea}} of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the <b>World</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary. In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Allmand defended a legal argument, {{on behalf}} of the <b>World</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement</b> – Canada, that {{challenged}} the Canadian government's implementation bill for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He argued that a clause of the bill was flawed and enabled use of cluster munitions while Canada was participating in combined military operations with allies. Participating in use was a violation of the primary purposes of the convention. Allmand preferred not signing the treaty than passing a flawed version that with a loophole that other countries could also adopt to circumvent its terms.|$|E
500|$|Progressives welcomed {{these new}} {{international}} organizations and {{regimes in the}} aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued that they suffered from a democratic deficit and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another global war but to foster global justice. The United Nations was designed in 1945 by US bankers and State Department planners, and was always intended to remain a free association of sovereign nation-states, not a transition to democratic world government. Thus, activists around the globe formed a <b>world</b> <b>federalist</b> <b>movement,</b> hoping in vain to create a [...] "real" [...] new world order.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October 1945, {{before the}} UN Charter had even entered into force, retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts and former New Hampshire Governor Robert P. Bass held {{a conference in}} Dublin, New Hampshire, which passed the Dublin Declaration. It stated that the UN Charter was {{inadequate}} to preserve peace and proposed {{the transformation of the}} U.N. General Assembly into a world legislature, opining, [...] "Such a government should be based upon a constitution under which all peoples and nations will participate upon a basis of balanced representation which will take account of natural and industrial resources and other factors as well as population. It cannot be based on treaties...in which the states...act and vote as states". It called for [...] "limited but definite and adequate power for the prevention of war." [...] Grenville Clark and other participants in the Dublin conference went on to become active in the United World Federalists (UWF) and the global <b>World</b> <b>Federalist</b> <b>Movement.</b> UWF enjoyed some success in the postwar period, as 23 state legislatures passed bills supporting the organization’s goals, but McCarthyism prompted many prominent members to resign lest Senator Joseph McCarthy ruin their careers. In the United States, internationalism came to be associated with communism.|$|E
