They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft cambial tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) suffer the greatest damage.|$|R

Fistulina is a cyphelloid genus, meaning that it {{is closely related to}} gilled fungi, but its fertile surface consists of smooth cup-shaped elements instead of gills.

5|$|Pholiota flammans, {{commonly}} known as the yellow pholiota, the flaming Pholiota, or the flame scalecap, is a basidiomycete <b>agaric</b> <b>mushroom</b> of the genus Pholiota. Its fruit body is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its cap and stem are covered in sharp scales. As it is a saprobic fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the stumps of dead coniferous trees. P.flammans is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in boreal and temperate regions. Its edibility has not been clarified.|$|R
50|$|She {{was hired}} as a curator at the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo in 1967, and was {{promoted}} to professor in 2001. She retired in the autumn of 2006. A replacement curator has not been found as of early 2009. Gulden has published several books, both academic, popular and for children. Her research has been focused largely on the taxonomy of <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> especially the Tricholomataceae family and the genus Galerina. She also has published several articles about alpine and arctic macromycetes.|$|R
5000|$|DNA {{sequencing}} confirms this diversity, {{showing that}} cyphelloid fungi have independently evolved {{at least eight}} times within the Basidiomycota. Genera are currently placed in the Cyphellaceae (in a restricted sense), Inocybaceae, Marasmiaceae, Niaceae, and Tricholomataceae. It had previously been suggested that most cyphelloid fungi were related to gilled <b>agarics</b> (<b>mushrooms</b> and toadstools) and they have sometimes {{been referred to as}} [...] "reduced agarics". DNA sequencing shows that this is indeed true for many of the genera sampled, almost all being placed within the order Agaricales.|$|R

The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes.

50|$|Muskeg {{consists}} of dead plants {{in various states}} of decomposition (as peat), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum moss, to sedge peat, to highly decomposed humus. Pieces of wood can make up five to 15 percent of the peat soil. Muskeg tends to have a water table near the surface. The sphagnum moss forming it can hold 15 to 30 times its own weight in water, allowing the spongy wet muskeg to form on sloping ground. Muskeg patches are ideal habitats for beavers, pitcher plants, <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms</b> {{and a variety of other}} organisms.|$|R
5|$|The genus {{once served}} as a {{wastebasket}} taxon for many <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms</b> with a <b>white</b> spore print, gills attached to the stem, and an annulus. Due largely to differing interpretations on {{the limits of the}} genus, over 270 species and varieties have been placed in Armillaria or its synonym Armillariella. A comprehensive 1995 study by Tom Volk and Harold Burdsall evaluated all of the epithets that have been used in Armillaria or Armillariella. They determined that about 40 species belong to Armillaria sensu stricto (in the strict sense); the remaining names belong to species that are distributed among 43 other modern fungal genera.|$|R
50|$|Although {{morphology}} of {{the mushroom}} or fruit body (basidiocarp) {{was the basis}} of early classification of the Agaricomycetes, {{this is no longer}} the case. As an example, the distinction between the Gasteromycetes (including puffballs) and Agaricomycetes (most other <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms)</b> is no longer recognized as a natural one‚Äîvarious puffball species have apparently evolved independently from agaricomycete fungi. However, most mushroom guide books still group the puffballs or gasteroid forms separate from other mushrooms because the older Friesian classification is still convenient for categorizing fruit body forms. Similarly, modern classifications divide the gasteroid order Lycoperdales between Agaricales and Phallales.|$|R

2500|$|Ethnobotanical and ethnomycological {{scholars}} such as R. Gordon Wasson, Carl Ruck and Clark Heinrich {{write that}} the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the entheogenic Amanita muscaria (or fly <b>agaric)</b> <b>mushroom.</b> [...] Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms. At times artists would co-opt the apple, {{as well as other}} religious symbology, whether for ironic effect or as a stock element of symbolic vocabulary. Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as symbol of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with Venus who is shown holding it.|$|R
50|$|SOMAThe {{exhibition}} Soma {{was installed}} at the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin in 2010. Its main element were 12 reindeer in two pens running {{the length of the}} former railway station. Half of the reindeer were fed the fly <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in their food, which are part of their customary diet in the wild, and turn their urine into a hallucinogen. The reindeer urine was collected by handlers and then stored in on-site refrigerators for use. The experiment was extended to canaries, which were housed in two hanging cage pieces, to mice, and to flies. A mushroom-shaped Elevator Bed was installed {{in the middle of the}} space, and visitors could spend the night on the premise for a fee.|$|R

50|$|Motifs from Mesopotamian mythology {{are widely}} {{represented}} in the book by various references, symbolic coincidences and the final denouement. The most prominent image is the one of Ishtar - goddess, feminine origin related to Venus. It's the most constant and significant theme, the rest appears as a support for it. The idea beneath the motif of Mesopotamian Mythology seem to serve the purpose of deification of advertising as {{in the end the}} most powerful media corporation appears to be a Chaldean Guild sustaining (preserving) the balance between good and evil by means of deft informational manipulations. Tatarsky's experimenting with fly <b>agaric</b> <b>mushrooms</b> (Amanita muscaria species) that give him creative inspiration also has mythological background - fly <b>agarics</b> are sacred <b>mushrooms</b> of Ishtar, consequently it looks like the goddess inspires him. Tatarsky's name also bears a sign of symbolism - Vavilen, apart from being an acronym from the names of Vasily Aksyonov and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, can also be interpreted as a variation of the word Babylon, or Vavilon in Russian.|$|R
