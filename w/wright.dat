5|$|In 1914 while {{designing}} the residence {{after the first}} devastating fire, <b>Wright</b> received a sympathetic letter from Miriam Noel, a fan of his architecture. <b>Wright</b> exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. <b>Wright</b> was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with <b>Wright.</b> Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, meaning that <b>Wright</b> could marry Noel a year later. Although <b>Wright</b> admired Noel's erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as schizophrenia) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin. They married in November, 1923, but Noel left <b>Wright</b> {{by the spring of}} 1924.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wright</b> {{was deeply}} in debt {{following}} {{the destruction of}} Taliesin II. Aside from debts owed on the property, his divorce from Noel forced <b>Wright</b> to sell much of his farm machinery and livestock. <b>Wright</b> was also forced to sell his prized Japanese prints at half value to pay his debts. The Bank of Wisconsin foreclosed on Taliesin in 1927 and <b>Wright</b> was forced to move to La Jolla, California. Shortly before the bank was to begin an auction on the property, Wright's former client Darwin Martin conceived a scheme to save the property. He formed a company called Frank Lloyd <b>Wright</b> Incorporated to issue stock on Wright's future earnings. Many of Wright's former clients and students purchased stock in <b>Wright</b> to raise $70,000. The company successfully bid on Taliesin for $40,000, returning it to <b>Wright.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd <b>Wright</b> {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, <b>Wright</b> had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, <b>Wright</b> began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. <b>Wright</b> and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where <b>Wright</b> made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, <b>Wright</b> {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but {{with support from the}} small Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: <b>Wright</b> ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. <b>Wright</b> proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not a gift from the state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, <b>Wright,</b> like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E
