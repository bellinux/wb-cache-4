50|$|In {{the same}} way Radha-kunda and Shyama-kunda {{are the same as}} Radha Krishna, so Lalita's kunda is her liquid form.

"My first {{steamboat}} on the Hudson's River was 150 feet long, 13 feet wide, drawing 2 ft. of <b>water,</b> <b>bow</b> {{and stern}} 60 degrees: she displaced 36.40 sic cubic feet, equal 100 tons of water; her bow presented 26 ft. to the water, plus and minus {{the resistance of}} 1 ft. running 4 miles an hour." ...|$|R

60|$|This image Kari washed {{before he}} touched himself with <b>water,</b> <b>bowing</b> to it the while, {{and when he}} saw me observing him, looked upwards to the sky and said a word that sounded like Pachacamac, from which I took it to be some idol that the poor man worshipped.

60|$|The girl felt it all {{as no one}} {{native to}} the sea can {{possibly}} do. It {{seemed as if the}} bounds of the flood had been overcome, and that it was about to hurl itself upon the land. The slender trees, standing deep in the swash of <b>water,</b> <b>bowed</b> like women in pain; the wall was half hidden, and the flood and the land seemed mingled in battle.|$|R
5|$|With two holds rapidly {{filling with}} <b>water,</b> the <b>bow</b> submerges {{and the ship}} quickly sinks, leaving little time for the crew to react.|$|R
50|$|Within seconds, Choppers angle {{increased}} to 45° down and her bow passed 440 ft of depth. Because {{of the power}} loss, the Officer of the Deck was unable {{to communicate with the}} Senior Controllerman in Maneuvering room, but the senior man in the Maneuvering Room independently ordered both main motors back full. Despite the backing bell, blowing ballast, and other efforts to regain control of the submarine, the down angle continued to increase, and within one minute of the power failure, Chopper was nearly vertical in the <b>water,</b> <b>bow</b> down. Choppers bow is estimated to have reached a depth of 1011 ft, her stern reaching 720 ft.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 July 1975, Ader {{set off in}} a 13 ft {{modified}} “Guppy 13” pocket cruiser named Ocean Wave, to {{make his}} single-handed west-east crossing of the North Atlantic. He estimated that the voyage should take him some {{two and a half}} months. His unmanned boat was found nine months after he had set sail, floating nearly vertically in the <b>water,</b> <b>bow</b> down, 200 nautical miles (360 km's) due west of Land's End, 100 nautical miles SW of Ireland. Ocean Wave was found by Spanish fishermen who took her to La Coruña from where she was stolen somewhere between 18 May and 7 June 1976.|$|R

50|$|In 2005, Bow kites (also {{known as}} flat LEI kites) were {{developed}} with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and frequently a bridle along the leading edge. These features allow the kite's {{angle of attack}} to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the <b>water.</b> <b>Bow</b> kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most LEI kite manufacturers developed {{a variation of the}} bow kite by 2006.|$|R

50|$|The crew’s efforts {{began to}} take effect. Chopper lost the headway that was taking her deeper, and even began to make sternway. Her bow began to rise, reached level, and {{continued}} to climb. Chopper began to ascend with a rapidly increasing up-angle until she was again nearly vertical in the <b>water,</b> now <b>bow</b> up.|$|R

500|$|The ship is {{included}} on the Chatham Naval Memorial; her wreck is [...] southwest of the Isle of Portland at [...] in [...] of <b>water.</b> Her <b>bow</b> is blown off forward of the engine rooms and her stern section is upright and reasonably intact. The wreck site is designated as a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986.|$|R
50|$|Strainers and sieves {{can pose}} a {{particular}} hazard. If the sieve is visible above water, a boater can be pinned {{against it and}} may eventually be forced underwater as the current passes through. If the sieve is completely submerged, it is especially insidious because {{it may not be}} discernible at all. In shallow <b>water,</b> <b>bows</b> of boats can get caught in submerged sieves, as the current pulls the nose down below the rocks where it can lodge. If this happens, {{it is likely that the}} whole boat will get pulled under water. Sieves pose a particular hazard to swimmers because even the smallest sieves can trap a person's foot if they stand up in the current. The force of the current then pushes the whole body underwater, becoming a deadly situation in a matter of seconds. It is for this reason that one of the first things whitewater boaters learn is never to stand up in more than ankle deep water where there is a current.|$|R

50|$|In {{incompressible}} fluids (liquids) such as <b>water,</b> a <b>bow</b> wake {{is created}} when a watercraft {{moves through the}} medium; as the medium cannot be compressed, it must be displaced instead, resulting in a wave. As with all wave forms, it spreads outward from the source until its energy is overcome or lost, usually by friction or dispersion. The non-dimensional parameter of interest is the Froude number.|$|R
500|$|Six [...] torpedo tubes were {{initially}} fitted. Two each were above <b>water</b> in the <b>bow</b> and stern {{and one was}} on each broadside underwater. The above-water tubes were removed during a refit in 1906.|$|R
