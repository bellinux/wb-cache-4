While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought it would be fun to make him save the world instead.

The idea of the letter's concealment in yarn is also mentioned by James Boswell in his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1785). However, Macaulay states that this method for the delivery of the letter(s) has [...] "no basis in reality" [...] and that both letters were smuggled off Hirta by Roderick MacLennan, the island's minister.

We determined the displacement of the brain surface between two T 1 -weighted MRI images obtained at baseline and after a median follow-up time of 2. 2 years for 79 recently diagnosed, mildly disabled MS patients. Voxel- and cluster-wise permutation-based statistics were used to identify brain regions in which atrophy development was significantly related to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed Walk Test (TWT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and 9 -Hole Peg Test (HPT). Clusters were considered significant at a corrected cluster-wise p-value of 0. 05. <b>Worse</b> EDSS change-score <b>and</b> <b>worse</b> follow-up EDSS were related to atrophy development of periventricular and brainstem regions and right-sided parietal, occipital <b>and</b> temporal regions. <b>Worse</b> PASAT at follow-up was significantly related to atrophy of the ventricles.

Historians, such as Edmund Fung, argue that establishing a democracy in China at that time was not possible. The nation was at war and divided between Communists and Nationalists. Corruption within the government and lack of direction also prevented any significant reform from taking place.

2500|$|While BMX Action's {{deliberate}} boycott was damaging, {{it was not}} {{the only}} reason the ABA was receiving reduce coverage in the BMX press, including in BMX Action's biggest competitors BMX Plus! and Super BMX. Many ABA nationals coincided with important NBL nationals and considering there was an informal pro boycott of ABA nationals with the most prominent pros competing in the NBL and second tier sanctioning bodies like the United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and with those races were often scheduled on the same weekend as ABA events, the press followed. This led to a further decrease in coverage with the ABA events only getting one page, half page or even just a blurb in the [...] "Breaking News" [...] section of a major BMX publication, for instance BMX Plus! 's [...] "Check Point", which as previously mentioned due to lack of top pros at ABA events did not cover any ABA races in depth for eight months. The BMX industry noticed this of course. In consequence, there were fewer BMX and non-BMX companies willing to sponsor, i.e. invest in, ABA events with the fewer direct and indirect advertising possibilities like a race team and/or particular racer they were sponsoring having a win reported in detail or even a company banner appearing in the background of a photograph by happenstance that would be printed in a major BMX magazine. Those companies could not only stop sponsoring and co-sponsoring ABA races, but also stop sending their expensive race teams to ABA Nationals. Also, the rank and file non-sponsored BMX racers-the vast majority-could stop attending ABA events if they perceive a lack of press coverage and a lack of big name pros and amateurs they wanted to see and race against stop participating. The in house ABA Action newspaper was not enough since it was restricted to ABA members and therefore it had a limited audience in comparison to a newsstand magazine. The obvious solution afforded to the ABA was to create its own magazine. In 1982 Mennenga created Bicycles and Dirt to circumvent the established press and attract advertisers. The first issue of Bicycles and Dirt or BAD, premiered with the September 1982 issue. Contrary to Mennenga's expectations, advertisers did not flock to the new magazine, despite its built in audience. Like the newspaper ABA Action it was a subscription only magazine at the time. With this in mind the ABA put BAD on newsstands a year after its premier with Stu Thomsen on the cover of its September issue. It did not change the situation. The financial woes of BAD only grew <b>worse</b> <b>and</b> <b>worse.</b> However, instead of cutting one's losses after a few issues as most publishers would do, Mennenga continued to throw good money after bad and pump ABA funds into the ill-conceived and ill-executed venture. Eventually, it became clear to Mennenga that the ABA could not sustain the loss and there was no hope of a turnaround, and an agreement with BMX Action magazine cease publication as a condition to end its editorial boycott he folded Bicycles and Dirt with the September 1984 issue.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Behavioral {{symptoms}} {{are common in}} breast cancer survivors, including disturbances in energy, sleep, and mood, though few risk factors for these negative outcomes have been identified. Our study examined intrusive thoughts {{as a predictor of}} lingering symptoms in breast cancer survivors in the year following treatment. Method: Data come from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational intervention trial, aimed at easing the transition from patient to survivor. Women (n = 558) completed psychosocial questionnaires within 4 weeks posttreatment and again 2, 6, and 12 months later. We examined intrusive thoughts about cancer at the baseline assessment as a predictor of fatigue, sleep problems, pain, breast cancer-specific symptoms, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and quality of life using growth curve modeling, controlling for study condition and other covariates. Results: Intrusive thoughts were associated with higher levels of all symptoms at baseline and at the 12 -month assessment. Intrusive thoughts also influenced the trajectory of pain, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and physical functioning over time; women with higher intrusions at baseline started <b>worse</b> <b>and</b> improved over time, whereas those with lower intrusions remained at a constant, lower level over time. Intrusions were not associated with the trajectory of fatigue, sleep, breast cancer-specific symptoms, or mental functioning; women with higher intrusions at baseline started <b>worse</b> <b>and</b> remained <b>worse</b> over time. Conclusion: Intrusive thoughts are associated with enduring elevations in behavioral symptoms and impaired quality of life in the year after breast cancer treatment and may be a risk factor for poor outcomes. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze whether the {{formally}} equal qualifications acquired during a subsidized vocational education induce equal employment opportunities compared to regular vocational training. Using replacement matching on the basis of a statistical distance function, we are able to control for selection effects resulting from different personal and profession-related characteristics, and thus, to identify an unbiased effect of the public support. Besides the ‘total effect’ of support, it is of special interest if the effect is stronger for subsidized youths in external training compared to persons in workplace-related training. The analysis is based on unique and very detailed data, the Youth Panel of the Halle Centre for Social Research (zsh). The results show that young people who successfully completed a subsidized vocational education are disadvantaged regarding their employment opportunities even when controlling for personal and profession-related influences on the employment prospects. Besides a quantitative effect, the analysis shows that the graduates of subsidized training work in slightly <b>worse</b> (underqualified) <b>and</b> <b>worse</b> paid jobs than the adolescents in the reference group.
