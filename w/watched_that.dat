5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Rock's return {{generated}} {{a lot of}} buzz, an average of 4.7 million people <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> episode of Raw, but 7.4 million tuned in just during The Rock’s promo. His return also led the following episode of Raw on March 7 to be the highest rated episode of that year. In that same year, The Rock wrestled his first match in years at 2011 Survivor Series in Madison Square Garden. The event sold out in less than 90 minutes. The Rock was {{also part of the}} highest rated Raw segment in 2012 in a segment on Raw 1000 with CM Punk and Daniel Bryan which drew a 4.3 rating and was also part of the highest rated overrun of that year (4.4) the same night. The night after the 2013 Royal Rumble on January 28 which saw The Rock win the WWE Championship {{for the first time in}} over a decade was the highest rated Raw episode of that year.|$|E

25|$|All Big Three {{television}} networks and CNN, {{as well as}} local news outlets, interrupted regularly scheduled programming to cover the incident, with an estimated 95 million viewers nationwide; only 90 million had <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> year's Super Bowl. While NBC continued coverage of Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets at Madison Square Garden, the game appeared in a small box in the corner while Tom Brokaw as anchorman covered the chase. The chase was covered live by ABC News anchors Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters on behalf of ABC's five news magazines, which achieved some of their highest-ever ratings that week. Benefiting from the event occurring in the evening, Domino's Pizza stated that its pizza delivery sales during the televised chase were as large as on Super Bowl Sunday.|$|E
500|$|Among the precepts which Itanhaém and Friar Pedro Mariana {{sought to}} instill in Pedro II were: that all human beings should be {{considered}} as his equals, that he should seek to be impartial and just, that public servants and ministers of state should be carefully <b>watched,</b> <b>that</b> he should not have favourites, and that his concern should always be for the public welfare. Both had as an objective [...] "to make a human, honest, constitutional, pacifist, tolerant, wise and just monarch. That is, a perfect ruler, dedicated integrally to his obligations, above political passions and private interests." [...] Later, in January 1839, Itanhaém called Cândido José de Araújo Viana (later Marquis of Sapucaí) to be instructor of Pedro II's education, and he and the emperor also got on very well.|$|E
500|$|Carl's {{relationship}} with Russell reflects how [...] "he's not really {{ready for the}} whirlwind that a kid is, as few of us are". Docter added he saw Up as a [...] "coming of age" [...] tale and an [...] "unfinished love story", with Carl still dealing {{with the loss of}} his wife. He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol, which are both [...] "resurrection" [...] stories about men who lose something, and regain purpose during their journey. Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets, Hayao Miyazaki, Dumbo, and Peter Pan. They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar. There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle. A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo, and Docter <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> film and The Mission for further inspiration. The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn.|$|E

The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just <b>watched</b> <b>that.</b> There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{help define}} the film's look the crew watched period {{films such as}} Sleepy Hollow, Amadeus, Oliver Twist, Barry Lyndon, From Hell, The Elephant Man, Dracula, Brotherhood of the Wolf, Vidocq, and Les Misérables.

[...] "We needed a filthy city to get the real feel for the smells of it", said Griebe.

2500|$|After his release, Peadar Clancy {{started a}} drapery {{business}} of his own, called The Republican Outfitters, which was located at 94 Talbot Street. According to Dan Breen, {{it was one}} of the best-known meeting places in Dublin for the IRA, and was so closely <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> it was never advisable to remain there for long. [...] By 1917, it was advertising as The Republican Outfitters: Clancy, Brennan and Walsh. Clancy's initial partners in the business were Maurice Brennan, Thomas Walsh (who, like Clancy, had been in the Four Courts garrison at Easter 1916, had been sentenced to death, but was later reprieved) and other comrades. [...] By 1920, the initial partnership had been dissolved, Brennan and Walsh had gone out on their own at 5 Upper O'Connell Street (which was also used as a base by the Volunteers, with Walsh acting as intelligence officer of the 1st Battalion) and Tom Hunter had become part proprietor of the Talbot Street business with Clancy.|$|E
2500|$|Testimony {{before the}} British inquiry {{revealed}} that at 10:10p.m., Californian observed {{the lights of}} a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10p.m.) {{that this was a}} passenger liner. At 11:50p.m., the officer had <b>watched</b> <b>that</b> ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible. Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30p.m. and 1:00a.m., but were not acknowledged. [...] If Titanic were as far from the Californian as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. [...] A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact Titanic by that method. [...] Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached Titanic in time to save additional lives.|$|E
