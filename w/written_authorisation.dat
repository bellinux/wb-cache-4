2500|$|Many have {{questioned}} the legality of Elgin's actions, including {{the legitimacy of the}} documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor David Rudenstine of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, [...] "is certainly not established and may well be false". Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads [...] "We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador" [...] but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is [...] "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of [...] "Mr. Philip Hunt" [...] with the initials [...] "N.N." [...] can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman <b>written</b> <b>authorisation</b> for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, [...] "Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had [...] "retained none of them." [...] Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was [...] "Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted to [...] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?" [...] to which Hunt answered [...] "yes", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.|$|E

[...] "I saw the barge--a moving coffin, what?--gliding down stream towed by the galliot and escorted by a small boat. The {{floating}} battery at La Samaritaine challenged her as she passed, for Carrier had prohibited all navigation up or down the Loire until further notice. Foucaud, Lamberty, Fouquet and O'Sullivan the armourer were in the boat: they rowed up to the pontoon and Vailly the chief gunner of the battery challenged them once more. However, they {{had some sort of}} <b>written</b> <b>authorisation</b> from Carrier, for they were allowed to pass. Vailly remained on guard. He saw the barge glide further down stream. It seems that the moon on that time was hidden by a cloud. But the night was not dark and Vailly watched the barge till she was out of sight. She was towed past Trentemoult and Chantenay into the wide reach of the river just below Cheviré where, as you know, the Loire is nearly two thousand feet wide." ...|$|E

The European Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union sets ambitious objectives based on commitments to shared values and effective implementation of political, economic, social and institutional reforms. Concerning the results 12 years after the initiation of Barcelona process, opinions are divided. If Barcelona {{opened the way for}} a series of meetings, seminars and expertise in order to diagnose the Mediterranean situation, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership comes up against small or even insufficient means for the implementation of the objectives set down in Barcelona. There is a long list of problems waiting to be dealt wit. It may be questioned, however, whether the Barcelona process can actually cope with all the challenges and problems affecting in general the Mediterranean region. Above all, can we speak of stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean region as long as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict persists? It is, therefore, necessary to explore where the Partnership went wrong, its insufficiencies and its limitations, and finally {{what can be done to}} revive the Process on its course towards its stated objectives of establishing a common area of peace and stability, shared prosperity, as well as developing human resources, promoting understanding between cultures and exchanges between civil societies...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Section 263 of ITAA 1936 {{is one of}} a raft of {{provisions}} available to the Tax Office empowering it to access buildings and documents. The access powers under s 263 are restricted to access {{for the purposes of the}} income tax legislation. Other statutes administered by the Tax Office contain their own specific access powers. Under s 263, an authorised officer has full and free access to all buildings and documents and may make copies of (but not seize) documents: see [263. 140]. Furthermore, the occupier of any building proposed to be entered must provide reasonable facilities and assistance: see [263. 180]. Notably though, the section imposes no other positive obligations upon an occupier or custodian, particularly there is no obligation to answer questions concerning the affairs of any taxpayer. The occupier or custodian has the right to request the officer to produce a <b>written</b> <b>authorisation</b> before the access can occur: see [263. 120]. This power complements that in s 264 which authorises the Commissioner to require persons to furnish information or attend and give evidence and/or produce books or documents if necessary: see [264. 10]. Neither power is dependent on the other, but it is the policy of the Tax Office to first make informal requests for information and/or documents before exercising either power unless exceptional circumstances exist. Furthermore, the Tax Office will typically liaise with the occupant or custodian as to a convenient time to seek access and will generally seek to access information from taxpayers being investigated before seeking the information from third parties. Persons concerned about breaching any obligation of confidentiality by supplying information to the Tax Office should request that there be either a formal request for access under s 263 or that a s 264 notice be issued to them. The powers granted by s 263 are broad but are not without their limitations and are reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. In particular, an officer exercising the power must be appropriately authorised: see [263. 120]. The power must be exercised bona fide and solely for the purposes of the income tax legislation: see [263. 100]. While it is not subject to any privilege against incrimination (see [263. 820]) or any duty of confidentiality, such power is subject to public interest immunity (see [263. 820]) and to legal professional privilege (see [263. 300]). Where existing litigation has commenced, the Tax Office must use caution in exercising s 263 at the risk of committing a contempt of court: see [263. 880]. Failure to comply with the provision will amount to obstruction under s 149 of the Criminal Code (Cth) with a possible penalty of imprisonment for up to 2 years: see [263. 820]. Suggested steps to adopt for an occupier or custodian who is subject to the exercise by the Tax Office of the powers in s 263 are set out at [263. 800]...|$|E
