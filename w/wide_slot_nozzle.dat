40|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} for reducing the mass and concurrently increasing the strength of metal parts. One is to distribute the material according to the loading of a part. This approach was pursued in the research project "process development of hydropatchwork bonding". In the patchwork technology blanks are reinforced locally in highly stressed areas by bonded sheets (patches) and then formed together as composite. In this project the hydroforming was used as forming technology. The patchwork technology puts specific requirements to the adhesive technology {{as well as to}} the hydroforming process which were specified for the potential application field of car body panels. After selecting suitable adhesive systems, a special bonding technology was developed. This encloses in the first step the locally defined steadily application of highly viscous paste-like adhesives in thin layers, for which a new <b>wide</b> <b>slot</b> <b>nozzle</b> was designed and tested. With the infrared heating by focused, close infrared light, which was used for the first time for these application cases, a technology was used which makes it possible on the one hand to warm up the components partially with one-sided access. On the other hand, it enables a limited precuring of adhesives if needed by the defined input of process heat using a heating regime. During the hydroforming process the adhesive joint has to withstand high loads by shear-, peel- and tensile forces, because it has to transfer the forming stresses from the base plate into the patch. To avoid the destruction of the adhesive joint during the hydroforming process, the forming of the composite has to be limited, a fact that has to be taken into consideration in the component design. Besides, the optimization of the patch geometry by edge relaxation has benefiting effects on the forming of the patchwork-composite. With the tools, developed in this project, it is possible to study and analyse parameters of the forming process of bonded sheets in a small scale, thus saving time and costs for material and machines. Especially when using a counter tool, relevant process conditions that are to be found during the forming of real components can be modelled very easily. For the dimensioning of components the usage of simulation tools was verified exemplarily. Within the scope of the project, methods were developed and devices were created, with which the visco-elastic and visco-plastic specific values of the adhesive layer, necessary for the FE-simulation, are relatively simply determinable with adequate approximation. As a result of this project a FE-model based on a laminate composite was developed, which allows an integration of the forming simulation of bonded patch composites in larger shell structures...|$|E

It can contribute significantly to the understanding of mechanisms involved in flow fields.

The aim of {{this work}} is to {{optimize}} process design parameters of the hot rolling steel strip preposition ultra-fast cooling(UFC) system, and improve the stability and uniformity of micro heat transfer during the high strength cooling process of hot rolling strip. According to the technology and equipment feature of the pre-UFC system for a factory, the convective heat transfer process of single nozzle and strip in UFC system was studied numerically by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method (FEM). The influence of different parameters on the slot impinging jet heat transfer coefficient was obtained, such as jet angle, the jet velocity, the <b>slot</b> <b>nozzle</b> width and water temperature. The results show that on the ultra-fast cooling process of the strip in the initial temperature of 850 oC and thickness of 8 mm, the global average heat transfer coefficient can be increased {{with the increase of}} jet velocity, and decrease of the cooling water temperature.

40|$|NASA has {{conducted}} research programs {{to reduce or}} eliminate the operational restrictions of supersonic aircraft over populated areas. Restrictions are due to the disturbance from the sonic boom, caused by the coalescence of shock waves formed off the aircraft. Results from two-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses (performed on a baseline Mach 2. 0 nozzle in a simulated Mach 2. 2 flow) indicate that over-expanded and under-expanded operation of the nozzle {{has an effect on}} the N-wave boom signature. Analyses demonstrate the feasibility of reducing the magnitude of the sonic boom N-wave by controlling the nozzle plume interaction with the nozzle boat tail shock structure. This work was extended to study the impact of integrating a high aspect ratio exhaust <b>nozzle</b> or long <b>slot</b> <b>nozzle</b> on the trailing edge of a supersonic wing. The nozzle is operated in a highly under-expanded condition, creating a large exhaust plume and a shock at the trailing edge of the wing. This shock interacts with and suppresses the expansion wave caused by the wing, a major contributor to the sonic boom signature. The goal was to reduce the near field pressures caused by the expansion using a <b>slot</b> <b>nozzle</b> located at the wing trailing edge. Results from CFD analysis on a simulated wing cross-section and a <b>slot</b> <b>nozzle</b> indicate potential reductions in sonic boom signature compared to a baseline wing with no propulsion or trailing edge exhaust.
