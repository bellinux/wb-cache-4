5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, he {{released}} another well-received album, Tupelo Honey. This album produced the hit single [...] "Wild Night" [...] {{that was later}} covered by John Mellencamp. The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune, [...] "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen.

500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests you is the concept that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E
500|$|Xbox World Australia {{gave the}} game 90/100, saying [...] "Devil May Cry 4 is {{everything}} a hack-and-slash {{should be and}} then some. Sadly it falters with repeated level design and a moderately troublesome camera; but {{in the grand scheme}} of things, these are only minor flaws." [...] PSM3 gave the game an 80 out of 100. The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game, saying, [...] "Most games these days tend to hold your hand all the way through...Devil May Cry is not like that. It'll throw a million demons at you because it <b>wants</b> <b>to,</b> <b>put</b> in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30-foot stretch of map, force you to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health... and then give you a D at the end of the level because you weren't doing enough combos." ...|$|E
500|$|The vocals on {{the album}} were always live after rehearsing each song five or six times, {{according}} to saxophonist and flautist [...] "Boots" [...] Houston, who further commented that when Morrison and the band went into the studio: [...] "we would then just play a whole set straight through without repeating anything. [...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns." [...] Ted Templeman remarked {{that he had to}} go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison's [...] "ability as a musician, arranger and producer": [...] "When he's got something together, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it down right away with no overdubbing ...

500|$|Dworkin's {{work from}} the early 1980s onward {{contained}} frequent condemnations of incest and pedophilia {{as one of the}} chief forms of violence against women, arguing once that [...] "incest is terrifically important in understanding the condition of women. It is a crime committed against someone, a crime from which many victims never recover". In the early 1980s she had a public row with her former friend Allen Ginsberg over his support for child pornography and pedophilia, in which Ginsberg said, [...] "The right <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> me in jail," [...] and Dworkin responded, [...] "Yes, they're very sentimental; I'd kill you." [...] In 1985, When Hustler published the claim that Dworkin advocated incest, Dworkin sued them for defamatory libel; the court dismissed Dworkin's complaint on the grounds that regardless of whether Hustlers interpretations of her reflections on incest were valid, even a faulty interpretation of a work placed into the [...] "marketplace of ideas" [...] could not amount to defamation in the legal sense.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics.

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Lisa-based shows definitely fall into the hit or miss category, and “Ten” stays within those confines." [...] While he praised some of Homer's scenes, including [...] "his drunken versions of pop songs," [...] he maintained that [...] "not much else connects." [...] He concluded his review by writing [...] "Though we find the occasional laugh, the overall impact remains lackluster." [...] DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B-, and wrote that [...] "Homer's answer to the rhetorical question about gymnastics 'Who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on a leotard and get screamed at?'" [...] was the episode's [...] "highlight".|$|E

500|$|... "Practice Date" [...] {{marked a}} turning point for the {{character}} Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his head down and get his pension, but is asking for it all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E
500|$|After Leslie {{notices the}} name [...] "Liz Waverly" [...] {{in one of}} Kelly's Twilight books, Kelly admits she is his 12-year-old daughter. He is {{divorced}} from her mother, and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Twilight into the time capsule to impress her. Leslie now wants to include it, but Ben (Adam Scott) says if she makes one exception, everyone will want their own item in the capsule. Leslie decides to hold a public meeting so all citizens can make suggestions for capsule items. The meeting descends into chaos when the participants argue over what to include and make absurd suggestions, like human ashes and dead cats. Conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) argues Twilight should not be included because it is too anti-Christian, while a civil liberties organization member says that the book isn't suitable because it is pro-Christian. Leslie tries to compromise by making multiple time capsules, but she ultimately decides to stick to one capsule and include nothing except a video recording of the meeting, which she said represents Pawnee because it shows [...] "a {{lot of people with}} a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in". Ben, a visiting state auditor, says he thinks the residents of Pawnee are strange, but he is impressed by their passion.|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. BET writer Dominique Zonyeé {{spoke on the}} track, calling it a [...] "high energy, boastful song in which Azealia struts her stuff while reminding you that competitors have nothing on her". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound thought that the song had [...] "the potential to a true club banger". Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a dexterous flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she really <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E

500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey". It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} like a white man in a basement in Atlanta".

It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he has made in the past and that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box.

Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, so you just got to appreciate a guy like that being here and doing that kind of work, so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists.
