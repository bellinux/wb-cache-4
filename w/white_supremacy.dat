5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone.

Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, <b>White</b> <b>supremacy,</b> and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

40|$|Lorraine Hansberry’s drama {{addresses}} {{the magnitude of}} two of the most significant systems of violence and displacement in human history that continue to haunt institutional and social relations globally: enslavement and colonisation. The award-winning A Raisin in the Sun (1959) and her unfinished play Les Blancs begun in 1961 (and later completed by her ex-husband and literary executor, Robert Nemiroff from her notes and their conversations), confirm her application of an internationalist vision to a homegrown American context, and her own status as a black middle-class woman writer in a white-male-dominated world of theatre. While the majority of her work recognises and reminds audiences and readers of the tragedy of racism and <b>white</b> <b>supremacy’s</b> toll upon black people’s lives, as this chapter explores, it also brims with the energy of redressing this grim legacy in a broad-reaching call for equality and human rights that is both local and internationally connected...|$|R
5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and <b>white</b> <b>supremacy.</b> It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.|$|E

In the 1950s, about 1.6% {{of the population of}} Minneapolis was nonwhite. Minneapolis contended with <b>white</b> <b>supremacy,</b> participated in desegregation and the civil rights movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans {{have been killed by}} extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain <b>white</b> <b>supremacy.</b> Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
40|$|Ever since jazz {{began to}} make an impact in white {{aesthetic}} culture in the late 1910 s and 1920 s, critics, regardless of whether they celebrated or condemned the music, enmeshed their discourse with images of exoticism, noble savageness, and racial brutishness. As Jazz Studies emerged as an academic discipline, scholars have shown increasing interest in exposing these images in order to illustrate the pervading racist sentiment inscribed within white perception of the jazz idiom and also to establish the connections between jazz and the modernist obsession with primitivism. The aim {{of this paper is to}} contribute further study to the intricacies of primitivism through a close examination of the rhetorical devices enabling the subsistence and efficiency of the <b>white</b> <b>supremacy’s</b> mystification of jazz. In this way, we may better comprehend how the primitivist construct is not a matter of an ideology’s conglomeration of superficial images, nor of mere associations between the music and rituals. These features are certainly operative, but by approaching the metaliguistic techniques implicit in what Roland Barthes calls the bourgeois myth, jazz primitiveness can be conceived as an act of colonization that begins and is self-nurtured by patterns of speech...|$|R
5000|$|Louis Austin worked towards {{achieving}} {{racial equality}} for blacks, {{regardless of their}} socio-economic status, by approaching discriminatory policies with a new, confrontational strategy. Austin shared the political philosophies of Du Bois and Frederick Douglass, both of whom advocated protest as a political tool {{in the struggle for}} equal rights. He realized that confrontation and defiance, not civility and accommodation, were needed to break <b>white</b> <b>supremacy's</b> stronghold in the South. The civil rights movement in Durham during the early 1900s was controlled by wealthy blacks, primarily Spaulding and James Shepherd, president of North Carolina College for Negroes (now known as North Carolina Central University). These black elites were known as the [...] "Big Negroes;" [...] they were intent on maintaining peaceful race relations in Durham {{and did not want to}} promote campaigns that would upset powerful white people in Durham and throughout the country. Confrontational policies would agitate race relations in North Carolina and jeopardize the businesses and enterprises these [...] "Big Negroes" [...] controlled; therefore, they saw no benefit pursuing policies in that interfered with a system in which they were economically and somewhat socially comfortable.|$|R

5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. The Civil Rights Act circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of <b>white</b> <b>supremacy,</b> were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (<b>white</b> <b>supremacy</b> was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by black South Africans as a symbol of <b>white</b> <b>supremacy.</b> The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it was felt it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it was felt appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{eighteen}} months of ethnographic research {{in a high}} school E. L. L. classroom, this study contributes to the fields of new literacies studies and critical pedagogy by showing how transnational Black youth theorize and negotiate intersections of racism, justice, and education. Drawing on a multidimensional approach for understanding how racism is reproduced and resisted across various domains of power (Collins, 2009), I show on how two young men from Haiti theorize the U. N. and INGO occupation of post-earthquake Haiti; a disjuncture between how Africa and Haiti are (mis) known in the U.

Such an approach draws on centering counter-narratives and thinking through the notion of de-colonial love to reframe everyday classroom praxis. Throughout this dissertation I argue that culturally informed, antiracist pedagogies must begin with students 2 ̆ 7 theoretical work and experiential knowledge. Such an approach transforms classrooms into spaces for students to not only interrogate racism but also create (counter) texts that represent their subjectivities as young Black people in the 21 st century. ...|$|R
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of <b>white</b> <b>supremacy</b> and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Our Friends in the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of Our Friends in the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to <b>white</b> <b>supremacy.</b> This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title Our Friends in the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E

40|$|In 1874 and 1875, whites, {{lured by}} the {{discovery}} of gold in the Black Hills, poured into the northern Plains and encountered the indigenous Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne Indians. The Great Sioux War of 1876 - 1877, remembered by most Americans for Custer 2 ̆ 7 s Last Stand in June 1876, sprang from this contact. While Custer and over two hundred of his men lost their lives at the Battle of Little Big Horn, the Cheyenne and Sioux lost far more.

40|$|African American {{literature}} on the Middle Passage has always challenged <b>white</b> <b>supremacy’s</b> language with its power to define and control. This article demonstrates how the border of such a “Universal Language” is challenged and trespassed in Clarence Major’s ekphrastic poem “The Slave Trade: View from the Middle Passage” in order to communicate – through {{the implementation of the}} voice of a disembodied water spirit Mfu – the black perspective on understanding the slave trade and effectively resist the symbolic cannibalism of Western Culture. The trope of antropophagy often appears in Middle Passage poems in the context of (mis) communication (which results in the production of controlling, racist images of blacks) and stands as a sign of Euro-American power to create the historical, hierarchical, racial reality of the Atlantic slave trade in its economic and symbolic dimensions. The strategy implemented by Major in his poetic confrontation with representation of historical slave trade in European and American Fine arts may be classified as “off-modern” (to use Svetlana Boym’s (2001) nomenclature), which immediately places his poem in a “tradition of critical reflection on the modern condition that incorporates nostalgia” as a means of a critical analysis of the heritage and limitations of a given culture. My claim is that the poem’s “off-modern nostalgia” perspective is a version of textualist strategy which Henry Louis Gates (1988) identifies as Signifyin(g). Major/Mfu successfully perforates and destabilizes the assumed objectivity and neutrality of the images of blacks and blackness created and circulated within the realm of the visual arts of the dominant Western Culture. In “The Slave Trade: View from the Middle Passage” Signifyin(g) takes the form of what could be called an ekphrastic (re) interpretation of actual works of art and joins in the critique of essentialist views often associated with understanding of meaning...|$|R
50|$|For their part, {{former slaves}} in the Reconstruction-era South made efforts of their own to {{counteract}} white supremacist violence and injustice. In March 1866, Abraham Winfield and ten other black men petitioned {{the head of the}} Georgia Freedmen's Bureau for relief from the oppression of the Bureau's Court in Savannah—especially for Civil War veterans. In rural areas like Greene County, Georgia, blacks met vigilante violence from whites with violence of their own. But with the withdrawal of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1868 and continuing political violence from whites, blacks ultimately lost this struggle, according to historian Edward L. Ayers.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to reveal the forms of the Ku Klux Klan’s racist actions towards the Blacks and their defenders and to identify how the racism shown in the southern American society based on Franz Fanon’s postcolonialism theory. 	The research employs qualitative study. The subject of the research is a novel by John Grisham entitled A Time to Kill. The data were sentences related to {{the description of the}} forms of racism. The key of this research is the researcher himself, with the concept of forms of racism drawn from Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, and the Ku Klux Klan’s racist actions, all illustrated in the analytical construct. The researcher collected the data by using systematic and scientific manner in the process of identifying the themes and the meaning of the data. The data analysis was conducted through organizing and preparing the data, reading through all the data, coding the data, giving a description, interrelating description and interpreting the meaning of description. 	The findings of this research show that there are three points to reveal the form of the Ku Klux Klan’s racist actions towards the Blacks and their defenders: first is by their violence to show their <b>White</b> <b>Supremacy’s</b> ideology, the second is intimidation to create fear in the society, and the third is provocation to stimulate fights. Meanwhile, to identify how racism shown in the southern American society can be proved by the use of language and the discrimination towards Blacks. First, the Whites use language as weapons to show their superiority by using derogatory terms and to shape the negative images of the Blacks through deployment of images. Second, the Whites’ discrimination towards the Blacks are reflected in the society’s custom related to injustice which is functioned to show that the Blacks have lower qualities and the unfairness in law enforcement to give the Blacks pressure in the society...|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of traditionalistic political culture is often {{thought to have}} arisen principally out of Virginia, {{the first and most}} populous southern colony.
