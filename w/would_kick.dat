5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|The ant {{who lost}} the ritual fight will lower its body, and lean {{sideways}} from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either {{one or both of}} the ants <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E
5|$|General Walker and the Eighth Army began {{preparing}} a counteroffensive, the first {{conducted by the}} UN in the war, for 6 August. It <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> off with an attack by the U.S. reserve units on the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River {{in the middle of}} the month. One of Walker's goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near Taegu by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On 6 August, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by the task force. The plan of attack was to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River, and depended on the arrival of the entire U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks which were en route from the United States.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Walton Walker and the Eighth Army began {{preparing}} a counteroffensive, the first {{conducted by the}} UN in the war, for August. It <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> off with an attack by the US reserve units in the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River {{in the middle of}} the month. One of his goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near the Taegu area by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On August 6, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by Task Force Kean, named for the US 25th Infantry Division commander, Major General William B. Kean. Task Force Kean consisted of the 25th Division, less the 27th Infantry and a field artillery battalion, with the 5th Regimental Combat Team (5th RCT) and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade attached. Together this represented a force of about 20,000 men. The plan of attack required the force to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River. However, the offensive relied on the arrival of the entire 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 season <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> {{off with}} the Supercopa de España, this time against reigning Copa del Rey champions Real Madrid. In Madrid, Barcelona would play to a 2–2 draw, but would seal the Supercup with a 3–2 win at the Camp Nou. The first kick of a ball in La Liga for Barça {{would be at the}} Camp Nou against Villarreal, with the Catalans easily winning 5–0. In the first Liga Clásico of the season, Barcelona would win 1–3 in Madrid to level on points with Madrid heading into the Christmas break. Nevertheless, Barcelona would drop two points away to Espanyol, which ended 1–1, to go two points behind their archrivals Madrid. In the Copa del Rey semi-finals, in the first leg against Real Madrid, the Blaugrana would win 1–2 in Madrid, later sealing their place in the semi-finals after a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou. In the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, the then-defending champions would defeat Bayer Leverkusen 1–3 in Germany and rout them 7–1 at the Camp Nou. The quarter-finals against Milan would begin slowly for the Catalan club, playing to a 0–0 draw in Milan, only to sweep the Italian club aside 3–1 at the Camp Nou with two strikes from Lionel Messi. In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Barcelona would be {{defeated}} 1–0 in London after a Didier Drogba strike in the 45th minute. The second leg, meanwhile, at the Nou Camp finished 2–2, thus eliminating Barcelona from European contention. In the penultimate game of the season at home to Real Madrid, perhaps the most important game of the Catalan club's season, Barça would collapse 1–2 to Real Madrid with a strike each from Sami Khedira and Cristiano Ronaldo, winning Los Blancos the match. On 27 April, coach Pep Guardiola announced in a tearful press conference in Barcelona that he would be stepping down as coach of the Catalan club {{at the end of the}} season, citing that he needed a break from football; he was to be replaced by Tito Vilanova. In Barcelona's final game of the season, the Copa del Rey finals against Athletic Bilbao, Barça would win 3–0 with a brace from Pedro and a strike from Messi, winning the club the trophy. That season, Barça would also win the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, 2–0 against Porto and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, 4–0 against Santos.|$|E

25|$|After {{spending}} the 2012 {{season in the}} Gold Coast NEAFL reserves team, much hyped teenager Jaeger O'Meara was named to make his senior debut in Round 1 against St Kilda. He revealed that not being eligible to play in 2012 had built up a year-long wait of excitement for his first game. O'Meara and the Suns would not disappoint and claimed victory over the Saints with a 13-point win in Round 1. An away trip to visit the Sydney Swans the following week {{would result in a}} loss but was highlighted by a 25 disposal outing for O'Meara. Back to back losses to Brisbane and Port Adelaide followed before a 44-point win against GWS in Canberra. Charlie Dixon <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> six goals in the match and broke the record for most goals kicked in a game by a Gold Coast player.|$|E
25|$|One major storyline {{during this}} period was the {{discovery}} of Batch SW6, a group of clones of the early Legion (from their Adventure Comics days), created by the Dominators. Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed {{to be the real}} Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims’ names being picked at random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the Omega Men in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.|$|E

25|$|After being {{discharged}} from army {{service at the}} end of World War II at the age of 33 he joined Port Adelaide and played 17 games during the 1945 SANFL season. Bunton would form a formidable duo with Bob Quinn helping Port Adelaide attract record crowds for the season. At the end of the minor round Port Adelaide had lost only two games finishing up with a percentage of 133. Bunton would play in the first final of his career with Port Adelaide in their second semi final win against Norwood in front of 36,383 spectators at Adelaide Oval. Bunton <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> 2 goals during the match. The win against Norwood in the second semi final qualified Port Adelaide for the 1945 SANFL Grand Final against West Torrens. During {{the first quarter of the}} 1945 SANFL Grand Final, Port Adelaide kicked a record quarter time score for a SANFL Grand Final of 8.1 (51). However this was not enough for Bunton to win his first premiership as a player with Port Adelaide falling short by 13 points to West Torrens. The 1945 SANFL Grand Final would be Haydn Bunton Sr's last match in senior football.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart <b>would</b> <b>kick</b> out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E
