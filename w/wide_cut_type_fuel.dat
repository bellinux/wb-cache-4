40|$|The {{research}} is {{conducted on the}} modification of neutron kinetic code for the plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> nuclear reactor. REMARK is a neutron kinetic code that works only for the cylindrical <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> nuclear reactor. In this research, our main {{emphasis is on the}} modification of this code in order to be applicable for the plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> nuclear reactor. For this purpose, detailed mathematical studies have been performed and are subjected to write the program in Fortran language. Since REMARK code is written in Fortran language, so we have developed the program in Fortran and then inserted it into the source library of the code. The main emphasis is on the modification of subroutine in the source library of the code for hexagonal fuel assemblies with plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> elements in it. The number of steps involved in the modification of the code has been included in the paper. The verification studies were performed by considering the small modular reactor with hexagonal assemblies and plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> in it to find out the power distribution of the reactor core.

In dispersion <b>type</b> <b>fuels,</b> {{most of the}} atomised U- 10 wt%Zr alloy powders have a smooth surface and frequently near-perfect spherical shape with few attached satellites. All phases of U- 10 wt%Zr powder are found to be-U phases and-UZr 2 with fine and homogeneous structure, and as powder size decreases, these phases are much finer owing to the high cooling rate. During the extrusion, U- 10 wt%Zr particles of dispersion <b>type</b> <b>fuels</b> are dispersed in a Zr matrix by mechanical work, and they are broken and torn into harder a Zr matrix. Meanwhile, in alloy <b>type</b> <b>fuels,</b> the uranium powder and the zirconium powder were mixed, cold pressed, sintered, and then finally extruded. Alloy <b>type</b> U-Zr <b>fuels</b> consist of a-UZr 2 matrix and an-Zr phase, and there are few pores in extrudates owing to elimination during extrusion. 51...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} and quantitative {{evaluation of the}} effects of fire on eco-system nitrogen (N) is urgently needed for directing future fire research and management. This study used a meta-analysis method to synthesize up to 185 data sets from 87 studies published from 1955 to 1999. Six N response variables related to fire were examined: fuel N amount (FNA) and concentration (FNC), soil N amount (SNA) and concentration (SNC), and soil ammonium (NH 41) and nitrate (NO 32) pools. When all comparisons (fire treatment vs. control) were considered together, fire significantly reduced FNA (58 %), increased soil NH 41 (94 %) and NO 32 (152 %), and had no significant influences on FNC, SNA, and SNC. The responses of N to fire varied with different independent variables, which were vegetation <b>type,</b> fire <b>type,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>type,</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption amount, fuel consumption percentage, time after fire, and soil sampling depth. The response of FNA to fire was significantly influenced by vegetation <b>type,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>type,</b> and <b>fuel</b> consumption amount and percentage. The reduction in FNA was linearly correlated with fuel consumption percentage (r 2 5 0. 978). The response of FNC to fire was only affected by <b>fuel</b> <b>type.</b> None of the seven independent variables had any effect on SNA. The responses of SNC, NH 41, and NO 32 depend on soil samplin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} work described {{the effect of}} flow control valve type {{on the performance of}} wobble plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> pump for the stable DME fuel supply. In order to study this, different four types of flow control valves (ITV, SCV, IMV and MPROP) were installed on the wobble plate fuel pump, and fuel flow rate, torque, and temperature variation of pump were investigated under various operating conditions by using pump performance test system. It was revealed that wobble plate <b>type</b> <b>fuel</b> pump worked well with ITV and SCV control valve, and the flow rate and torque of fuel pump was in proportion to the value of valve open duty. The maximum flow rate and torque of fuel pump were achieved around the 50 % duty of control valve. Temperature variation at all pump measuring points were under 60 ℃ which is acceptable.
