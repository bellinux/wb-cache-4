40|$|An {{urgent need}} has arisen to develop starter culture strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{possessing}} {{a wide range}} of specialised properties {{in order to meet the}} new and challenging demands of the various wine producers and consumers.

25|$|Yeast assimilable {{nitrogen}} or YAN is {{the combination}} of Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the fermentable sugars glucose and fructose, nitrogen {{is the most important}} nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults. To this extent winemakers will often supplement the available YAN resources with nitrogen additives such as diammonium phosphate (DAP).|$|E

40|$|Aims: To study genomic and {{phenotypic}} {{changes in}} <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> produced in short time periods analysing yeast strains possibly derived from commercial strains recently dispersed. Methods and Results: We conducted a genomic and phenotypic {{comparison between the}} commercial yeast strain EC 1118 and two novel strains (LV CB and L- 957) isolated from different wine areas industrially intervened < 20 years ago. Molecular analysis by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and RAPD-PCR {{was not able to}} distinguish between these strains. However, comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed discrete DNA gains and losses that allowed unequivocal identification of the strains. Furthermore, analysis of aCGH data supports the hypothesis that strains LV CB and L- 957 are derivatives from strain EC 1118. Finally, scarce phenotypic differences in physiological and metabolic parameters were found among the strains. Conclusion: The <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> have a very dynamic genome that accumulates changes in short time periods. These changes permit the unique genomic identification of the strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study permits the evaluation of microevolutive events in <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> and its relationship with the phenotype in this species.

25|$|In {{red wine}} {{production}} {{the timing of}} when to press {{is one of the}} most important decisions in the wine making process since that will be the moment that maceration and phenolic extraction ceases. Some winemakers use the decreasing sugar level (such as brix measurement) scale and press once the wine has reached complete dryness. Often winemakers will use taste to determine if the wine has extracted enough tannins to produce a balanced wine and may press before complete dryness (such as at 3-8 brix). Though removing the skins by pressing often removes some solids that the <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> need to complete fermentation and the benefits of pressing early is often balanced by the risk of potential stuck fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers tend {{to prefer}} O. oeni for several reasons. First, {{the species is}} {{compatible}} with the main <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though in cases where both MLF and alcoholic fermentation are started together, the yeast most often outcompetes the bacterium for nutritional resources which may cause a delay in the onset of malolactic fermentation. Second, most strains of O. oeni are tolerant to the low pH levels of wine and can usually deal with the standard alcohol levels that most wines reach by the end of fermentation. Additionally, while sulfur dioxide levels above 0.8 molecular SO2 (pH dependent but roughly 35-50 ppm) will inhibit the bacteria, O. oeni is relatively resistant compared to other LAB. Finally, O. oeni tends to produce the least amount of biogenic amines (and most lactic acid) among the lactic acid bacteria encountered in winemaking.|$|E
25|$|The wine is {{fermented}} once on {{the barrel}} and then undergoes a second fermentation in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as tirage). The second fermentation results in a natural sparkling <b>wine.</b> <b>Yeast</b> precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with riddling (remuage in French) {{which means that the}} bottles are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to the neck of the bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks are cooled so that the precipitation freezes to a small block of ice, the bottles are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a crown cap) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called disgorging.|$|E

2500|$|Either {{directly}} or indirectly, <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> {{can be a}} culprit behind {{a wide variety of}} wine faults.

Even the common <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be behind some wine faults with some strains of the yeast known to produce higher than ideal levels of acetic acid, acetaldehyde and volatile sulfur compounds such as thiols. Also any yeast can have a low tolerance to nutritional deficiencies, temperature fluctuation or extremes and excessive or low sugar levels that may lead to a stuck fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{source for}} these {{nutrients}} is {{often found in}} the grape must itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients.

40|$|A rapid {{screening}} method {{for the evaluation}} of the major fermentation products of Saccharomyces <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> was developed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and principal component factor analysis. Calibration equations for the quantification of volatile acidity, glycerol, ethanol, reducing sugar and glucose concentrations in fermented Chenin blanc and synthetic musts were derived from the Fourier transform infrared spectra of small-scale fermentations. The accuracy of quantification of volatile acidity in both Chenin blanc and synthetic must was excellent, and the standard error of prediction was 0. 07 g l⁻¹ and 0. 08 g l⁻¹, respectively. The respective standard error of prediction in Chenin blanc and synthetic musts for ethanol was 0. 32 % v/v and 0. 31 % v/v, for glycerol was 0. 38 g l⁻¹ and 0. 32 g l⁻¹, for reducing sugar in Chenin blanc must was 0. 56 g l⁻¹ and for glucose in synthetic must was 0. 39 g l⁻¹.

40|$|Genetic {{instability}} and genome renewal may cause loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in homothallic <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), {{leading to the}} elimination of the recessive lethal or deleterious alleles that decrease yeast fitness. LOH was not detected in genetically stable <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> during must fermentation. However, after sporula-tion, the heterozygosity of the new yeast population decreased during must fermentation. The frequency of mating between just-germinated haploid cells from different tetrads was very low, and the mating of haploid cells from the same ascus was favored because of the physical proximity. Also, mating restriction between haploid cells from the same ascus was found, leading to a very low frequency of self spore clone mating. This mating restriction slowed down the LOH process of the yeast population, maintaining the heterozygote frequency higher than would be expected assuming a fully random mating of the haploid yeasts or according to the Mortimer genome renewal proposal. The observed LOH occurs because of the linkage of the locus MAT to the chromosome III centromere, without the necessity for self spore clone mating or the high frequency of gene conversion and rapid asymmetric LOH observed in genetically unstable yeasts. This phenomenon is enough in itself to explain the high level of homozygosis found in natural populations of <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The LOH process for centromere-linked markers would be slower than that for the nonlinked markers, because the linkage decreases the frequency of newly originated heterozygous yeasts after each round of sporulation and mating.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the technological usefulness of selected industrial <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus and their intra- and interspecific hybrids responsible for excessively acidic musts. The stability of yeast fermentation profiles in apple musts was assessed after 90 – 170 generations, following previous subculturing under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in media with or without L-malic acid. During this study, 35 apple wines produced by wild strains and their segregates were statistically evaluated according to 12 chemical parameters. Although the wines met the official standards for basic chemical parameters, their total acidity was too low. Both the yeasts and their segregates metabolized from 66. 3 to 77. 0 % of malic acid present in the must. The industrial <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> and their hybrids exhibited marked polymorphism of fermentation profiles in apple must with elevated L-malic acid content. At the same time, the level of demalication activity made it possible to clearly differentiate segregates from the wild strains, which may suggest that malic acid is probably one of the principal factors in the adaptive evolution of yeasts. Our study proves that among industrial <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts,</b> there are both, strains expressing very high stability (Saccharomyces cerevisiae W- 13) and labile ones (S. cerevisiae Syrena). The interspecific hybrids S. cerevisiae × S. bayanus showed low stability of technological features, while the intraspecific hybrid of S. cerevisiae preserved its fermentative capacity.
