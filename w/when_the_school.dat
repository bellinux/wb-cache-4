5|$|The Chana Pine Rock School {{was founded}} in 1883. It {{operated}} until 1953, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> was retired. It was the only wooden, two-room schoolhouse built in the area.

Burnside Place {{remained}} the sole educational facility until the 1840s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> began construction on its first buildings: the central and east wings of the Arts Building. The rest of the campus was essentially a cow pasture, a situation similar to the few other Canadian universities and early American colleges of the age.|$|E

5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for {{vandalism}} by Principal Skinner, who {{has been}} informed by class genius Martin Prince.

However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|Birks' grave {{is in the}} Perth (China Wall) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery near Ypres. A {{memorial}} {{was constructed}} at his old school in Wales in 1921,funded largely by contributions from local people. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> was demolished the Memorial was moved to outside St. Matthews Church where it stands now. On Remembrance Sunday the local branch of the British Legion continues to place a wreath of poppies on the Memorial. A portrait of Fred is {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra, alongside his Victoria Cross. He is also remembered in the Museum in Ypres, Belgium (Cloth Hall).

5|$|Dartmouth College fielded {{its first}} {{football}} team in 1881, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They {{won the first}} contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was blown out 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team developed through the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led the school to a 9–7 record.|$|E
5|$|HMS Defence was {{assigned}} to the Channel Squadron upon completion in 1862. The ship was paid off in 1866 to refit and be re-armed and was briefly reassigned to the Channel Squadron again when she recommissioned in 1868. Defence had brief tours on the North American and Mediterranean Stations, from 1869 to 1872 before she was refitted again from 1872 to 1874. She became guard ship on the Shannon when she recommissioned. The ship was transferred to the Channel Squadron again in 1876 and then became guard ship in 1879 on the Mersey until 1885. Defence was placed in reserve until 1890 when she {{was assigned}} to the mechanical training school at Devonport in 1890. She was renamed Indus <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> adopted that name and served there until sold in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.|$|E

5|$|Independent {{secondary}} schools include Kent College, St Edmund's School and, {{what is the}} oldest school in England, the King's School. St. Augustine established a school shortly after his arrival in Canterbury in 597, and it is from this that the King’s School grew. The documented history of the school only began after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> acquired its present name, referring to Henry VIII. The Kings School in Canterbury {{is one of the}} top public schools in the United Kingdom, regularly featuring in the top ten most expensive school fees lists.|$|E
5|$|No.11 Elementary Flying Training School (No.11 EFTS) {{was formed}} at Benalla, Victoria, on 26June 1941, and {{came under the}} control of Southern Area Command. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader I.C.C. Thomson. Before being taken over by the RAAF, Benalla was an emergency runway for civil aircraft on the journey between Sydney and Melbourne. No.11 EFTS's infrastructure, which included medical facilities and two satellite airstrips, had been budgeted at some £85,000, primarily for buildings and engineering works. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> opened, however, only stores depots and living quarters for the 100-odd staff were completed; instructional courses, which commenced on 24July, were initially held in tents near the main airstrip. No hangars were constructed for the deHavilland Tiger Moth training aircraft until {{towards the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Pastoral care is {{provided}} {{through the house}} system. Each pupil is assigned to a house. Each house has its own accommodation {{in the school and}} its own set of tutors to look after members of the house. There are eight vertically integrated houses in total, each with its own colour and heraldic-like shield: The two boys' boarding houses are York (red) and Northumberland (pale blue). The three day boys' houses are Tees (dark green) and Dale (burgundy), both formed by splitting Teesdale House, the first day boys' house, and finally Durham (gold), which was converted from boarding to day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> expanded in the 1990s. The boarding girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls' house, Longfield (dark pink), and the new houses formed for day girls <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> became co-educational are Marwood (purple) and more recently Bowes (pale green). The school considered abolishing its boarding facilities when, like many boarding schools, it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s. However, numbers unexpectedly improved {{around the turn of the}} millennium, and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive image that boarding received from the Harry Potter series. The school is interdenominational, whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values.|$|E
