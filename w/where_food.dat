5|$|Black-shouldered kites usually hunt singly or in pairs, though <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is {{plentiful}} {{they occur}} in small family groups {{and can be}} loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas <b>where</b> <b>food</b> was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas <b>where</b> <b>food</b> was plentiful.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} {{at the base of}} the lophophore. Food passes through the mouth, muscular pharynx ("throat") and {{oesophagus}} ("gullet"), all of which are lined with cilia and cells that secrete mucus and digestive enzymes. The stomach wall has branched ceca ("pouches") <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is digested, mainly within the cells.|$|E

5|$|A 1996, {{researchers}} {{showed that}} the black-throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots. Within these high shrub density habitats, {{not only is there}} a higher density of warblers, but the population age average is also older, being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|This bird always forages in groups, {{which are}} larger in winter than summer, and have {{constant}} composition in each season. <b>Where</b> <b>food</b> resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females. Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above the tree line, {{although they may}} use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.|$|E

5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, <b>where</b> <b>food</b> becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the battle}} was a British victory, there was {{criticism}} of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that {{a unique opportunity to}} destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient <b>where</b> <b>food</b> supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline {{for the remainder of the}} year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders {{and consume}} {{a range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} {{participated in}} the underground railroad. Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana. Tell City, Evansville, and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad. An important stopover was Westfield, <b>where</b> <b>food</b> and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured). Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward, usually into Michigan, where they could cross safely to Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.|$|E

5|$|The Australian pelican has two {{reproductive}} strategies {{depending on}} the local degree of environmental predictability. Colonies of tens or hundreds, rarely thousands, of birds breed regularly on small coastal and subcoastal islands <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is seasonally or permanently available. In arid inland Australia, especially in the endorheic Lake Eyre basin, pelicans will breed opportunistically in very large numbers of up to 50,000 pairs, when irregular major floods, which may be many years apart, fill ephemeral salt lakes and provide large amounts of food for several months before drying out again.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E

5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores <b>where</b> <b>food</b> and water were plentiful. Flightless birds that had {{previously}} known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had {{a major impact on}} the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans).|$|E
5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores, <b>where</b> <b>food</b> and water were plentiful. Settlement {{expanded}} inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea {{region in the}} 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture <b>where</b> <b>food</b> is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E
