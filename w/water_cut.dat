25|$|Before {{the last}} Ice Age {{the waters of}} the upper Derwent flowed east and {{discharged}} into the sea at Scalby, near Scarborough. The River Hertford, the present middle Derwent and the River Rye flowed east and discharged into the North Sea near Filey Brigg. During the Ice Age these outlets were blocked by a tongue of ice which extended down the North Sea basin carrying with it large amounts of glacial detritus. As the ice melted the detritus was deposited to form the Wykeham moraine and permanently blocked the eastern exits of the watercourse. Water from the melting ice and the North York Moors formed a lake in the Vale of Pickering which expanded and deepened until eventually the water escaped by overflowing at the lowest point at Kirkham. The <b>water</b> <b>cut</b> a gorge through the Howardian Hills as it drained away southwards, breaching the Escrick moraine just east of Wheldrake, and joining the Humber glacial lake.|$|E

McClernand, moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by <b>water,</b> <b>cut</b> his way into the Confederate camps there, and then had to fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage. [...] This battle, reports Rawlins, [...] "confirmed General Grant in his views" [...] that he should [...] "give battle" [...] whenever [...] "he had what he thought a sufficient number of men." [...] Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, whose command was designated the Department of the Missouri.|$|E

Ukrainian troops also entered the town of Shakhtarsk, fought the insurgents that had been occupying it, and captured it around 14:30. This cut off the supply corridor between the territories held by the DPR and LPR, isolating insurgents in Donetsk city. Skirmishes also broke out in the nearby towns of Snizhne and Torez. The intense combat across Shakhtarsk Raion forced a party of Dutch and Australian policemen to call off an attempt to investigate the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Forty-one Ukrainian soldiers deserted their posts and went to the insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing, where they told insurgents that they refused to fight against their [...] "own people". The insurgents allowed them to flee Ukraine, and cross into Russia. By 28 July, the strategic heights of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along with the town of Debaltseve. Insurgents had previously used Savur-Mohyla to shell Ukrainian troops around the town of Marynivka. By 29 July, a further seventeen civilians had been killed in the fighting, along with an additional forty-three people injured. Shelling continued in the Leninskyi and Kyivskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to the city administration, these districts were heavily damaged.|$|E

40|$|A new {{three-phase}} (oil/water/gas) {{flow metering}} {{system has been}} developed {{for use in the}} oil and gas industries, based on Coriolis mass flow metering. To obtain certification for use in the Russian oil and gas industries, trials have taken place at the UK and Russian national flow laboratories, NEL in Glasgow and VNIIR in Kazan, respectively. The metrology of three-phase flow is complex, and the uncertainty of each measurement varies dynamically with the operating point, as well as the metering technology, and other aspects. To a limited extent this is reflected in the error limits allowed in national standards, which may vary with operating point. For example, the GOST standard allows errors in the oil flow rate of ± 6 % for <b>water</b> <b>cuts</b> of less than 70 %, which is increased to ± 15 % for <b>water</b> <b>cuts</b> between 70 and 95 %. The provision of online uncertainty for each measurement, for example in accordance with the British Standard BS- 7986, would be highly desirable, allowing the user to observe in real time variations in measurement quality.

But when this is not so, and the base is narrowed so that the slope of side shall be nearly equal everywhere, she almost always obtains her varied curvature of the plume in another way, by merely turning the crest a little round as it descends.

60|$|On {{the left}} hand, {{the lower part}} (AA) {{consists}} of regular, alternating strata of brown tuffs and greenish laminated mudstone, gently inclined to the right, and conformably covered by a mass (B left) of a white, tufaceous and brecciolated deposit. On the right hand, the whole cliff (BB right) consists of the same white tufaceous matter, which on this side presents scarcely a trace of stratification, but to the left becomes very gradually and rather indistinctly divided into strata quite conformable with the underlying beds (AA): moreover, {{a few hundred yards}} further to the left, where the surface has been less denuded, the tufaceous strata (B left) are conformably covered by another set of strata, like the underlying ones (AA) of this section. In the middle of the diagram, the beds (AA) are seen to be abruptly cut off, and to abut against the tufaceous non-stratified mass; but the line of junction has been accidentally not represented steep enough, for I particularly noticed that before the beds had been tilted to the right, this line must have been nearly vertical. It appears that a current of <b>water</b> <b>cut</b> for itself a deep and steep submarine channel, {{and at the same time}} or afterwards filled it up with the tufaceous and brecciolated matter, and spread the same over the surrounding submarine beds; the matter becoming stratified in these more distant and less troubled parts, and being moreover subsequently covered up by other strata (like AA) not shown in the diagram. It is singular that three of the beds (of AA) are prolonged in their proper direction, as represented, beyond the line of junction into the white tufaceous matter: the prolonged portions of two of the beds are rounded; in the third, the terminal fragment has been pushed upwards: how these beds could have been left thus prolonged, I will not pretend to explain. In another section on the opposite side of a promontory, there was at the foot of this same line of junction, that is at the bottom of the old submarine channel, a pile of fragments of the strata (AA), with their interstices filled up with white tufaceous matter: this is exactly what might have been anticipated under such circumstances.|$|E
