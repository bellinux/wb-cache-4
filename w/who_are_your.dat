2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>your</b> influences? (2) What time of day do you work, {{and what do you}} write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E
