5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew <b>why,</b> <b>or</b> what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} studies that link FAM83A overexpression to lung, prostate, and bladder cancers. Researchers {{believe that this}} gene might make {{a good candidate for}} early detection of these cancers, especially lung cancer. It is unknown <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how FAM83A is upregulated. Studies have shown that arsenic can acetylate the promoter causing upregulation, suggesting this may be a similar mechanism to how this gene becomes unregulated in cancer.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley draws {{important}} {{distinctions between}} the psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal. He states that the psychopath very seldom takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the general picture of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to them <b>why</b> <b>or</b> what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent {{off the edge of the}} cliff instead. Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E

As far as we know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is hard to see <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E
500|$|During the church's early years, no Protestant {{denomination}} was {{the exclusive}} owner or occupant of Capon Chapel, {{which indicates that}} the church was probably utilized as a [...] "union church" [...] for worship by any Christian denomination. Since no single denomination oversaw the church during this early period, few records of its early activities and construction exist. Later records suggest that Capon Chapel {{was used as a}} place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. While it remains unclear <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how the church became associated with the Baptists, its use by the denomination is possibly associated with the Second Great Awakening, a Protestant revival movement during the early-to-mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout the United States. According to the December 1904 issue of The Baptist Home Mission Monthly, the Baptist Little Cacapon Church contributed one dollar to the general fund of Capon Chapel, demonstrating that the Baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with the church in 1904.|$|E

[...] Eddy apart, Twain felt ambivalent toward the premise of mind-cure, arguing that [...] "the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful..." [...] while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards the validity of mind cure adding, [...] "These things are true, or they are not. If they were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago {{it would be difficult to}} satisfactorily explain <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how or by what argument that power should be nonexistent in Christians now."< His daughter Clara Clemens became a Christian Scientist and wrote a book about it, Awake to a Perfect Day (1956).|$|E

500|$|The story {{takes place}} in a fictional {{universe}} where humans live in harmony with gods, resembling humans with slightly pointed ears, and devils (demons in the English dub of the anime), who have more prominently pointed ears. Despite their respective positive and negative connotations, both races are equally kind and good-natured. Ten years prior to the story, the gateway between the worlds of the gods and devils were opened, and since then, people from all races have been immigrating between the worlds. The characters attend the multi-racial high school, [...] in [...] This is so humans, gods and devils can interact and learn to live together in harmony with mutual understanding rather than hatred, fear and ignorance. Also, due to dimensional tears (unknown <b>why</b> <b>or</b> how they appear) some members of each race had been transported to one of the other worlds where they married and had children. This is how some of the students with mixed lineage are able to be older than the gateway to the human world like Mayumi Thyme, whose human parent had fallen into the world of the Devils through one of those tears years before the gateway to the Human world had been opened, or Asa's mother, Ama Shigure, who somehow was transported from the world of the Devils to the Human world.|$|E
500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No <b>why</b> <b>or</b> wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E

A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief.

Loeb won an uneventful , but only by one-tenth of a second ahead of Sordo, and on [...] Sordo was quicker than Loeb, after Loeb stalled on the start-line and was unable to make up the lost seconds. At the midday break, Loeb was lamenting his lead over Sordo. [...] "Now it's a big battle between the two C4s. The other cars for the moment are behind, so it's good news for the team. It would be easier if Dani were bit further behind but I have to deal wit that," [...] he said. [...] "I'll try to keep position this afternoon, but it's not easy. Dani is really fast.
