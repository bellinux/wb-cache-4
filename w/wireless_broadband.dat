40|$|<b>Wireless</b> and <b>broadband</b> {{services}} are increasingly substitutable for and competitive with wireline {{services in the}} markets for basic local telephone service. State commissions are often charged with monitoring competitive conditions in their states and adapting policy to changing conditions. Failure to consider the competitive effect of <b>wireless</b> and <b>broadband</b> services in local telephone markets will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have more market power than they actually do and lead to more intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Conversely, assuming that the availability of <b>wireless</b> and <b>broadband</b> services automatically makes local telephone markets workably competitive will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have less market power than they actually do and lead to less intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Assessing competitive conditions in a market and determining whether a firm or group of firms has market power requires defining the market in product and geographic terms, determining which producers and consumers {{are part of the}} market, measuring market shares and/or other indicators of the competitiveness of the market, and making a determination as to whether the market is or is not workably competitive.

It was the first mobile operator to offer 3G services (UMTS), launched in March 2003. As of March 2010, 3 Italia had 9 million registered customers. 3 Italy is the largest company in the 3-group measured in number of subscribers. It has a roaming agreement with TIM which allows its customers to get a 2G service when they move out of 3G coverage. This agreement allows 3 to offer coverage to up to 99.8% of the population on 2G service. On 22 February 2006, 3 announced the first launch of HSDPA technology in Italy, with initial coverage of Rome. The HSDPA service, which provides <b>wireless</b> <b>broadband</b> access with speed up to 14.4 Megabit/s, has been initially launched offering connection speeds up to 3.6 Megabit/s. The service has been called ADSM (as a contraction for ADSL Mobile).
