5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very {{controversial}} in the West and was {{singled out for}} criticism by the <b>West</b> <b>Germans.</b> The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were {{set up on the}} western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|The east–west interzonal border became {{steadily}} more tense as {{the relationship}} between the Western Allies and the Soviets deteriorated. From September 1947, an increasingly strict regime was imposed on the eastern Soviet zone boundary. The number of Soviet soldiers on the boundary was increased and supplemented with border guards from the newly established East German Volkspolizei ("People's Police"). Many unofficial crossing points were blocked with ditches and barricades. The <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> also stepped up security with the establishment in 1952 of the Federal Border Protection force of 20,000 men– the Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS; however, Allied troops (the British in the north, the Americans in the south) retained responsibility for the military security of the border.|$|E
40|$|This article {{compares the}} attitudes of east and <b>west</b> <b>German</b> workers to their union and works council. The author's {{research}} in the clothing and textile industry examines to what extent union members in east Germany have individualistic or collectivist attitudes towards the newly established institutions of interest representation and whether these {{differ from those of}} their <b>west</b> <b>German</b> colleagues. The conclusion is that overall the east Germans display collectivist attitudes which do not differ significantly from those in the west...|$|R

5|$|<b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
5|$|A new {{programme}} {{was initiated}} subsequently, called Joint European Transport (JET). This {{was set up}} in June 1977, and was based at the then British Aerospace (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus. This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s. It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up {{to the creation of the}} Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by former leader of JET programme, Derek Brown. The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively. The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the <b>West</b> <b>Germans,</b> particularly Lufthansa. However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
25|$|Under the Brandt Administration, West Germany {{attained}} {{a lower rate}} of inflation than in other industrialised countries at that time, while {{a rise in the}} standard of living took place, helped by the floating and revaluation of the mark. This was characterised by the real incomes of employees increasing more sharply than incomes from entrepreneurial work, with the proportion of employees' incomes in the overall national income rising from 65% to 70% between 1969 and 1973, while the proportion of income from entrepreneurial work and property fell over that same period from just under 35% to 30%. In addition, the percentage of <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> living in poverty (based on various definitions) fell between 1969 and 1973. According to one estimate, the percentage of <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> living in poverty fell from 9.7% to 8.9% between 1969 and 1973, and from 20.2% to 14.0% according to another estimate. According to another estimate, the percentage of <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> living in poverty during this period fell from 2.7% to 1.4%.|$|E

However, the <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> pulled back two goals before half time, with six minutes left the <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> scored the winner.

40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{as a means}} to support economic transformation and the ongoing process of catch-up development caught researchers' attention for a number of Central and East European countries. Little research, however, has been carried out for eastern Germany in this respect, although FDI plays an important role there too. Descriptive analysis via the use of unique survey data shows that foreign and <b>west</b> <b>German</b> affiliates perform much better with respect to technological capability and labor productivity than do east German firms. The results of the regression analysis, however, show {{that it is not the}} status of ownership as such that forms a significant determinant of innovativeness in eastern Germany but, rather, firm characteristics, such as firm size, export intensity, technical state of the equipment, and research and development (R&D) activities. Given that foreign and <b>west</b> <b>German</b> affiliates perform better with respect to all of these characteristics, they can be considered {{as a means to}} support the process of technological renewal and economic development. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper tries an {{evaluation}} of <b>west</b> <b>German</b> wage flexibility and mobility of labour {{in comparison with the}} United States using micro panel data. Wage regressions and a switching regression model show, that mobility and wages in western Germany react to industrial labour market conditions, while there are no reactions along regional dimensions. In contrast there exist higher degrees of mobility in the United States in both regional and industrial labour markets. Also wages in the U. S. respond to shocks to regional and industrial labour demand. As industrial mobility is higher in the United States, industrial wage respond less to shocks than German wages. Except for <b>west</b> <b>German</b> regional labour market performance, these outcomes correspond to what a competitive model of the labour market would predict.

25|$|With the 1969 {{reform in}} place, the {{acceptance}} of homosexual acts or homosexual identities for <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> was far from in place.

25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The <b>West</b> <b>Germans</b> called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, the {{communist}} German Democratic Republic {{was founded in}} the Soviet-occupied {{eastern part of the}} country.
