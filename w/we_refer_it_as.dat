40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the multicast capacity for static ad hoc networks with heterogeneous clusters. We study {{the effect of}} heterogeneous cluster traffic (HCT) on the achievable capacity. HCT means cluster clients {{are more likely to}} appear near the cluster head, instead of being uniformly distributed across the network. Such property is commonly found in real networks. By adopting max-min fairness, the minimum among all individual multicast capacities of clusters can be maximized. Since this minimal individual multicast capacity will not be maximized unlimitedly, our work focuses on deriving the upper bound of the minimum individual multicast capacity (<b>we</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> minimum capacity for simplicity) in HCT, which provides the best performance for the minimum multicast capacity to attain in the whole network. We find that HCT increases minimum capacity for ad hoc networks. Further, the multicast capacity achieving scheme is provided to justify the derived asymptotic upper bound for the minimum capacity.

Recently, for a tensor with nonnegative entries (which <b>we</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a nonnegative tensor), efficient numerical schemes have been proposed to calculate its maximum eigenvalue based on a Perron-Frobenius-type theorem. In this paper, we consider {{a new class of}} tensors called essentially nonnegative tensors, which extends the concept of nonnegative tensors, and examine the maximum eigenvalue of an essentially nonnegative tensor using the polynomial optimization techniques. We first establish that finding the maximum eigenvalue of an essentially nonnegative symmetric tensor is equivalent to solving a sum of squares of polynomials (SOS) optimization problem, which, in its turn, can be equivalently rewritten as a semi-definite programming problem. Then, using this sum of squares programming problem, we also provide upper and lower estimates for the maximum eigenvalue of general symmetric tensors. These upper and lower estimates can be calculated in terms of the entries of the tensor. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the significance of the results.

40|$|A {{detailed}} numerical {{study of}} the real space configuration of vortices in disordered superconductors using 2 D London-Langevin model is presented. The magnetic field B is varied between 0 and B_c 2 for various pinning strengths Δ. For weak pinning, an inhomogeneous disordered vortex matter is observed, in which the topologically ordered vortex lattice survives in large domains. The majority of the dislocations in this state are confined to the grain boundaries/domain walls. Such quasi-ordered configurations are observed in the intermediate fields, and <b>we</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the domain regime (DR). The DR is distinct from the low-field and the high-fields amorphous regimes which are characterized by a homogeneous distribution of defects over the entire system. Analysis of the real space configuration suggests domain wall roughening as a possible mechanism for the crossover from the DR to the high-field amorphous regime. The DR also shows a sharp crossover to the high temperature vortex liquid phase. The domain size distribution and the roughness exponent of the lattice in the DR are also calculated. The results are compared {{with some of the}} recent Bitter decoration experiments. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

We show that the general energy preserving theorem (EPT), which is valid for both linearly independent (orthogonal and nonorthogonal) and linearly dependent set of vectors, proposed by Singh P. et al. is a generalization of the discrete spiral of Theodorus (or square root spiral or Einstein spiral or Pythagorean spiral). From the EPT, we obtain the (2 D) discrete spiral of Theodorus and show that the multidimensional discrete spirals (e. g. a 3 D spiral) can be easily generated using a set of multidimensional energy preserving unit vectors. We also establish that the recently proposed methods (e. g. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transforms (SSWT), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD), Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM), etc.), for nonlinear and nonstationary time series analysis, are nonlinear time-invariant (NTI) system models of filtering.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{collective}} dynamical state, namely the mixed mode oscillation suppression state where {{different set of}} variables {{of a system of}} coupled oscillators show different types of oscillation suppression states. We identify two variants of it: The first one is a mixed mode death (MMD) state where a set of variables of a system of coupled oscillators show an oscillation death (OD) state, while the rest are in an amplitude death (AD) state under the identical parametric condition. In the second mixed death state (<b>we</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the MNAD state) a nontrivial bistable AD and a monostable AD state appear simultaneously to different set of variables of a same system. We find these states in paradigmatic chaotic Lorenz system and Lorenz-like system under generic coupling schemes. We identify that while the reflection symmetry breaking is responsible for the MNAD state, the breaking of both the reflection and translational symmetries result in the MMD state. Using a rigorous bifurcation analysis we establish the occurrence of the MMD and MNAD states, and map their transition routes in parameter space. Moreover, we report the first experimental observation of the MMD and MNAD states that supports our theoretical results. We believe that this study will broaden our understanding of oscillation suppression states, subsequently, it may have applications in many real physical systems, such as laser and geomagnetic systems, whose mathematical models mimic the Lorenz system.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} offers {{different types}} of computational services to end users via computer networks. Nowadays {{it has become a}} trend that individuals and IT enterprises store data remotely to the cloud in a flexible on-demand manner, which has become a popular way of data outsourcing. This has reduced the burden for storage management and maintenances and costs on hardware and software, with great advancement of universal data access and convenience to users. In fact, cloud storage {{has become one of the}} major services in cloud computing where user data are stored and maintained by cloud servers. It allows users to access their data via computer networks at anytime and from anywhere. Despite the great benefits provided by cloud computing, data security is a very important yet challenging problem that must be solved. One of the major concerns of data security is data integrity in a remote storage system. Although storing data in the cloud is attractive, it does not usually offer any guarantee on data integrity and retrievability. Unfortunately, many Remote Integrity Checking (RIC) schemes in the literature are insecure. In this thesis, we will provide a cryptanalysis against a well-known RIC scheme. Our analysis approach can also be applied to other similar RIC schemes. We also provide a solution to the problem. It is also very important that an auditing process should not introduce new vulnerabilities of unauthorized information leakage towards their data security. The previous efforts in RIC accommodate several security features including data integrity and confidentiality, which mainly ensure secure maintenance of data. However, they do not cover the issue of data privacy, which means that the communication flows (RIC proofs) from the cloud server should not reveal any useful information to the adversary. Intuitively, by 2 ̆ 2 privacy 2 ̆ 2, we mean that an adversary should not be able to distinguish which file has been uploaded by the client and maintained by the cloud server. <b>We</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Indistinguishability (or IND, for short).

We demonstrate that a well-known privacy-preserving RIC protocol do not provide IND-Privacy. Actually, we can conclude that all current RIC protocols do not provide IND-privacy. We also show that with a witness distinguishability proof, we are able to achieve IND-Privacy in RIC.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in astrophysics is how angular momentum is transported in protoplanetary disks (PPDs - disks containing gas and dust orbit around newly-forming protostars). Collisional viscosity is believed to be insufficient for angular momentum transport. Therefore, turbulence enhanced transport are proposed. In addition, long-lived coherent vortices are also speculated to exist in PPDs, which could {{play an important role in}} completing star formation and building planets. Without instabilities, turbulence and vortices cannot form. In weak magnetized PPDs, magneto-rotational instability (MRI) operates to generate turbulence. However, regions known as ``dead zone", are cool and unionized to have MRI. This has led to intense theoretical and computational search for pure hydrodynamic instabilities. A new hydrodynamic, finite amplitude instability has been discovered in linearly stable, rotating, stably-stratified, shear flows. The instability starts from a new family of critical layers - baroclinic critical layers. These critical layers, which are linear, neutrally stable eigenmodes in stratified shear flows, have singularity in their vertical velocities. Under the effect of rotation, these critical layers produce vortex layers. Vortex layers intensify by drawing energy from the background shear flows, and subsequently roll up to create new vortices, which in turn excite new critical layers. The whole process self-replicates until the whole domain is filled with large-volume, large amplitude vortices. Because this instability can occur in the dead zones of protoplanetary disks <b>we</b> <b>refer</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> zombie instability and these new class of vortices that self-replicate as zombie vortices. High resolution numerical simulations show this instability can be triggered by a variety of weak perturbations including small volume compact single vortex, a pair of vortices and noise. The threshold of the instability is determined by the Rossby number or vorticity of the initial perturbations. Energy analysis based on the zonal non-zonal decomposition of the energy shows energy that supplies the instability is extracted from the zonal flows. Vortex is responsible for the energy extraction process. Instability saturates when the all the space are taken by zombie vortices. The separation distance between zombie vortices is approximately the distance from critical layers with lowest stream-wise wave number to the perturbations. The flows at late time are determined only by the background parameters not their initial perturbations. Zombie instability is also discussed in a broader picture to show the dead zones of PPDs are not dead. Our numerical simulation suggest although zombie instability is a finite-amplitude instability, due to the large Reynolds number of the disk flows, it is effectively a linear instability. How zombie instability might lead to sufficient angular momentum transport is also discussed. Finally, we speculate there might not be a laminar Keplerian disks at all. The disk flows are essentially turbulence from the collapsing of gas cloud with possibility turbulent flows filled with zombie vortices. A newly developed semi-analytic method for flows with strong background shear is also presented to be an alternative to widely used shearing sheet method in the astrophysical community. The semi-analytic method is used for simulating internal inertial-gravity waves in rotating, stratified flows with and without shear. The method can also be generalized to systems with linear forcing terms...|$|E
