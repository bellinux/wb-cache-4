5|$|Napoleon <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the Allied {{forces would}} attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank.

5|$|Manager, Neil Warnock {{revealed}} on 3 May that he <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> Kisnorbo {{may return}} from injury {{in time for}} the start of the 2012–13 pre-season. With Kisnorbo missing several pre-season games he wasn't allocated a number for the 2012–13 season, losing his number 3 squad number to Adam Drury. Kisnorbo returned to the Leeds squad on 4 August in the pre-season friendly against Preston North End. Kisnorbo was allocated the squad number 6 for the upcoming season and was named on the bench for the first game of the season against Shrewsbury Town on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an {{interest}} in the development of helicopters, taking rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. Bell's company was in a poor financial situation, and he <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the Army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft, and agreed to do so, although for $25,000 each rather than the $35,000 Bell was asking for, and found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux would go on {{to become one of the}} world's most recognizable helicopters.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 2004, {{the airline}} ceased all {{operations}} {{with the remaining}} one hundred employees losing their jobs, and the islands of Tonga being left without domestic air service. The closure was forced as the airline's only airworthy aircraft, the Shorts 360, broke down and the airline had no funds with which to repair it. Airline administration <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the government would bail it out, but this did not eventuate.|$|E

25|$|Gross {{domestic}} product growth of 3.6% in 2000 {{was expected to}} have fallen to around 1.5% in 2001, and only a minor recovery was forecast for 2002. The government <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> tax cuts, subsidies on child-care expenses, and wage increases would boost consumer confidence with real disposable income to increase by 5.4%. Exports were also expected to pick up in 2002, helped by {{the weakness of the}} Swedish krona, which hit record lows against both the dollar and the Euro in 2001.|$|E

It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, and a lot of black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{legislation}} passed the House, and the Coinage Act of 1864 {{was signed by}} President Abraham Lincoln on April22, 1864. [...] The legislation made base metal coins legal tender for the first time: both cents and two-cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten. The government would not, however, redeem them in bulk. The act also outlawed the private one- and two-cent tokens, and later that year Congress abolished all such issues. The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper-nickel cents; it had been drafted by Pollock, who <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the seignorage income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations, {{and he did not}} want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces. Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a three-cent piece in 1865 and a five-cent piece in 1866, both of his proposed alloy, out of which the [...] "nickel", as the latter coin has come to be known, is still struck.|$|E
500|$|Groves {{met with}} the Chief of United States Army Air Forces, General Henry H. Arnold, in March 1944 to discuss the {{delivery}} of the finished bombs to their targets. Groves <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the Boeing B-29 Superfortress {{would be able to}} carry the finished bombs. The 509th Composite Group was duly activated on 17 December 1944 at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, under the command of Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. A joint Manhattan District – USAAF targeting committee was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets; it recommended Kokura, Hiroshima, Niigata and Kyoto. At this point, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto. Groves attempted to get him to change his mind several times and Stimson refused every time. [...] Kyoto had been the capital of Japan for centuries, and was of great cultural and religious significance. [...] In the end, Groves asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well. Nagasaki was substituted for Kyoto as a target.|$|E
500|$|In early March 2003, {{according}} to the official Nintendo website, F-Zero was delayed by two months. Via a live video conference call from Japan on July 7, 2003, co-producers Shigeru Miyamoto and Toshihiro Nagoshi, and supervisor Takaya Imamura answered questions about the two F-Zero games. There, Miyamoto announced the Japanese version of the game was finished and would soon {{be available to the}} public. Nagoshi mentioned that back at E3 2003, he <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> they would have that time to include a local area network (LAN) multiplayer mode, however they chose not to support this mode. The development team focused more on the game's single-player aspects, and a LAN multiplayer mode would distract greatly from it. Imamura commented that even though he worked directly on F-Zero throughout its different incarnations, this time he took a [...] "step back and was involved at kind of a producer level at looking over the game." [...] Imamura added [...] "hav worked on the F-Zero series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past F-Zero GX and AX." ...|$|E

Despite this, Wharton and his nickel interests made repeated attempts to return nickel to the cent, each time failing, both as part of the deliberations over what became the Coinage Act of 1873, and in the early 1880s.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and, in a later press conference, Alonso said that his victory [...] "meant a lot" [...] for him to remain in contention for the Drivers' Championship and thanked his team for their efforts during the weekend.

Vettel said that he <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> Alonso would make a mistake but acknowledged that it was difficult to overtake on the circuit. He also said that attempting to overtake Alonso {{in the final stages of}} the race was [...] "the only chance" [...] that he had of winning the race and hoped that the remaining tracks would suit his Red Bull car. Webber stated that he was [...] "very happy" [...] with his third-place finish and said the entire race weekend was the toughest of the year on him. He also said that he did not feel comfortable throughout the weekend and that he was staying composed through certain sections of the race.|$|E
