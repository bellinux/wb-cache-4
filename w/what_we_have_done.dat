500|$|Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the decision in the Scientology case. Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times, [...] "It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> is we've really tried {{to make sure that we}} have not directed our fire at anyone in particular." [...] He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics, [...] "One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — politics, religion, nationalism. Fringe faiths, fringe nationalities." ...|$|E

500|$|Widmerpool's egotism and will-power enable him, once set, {{to carry}} all before him, {{although}} before his ultimate downfall his powers develop in somewhat sinister directions. [...] In {{a review of}} the early novels in the sequence, Arthur Mizener wrote: [...] "Powell makes his great egoists, for all their absurdity, something not essentially different from all the rest of us; even Widmerpool, the most extravagant of the lot, is not. However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to remind us, not so much, perhaps, of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> as what we have, in our time, known we might do".|$|E
500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no winners and losers. The important thing here is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> is hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E

Flea {{commented on the}} induction by saying, [...] "It's always been {{easy for me to}} pooh-pooh these awards– the [...] Hall of Fame too. But I inducted Metallica a couple of years ago, and it was really a beautiful thing to see as all these people were being inducted. It made me love it. I love halls of fame anyway– the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Baseball Hall of Fame. So I feel grateful for the recognition of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and for the hope and potential of what we'll continue to do." ...|$|E

Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend Ian Holloway also making it in football management. [...] "We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values," [...] I truly believe that it's {{because of the way}} we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the game.

2500|$|Williamson began {{a program}} of cost cutting, {{elimination}} of unprofitable businesses, and financial restructuring. As Williamson later told the New York Times in June 2005, [...] "We had businesses in trading, in marketing, in broadband communications, in Europe, in communications as far as China. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> is very systematically sell those off, shut down offices and concentrate on the two businesses that looked like we had a competitive advantage." [...] Dynegy sold its telecommunications business in Europe in January 2003, restated its income for 2001 and 2002, sold a natural gas terminal in Louisiana, sold its telecommunications business in North America in April 2003, engaged in a US$1.6 billion refinancing and other restructuring of its debt, sold its Illinois Power Company subsidiary to Ameren, and nullified a number of contracts in non-core or money-losing areas. In March 2004, Wiliamson was named chairman of the company, succeeding Dan Dienstbier (who retired).|$|E
2500|$|On 3 June 2009, {{foreign ministers}} {{assembled}} in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, for the OAS's 39th General Assembly, passed {{a vote to}} lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. The United States had been pressuring the OAS for weeks to condition Cuba's readmission to the group on democratic principles and commitment to human rights. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Fander Falconí said {{there will be no}} such conditions. [...] "This is a new proposal, it has no conditions—of any kind," [...] Falconí said. [...] "That suspension was made in the Cold War, {{in the language of the}} Cold War. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> here is fix a historic error." [...] The suspension was lifted at the end of the General Assembly, but, to be readmitted to the Organization, Cuba will need to comply with all the treaties signed by the Member States, including the Inter-American Democratic Charter of 2001. [...] A statement issued by the Cuban government dated 8 June, 2009, stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly's gesture, in light of the Organization's historical record [...] "Cuba will not return to the OAS." ...|$|E
