60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} about, Jeff Durgin?" [...] Cynthia demanded, severely. [...] "What would your mother do? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> this winter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madge sobbed out {{the whole}} story disconsolately. Burton's father would not let him marry {{her because she was}} an Oliver. And, oh, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|She acted of her {{own free}} will. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> and made nobody responsible.|$|R
60|$|As Dorothy {{had no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> {{could make}} no reply to this.|$|R
60|$|Rosa {{appeared}} to consider <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if the awkward supposititious case were hers.|$|R
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Would she cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|E
6000|$|Siegmund {{went back}} to his seat. He was relieved, but he trembled with sickness. We are all glad when intense moments are done with; but why did she fling round in that manner, {{stopping}} the keen note short; <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} that may be, but he hasn't done it yet. Come, father; you don't like the man any more than she does. If {{you get tired of}} him in three days, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> in her whole life?' ...|$|E
60|$|Bob wondered, {{in his own}} mind, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if <b>she</b> {{was making}} bad weather.|$|R
5000|$|Extended {{dialogue}} between Tracy and other library staff where they discuss <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with Tsui Chik if they cohabited.|$|R
60|$|With no {{perceptible}} {{movement that}} I was aware of, Mrs. Jones advertised her certitude {{of knowledge of}} <b>what</b> <b>SHE</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done.</b>|$|R
60|$|Making {{a violent}} effort she sat up. The silence of Ciccio {{in his bed}} was as horrible {{as the rest of}} the night. She had a horror of him also. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> where should she flee? She was lost--lost--lost utterly.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, though, Tommy felt uneasy. It {{was plain}} {{to be seen}} that Bessie had set her heart on that doll. And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when the doll was sold, as would {{probably}} happen soon? Tommy thought Bessie would feel awful sad, {{and he would be}} responsible for it.|$|E
6000|$|Fifteen {{minutes longer}} did Mary Margaret watch restlessly at the window. Then she {{concluded}} {{that something was}} desperately wrong somewhere. It was half an hour after sunset and the Big Dipper light, {{the most important one}} along the whole coast, was not lighted. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What could she do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And fancy, Lady Margaret,--Lady Bracy {{absolutely}} {{asked her}} to go to Carstairs! That woman was always infatuated about Dr. Wortle. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have <b>done</b> if they had gone, and this other man had followed his sister-in-law there. But Lord and Lady Bracy would ask any one to Carstairs,--just any one that they could get hold of!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> {{with the}} {{instruction}} {{if she had}} got it," [...] said the judge, dryly, {{and the young man}} ventured in her behalf: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{she should}} {{make her way}} to London, which is likely--for where could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city; and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> wish to <b>do,</b> but lose and hide herself, if <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not go home?--' ...|$|R
6000|$|Anne felt a queer little {{sensation}} of dismayed surprise. She {{had not known}} this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> without their inspiring rivalry? Would not work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat without her friend the enemy? ...|$|E
6000|$|Goody Grace, who {{was looking}} after the {{children}} till the stepmother could be found, came and expostulated with Patience, telling her she was foolish to miss such a chance, {{and that she would}} find out her mistake when Stead married and that little flighty, light-headed wench made the place too hot to hold her. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> then? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{how would}} Beatrice fare? Would she come to herself safely? He thought so, {{it was only}} a fainting fit. But when she did recover, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Nothing rash, he prayed. And what could {{be the end of it}} all? Who might say? How {{fortunate}} that the sister had been so sound asleep. Somehow he did not trust Elizabeth--he feared her.|$|E
5000|$|Junie B's Essential Survival Guide To School (#30) (2010) In this Junie B. book, Junie B. {{teaches you}} how to survive school and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if <b>she</b> is a teacher.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was moved}} to ask her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> about Africa. [...] "Leave it to Lord Robert!" [...] she said, leaning forward impressively. [...] "Leave {{it to the people}} who know." ...|$|R
6000|$|FANNY [leaning over a chair, she {{is staring}} {{into the eyes of}} the first Lady Bantock]. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> if <b>she</b> had ever got herself into a really {{first-class}} muddle? ...|$|R
60|$|Siegmund {{could find}} no answer. He tried to imagine her life. It would go on, after his death, just in the same way, for a while, and then? He had not the faintest {{knowledge}} of how she would develop. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she was thirty-eight, and as old as himself? He could not conceive. Yet she would not die, of that he was certain.|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll {{be before}} I want to," [...] she replied; {{and at that}} he marched {{out of the house}} with his bundle. She sat {{trembling}} slightly, but her heart brimming with contempt. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> if he went to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman? But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him. Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun {{watched him}} {{still for a}} few seconds. Then she turned away. It was finished, her spell of divination in him. She felt already purely cynical. She looked at Gerald. He was {{wonderful}} {{like a piece of}} radium to her. She felt she could consume herself and know ALL, by means of this fatal, living metal. She smiled to herself at her fancy. And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with herself, when she had destroyed herself? For if spirit, if integral being is destructible, Matter is indestructible.|$|E
5000|$|Las Vegas Callbacks (Part 1): Made {{jokes about}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with the million dollars if she won. The jokes fell flat with the judges, who commented {{about it being}} the [...] "same shtick".|$|R
6000|$|Evidently {{anxious to}} know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in {{aforesaid}} case, Mr. Fletcher {{decided to put}} one before her as speedily as possible, so he said, in a pensive tone, and with a wistful glance: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Quince {{subsided}} into vague mutterings as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if <b>she</b> were a man, {{coupled with}} sundry aspersions upon the character, looks, and family connections of Farmer Rose, which somewhat consoled her for being what she was.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is hard to}} {{separate}} from one who craves for you as she craves her drugs--yes, she takes drugs now, mademoiselle. It is impossible for one who has any compassion in his soul. Besides, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> We live from hand to mouth, in a strange land. She has no friends here, not one. How could I leave her while this war lasts? As well could two persons on a desert island separate. She is killing herself, too, with these drugs, and I cannot stop her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{even if the}} rumours be untrue I {{will not}} marry her,' said Paul. Roger shrugged his shoulders. He was doubtless {{thinking}} of Hetta Carbury, but he said nothing. 'And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> remaining here?' continued Paul. Roger admitted {{that it would be}} awkward. 'I am determined that under no circumstances will I marry her. I know I have been a fool. I know I have been wrong. But of course, if there be a fair cause for my broken word, I will use it if I can.' ...|$|E
60|$|Clara, {{when she}} had read the letter, sat down and cried, holding the bundle of notes in her hand. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with them? Should she send them back? Oh no;--she would do nothing to displease him, or to make him {{think that she was}} angry with him. Besides, she had none of that dislike to taking his money which she had felt as to {{receiving}} money from Captain Aylmer. He had said that she would be his sister, and she would take from him any assistance that a sister might properly take from a brother.|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Elliott {{were living}} comfortably and harmoniously {{in the green}} house. Leslie was busy with sewing, for she and Owen were to be married at Christmas. Anne {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> when Leslie was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It troubled me more, Frank, {{than even}} my own affairs. As soon as I {{had time to}} think at all, I could not imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and the only comfort was that she had you to look after her." ...|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum, who, by {{slipping}} {{up behind}} her and biting one of her heels, had made her let go of Peter, grinned down at her from a safe place in a tree. Jimmy Skunk stood grinning {{at her in the}} most provoking manner, and <b>she</b> couldn't <b>do</b> a thing about it, because she had no desire to have Jimmy use his little bag of perfume. So she talked herself out and then with many parting threats of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> started for home. Unc' Billy noticed that she limped a little with the foot he had nipped so hard, and he couldn't help feeling just a little bit sorry for her.|$|R
