5|$|Among {{the star}} guest singers during the Davis years were the sopranos Montserrat Caballé and Leontyne Price, the tenors Carlo Bergonzi, Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti and the bass Gottlob Frick. British singers {{appearing}} {{with the company}} included Janet Baker, Heather Harper, John Tomlinson and Richard Van Allan. Davis's tenure, {{at that time the}} longest in The Royal Opera's history, closed in July 1986 not with a gala, but, at his insistence, with a promenade performance of Fidelio <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> admission prices.|$|E
5|$|As a result, in {{an attempt}} to avoid a naval {{conflict}} with the superior British Royal Navy, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> labour by the British Empire to work mines and construct railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the salt}} {{extraction}} activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> salt {{produced in the}} Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. However, commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Wilders {{was elected}} for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the {{municipal}} council of Utrecht, {{the fourth largest}} city of the Netherlands. He lived in Kanaleneiland, a suburb <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> social housing and high apartment blocks, which has a relatively high number of immigrants. While a city councilor, Wilders was mugged in his own neighbourhood; some have speculated that this may have catalysed his political transformation. He was not rewarded for his time on the municipal council of Utrecht, for in the following elections he would score well {{below the national average}} in the University city.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he has other motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of his hand, and establishes Gorner's complicity in a scheme to not only flood Europe <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The attack is to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Florida was {{transferred}} back to Spain which lured Americans <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley {{seized the opportunity}} and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close {{to the west bank}} of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old Wolof girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
25|$|In 1886 the Northern Pacific also opened {{colonization}} {{offices in}} Germany and Scandinavia, attracting farmers <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> package transportation and purchase deals. The {{success of the}} NP {{was based on the}} abundant crops of wheat and other grains and the attraction to settlers of the Red River Valley along the Minnesota-North Dakota border between 1881 and 1890.|$|E
25|$|Parts of the EU {{stocks are}} {{exported}} {{with the use}} of export subsidies. It is argued that many African and Asian dairy, tomato and poultry farmers cannot keep up <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> competition from Europe, thus their incomes can no longer provide for their families. At the same time, many urbanised families in the developing world benefit from the relatively cheaper products stemming from Europe.|$|E

In Excursions, Adventures, and Field-sports in Ceylon (Preface and Appendix O of Volume 1 and chapter 13 of Volume 2 - see Bibliography below) he set out his views on colonization, including the merits of providing colonists <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> passage, land and labour (including convict labour).|$|E
25|$|The Bethlehem Steel Corporation (using the Bethlehem Steel Company) and the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, {{which was}} also a Bethlehem Steel Corporation subsidiary, {{were two of the}} most {{powerful}} symbols of American industrial manufacturing leadership. Their demise is often cited {{as one of the most}} prominent examples of the U.S. economy's shift away from industrial manufacturing, its failure to compete <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> foreign labor, and management's penchant for short-term profits.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Ryan {{was elected}} International {{president}} in 1927.

25|$|Four years later, {{when the}} Giants moved to San Francisco {{and left the}} Polo Grounds vacant, J. G.

He came to the same conclusion as Sheehan, that it had originated with Dorgan and the association of the Chinese immigrants <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> labor. However, his article was reprinted in the Los Angeles Times, and readers there wrote in with alternative suggestions afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Some European {{countries}} {{produce a}} significant fraction of their electricity needs from wood or wood wastes. In Scandinavian countries {{the costs of}} manual labor to process firewood is very high. Therefore, {{it is common to}} import firewood from countries <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> labor and natural resources. The main exporters to Scandinavia are the Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). In Finland, there is a growing interest in using wood waste as fuel for home and industrial heating, in the form of compacted pellets.|$|E

25|$|Billingsgate Market {{had already}} {{relocated}} from the City to Docklands, {{and this was}} thought to be typical of the type of industry which might be accommodated. There was some success, however it became apparent that the market for large industrial sites in central London no longer existed. The LDDC was competing with similar organisations based in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Tyneside, Glasgow and other British cities affected by industrial decline. Lower labour costs and land costs coupled <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> availability of transport made these cities - and those abroad - more viable as industrial locations.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the life preserver manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E
25|$|FLOC {{continued}} {{to address issues}} related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased {{only a portion of}} their product, but the higher costs of wages and benefits affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete <b>with</b> <b>cheap</b> Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.|$|E
