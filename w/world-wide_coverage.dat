The men thought they were being "treated," not studied, for what they thought of as "bad blood. " The study has become a central metaphor for distrust of the health care system and as the key example of unethical research. She was a member of the Legacy Committee on the Study that successfully lobbied President Bill Clinton to offer a public apology to the surviving men and their heirs in 1997.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper {{outlines}} {{the ways in}} which a little-used archive of early public health records may throw light on longer-term trends in international epidemic behaviour and serve as a major source of epidemiological information for historians of urbanization and public health. The Weekly Abstract of Sanitary Reports was the official disease surveillance report of the US Public Health Service and its predecessors, and began to publish urban mortality statistics on a regular basis in 1888. Here, the authors describe the first 25 years of continuous reporting (1888 - 1912), when the Reports contained not only disease data for US cities, but also records sent back by US consuls based in some 250 cities {{in many parts of the}} world. METHODS: The content of the weekly editions of the Reports was systematically sampled and analysed using graphical techniques and the simple statistical method of running means. RESULTS: Relatively complete weekly series of mortality from all causes, and six infectious diseases (diphtheria, enteric or typhoid fever, measles, scarlet fever, tuberculosis and whooping cough) were identified for a total of 100 cities <b>world-wide.</b> CONCLUSION: Reporting <b>coverage</b> for these cities is sufficiently complete that multivariate analysis should be possible to obtain a comparative picture of mortality for many parts of the world.

40|$|The {{plight of}} the Rohingyas has become better known {{since the start of}} 2009, in {{particular}} because of <b>world-wide</b> media <b>coverage</b> of the case of the so-called “boat people”, consisting of hundreds of Rohingyas who attempted to reach Thailand by boat and were subsequently mistreated there. Despite this new interest in the Rohingya community, very little work has been done to examine the root causes behind their continuous suffering. The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority group residing in North Arakan State in Western Burma. It is estimated that there are approximately 800, 000 Rohingyas in Arakan State, and many hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees in other countries. There are disputes over the historical records, and whether the Rohingyas are an indigenous group or whether in fact they began entering Burma in the late 19 th century. Even the very name ‘Rohingya’ has been disputed. Whatever position is taken on these questions, it is undeniable that the Rohingyas exist, and have done so for decades, as a significant minority group in North Arakan State. For many years, the Rohingyas have been enduring human rights abuses. These violations are on-going and in urgent need of attention and redress. Irish Aid provided funding for independent research to be conducted by the Irish Centre for Human Rights on the situation of the Rohingyas. The content and views expressed in the resulting Report by the Irish Centre for Human Rights are entirely those of the authors. This Report is based on a fact-finding mission to the region, including Burma, as well as on extensive open-source research, and confidential meetings with organisations working in the region. Much of the most important information came from the many interviews conducted with Rohingya individuals in and around refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they were able to speak more freely than they can in Burma itself about the violations they had endured and which had caused them to flee their homes. The Report examines the situation of the Rohingyas through the lens of crimes against humanity. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and international criminal law jurisprudence, especially that of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, are used to provide detailed and clear legal foundations for the examination. As becomes evident in the individual chapters, there is a strong prima facie case for determining that crimes against humanity are being committed against the Rohingyas of North Arakan State in Burma...|$|R

In order to identify new candidates {{for inclusion in the}} acellular formulation, we used spontaneously released outer membrane vesicles (OMV) as a potential source of key adhesins. In {{the first part of the}} study, we employed a proteomic approach to quantify proteins in OMV purified from bacteria in the Bvg+ and Bvg- phase, thus comparing the outer membrane protein pattern of this pathogen in its virulent or avirulent state. Six of the most abundant outer membrane proteins were selected as candidates to be evaluated for their adhesive properties and vaccine potential. We generated E. coli strains singularly expressing the selected proteins and assessed their ability to adhere to lung epithelial cells in vitro. Four out of the selected proteins conferred adhesive ability to E. coli. Three of the candidates were specifically detected by anti-OMV mouse serum suggesting that these proteins are immunogenic antigens able to elicit an antibody response when displayed on the OMV. Anti-OMV serum was able to inhibit only BrkA-expressing E. coli adhesion to lung epithelial cells. Finally, stand-alone immunization of mice with recombinant BrkA resulted in significant protection against infection of the lower respiratory tract after challenge with B. pertussis. In the second part of the study, we demonstrated that OMV are naturally released by B. pertussis in a human ciliated airway cell infection model. The purified vesicles interact with host cells, their binding and uptake are strictly Bvg-regulated and OMV-associated PT contributes to host cell intoxication.

Global Positioning System (GPS) GPS is a satellite-based radio positioning system developed by the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) for accurate positioning and navigation. Radio signals are used from a constellation of earth-orbiting satellites to determine the 3 D position of a receiver. The system consists of 21 satellites and three spare satellites orbiting approximately 20, 000 km above the earth's surface in six orbital planes, having a period of 12 hours. GPS is an all-weather positioning system providing 24 hour <b>world-wide</b> <b>coverage</b> with at least four satellites in view at any time (Milliken et al., 1990 and Wells et al., 1986).

Air Force for the Joint Program Office (JPO) of the DOD. The system consists of five monitoring stations distributed around the world. The role of these stations is to monitor {{the health of the}} satellites.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{method to}} accurately map the shoreline of oceans, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers is proposed and verified in this work. The method {{is applied to}} multispectral satellite imagery in two stages. The first stage is a classification of each image pixel into land/water categories using the conventional 2 ̆ 7 dark pixel 2 ̆ 7 method. The approach presented here, makes use of a single shortwave IR image band (SWIR), if available. It {{is well known that}} SWIR has the least water leaving radiance and relatively little sensitivity to water pollutants and suspended sediments. It is generally the darkest (over water) and most reliable single band for land-water discrimination. The boundary of the water cover map determined in stage 1 underestimates the water cover and often misses the true shoreline by a quantity up to one pixel. A more accurate shoreline would be obtained by connecting the center point of pixels with exactly 50 - 50 mix of water and land. Then, stage 2 finds the 50 - 50 mix points. According to the method proposed, image data is interpolated and up-sampled to ten times the original resolution. The local gradient in radiance is used to find the direction to the shore, thus searching along that path for the interpolated pixel closest to a 50 - 50 mix. Landsat images with 30 m resolution, processed by this method, may thus provide the shoreline accurate to 3 m. Compared to similar approaches available in the literature, the method proposed discriminates sub-pixels crossed by the shoreline by using a criteria based on the absolute value of radiance, rather than its gradient. Preliminary experimentation of the algorithm shows that 10 m resolution accuracy is easily achieved and in some cases is often better than 5 m. The proposed method can be used to study long term shoreline changes by exploiting the 30 years of archived <b>world-wide</b> <b>coverage</b> Landsat imagery. Landsat imagery is free and easily accessible for downloading. Some applications that exploit the Landsat dataset and the new method are discussed in the companion poster...|$|E
40|$|Astronomical {{observatories}} {{that offer}} near-IR spectrographs can, in principle, {{be used as}} sites for monitoring greenhouse gases. In particular, observations for calibration purposes of so-called telluric standard stars are suitable. These are usually white dwarfs or hot stars, which show nearly no intrinsic spectral features in the required wavelength range. Therefore, absorption features in their spectrum arise mainly from {{the influence of the}} Earth's atmosphere and indicate its state and composition during the observation. Since calibration observations are taken several times per night, the temporal coverage is high. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) provides one of the world-wide largest telescope sites in the Atacama Desert of Chile. The Very Large Telescope located on Cerro Paranal (2635 m) consists of four 8 m class telescopes and a number of smaller ones incorporating a wide range of instruments. One of the most versatile instruments is X-Shooter, which has gone in operation in October 2009. It is a medium resolution spectrograph (R = 3000 - 18000) covering the entire wavelength range from 0. 3 - 2. 5 μm simultaneously. Therefore, spectral features of water, oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide are visible. We have taken all publically available X-Shooter spectra in the ESO data archive starting from October 2009 to establish a set of telluric standard star observations (~ 1400 per year). We have developed an algorithm which is able to determine molecular column densities by fitting spectral absorption features {{with the help of the}} LBLRTM radiative transfer code package and the HITRAN line database. By scaling molecular abundance profiles iteratively, a best fit is achieved incorporating a Levenberg-Marquard ? 2 -minimisation algorithm. A similar method based on spectroscopy and profile scaling is used by the TCCON network. This algorithm is applied to the X-Shooter spectra in order to determine a time-dependent evolution of the H 2 O, CH 4, and CO 2 content of the Earth's atmosphere over Cerro Paranal. Currently, a pilot study to estimate the accuracy is conducted. The results will be compared to measurements achieved by ground-based and satellite data for similar sites and latitudes. In principle, the same method can be applied to all data of appropriate spectrographs also on other telescope sites, leading to a coarse <b>world-wide</b> <b>coverage</b> of measurements. status: publishe...|$|E
