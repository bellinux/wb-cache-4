When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E

We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for the group with gruelling schedules including spending over thirteen weeks in America filming the first series of their show and their subsequent television specials, the members often felt that the travelling {{back and forth from}} the UK and the US was [...] "perhaps more tiring than what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> going out to America to do". Paul Cattermole once commented that the speed of the schedule sometimes caused a [...] "kind of dreamscape in your head", as the group often felt [...] "jetlagged and tired". On top of the filming schedules, the group often performed at high-profile pop music festivals such as Party in the Park where they performed for 100,000 fans. The intensity of the schedule would be a constant battle for the group and was going to continue to take its toll for all the years S Club 7 were together. In spite of this, the group always remained in solidarity that they were all good friends, [...] "cared for each other a lot" [...] and supported each other through difficult times in the group.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy and {{directed}} by Bradley Buecker. Two months before it aired, Murphy confirmed at PaleyFest 2011 {{that there was a}} death planned {{before the end of the}} season, but that it would not be recurring character Dave Karofsky, despite rumors that his death would be paving the way for Kurt's return to McKinley High. Further details were eventually supplied by entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello, who reported on April 19, 2011 that a [...] "beloved character" [...] would be dying in the [...] "season's penultimate episode", and one week later that the character was female. Morrison confirmed in late April that there would indeed be a death, and added: [...] "The episode right before the finale is called 'Funeral'. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> at a funeral home yesterday, shooting all day. It was a very taxing day." [...] The day the episode aired, Lynch revealed in an interview that Murphy had conferred with her before proceeding with the storyline: [...] "He took me aside at a party and said 'I want your blessing on this before we move forward.' I said, 'It sounds like a really great storyline.' It’s the thing that will break Sue Sylvester’s heart and get to where she lives." [...] Lynch was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for her work on the show, and submitted [...] "Funeral" [...] to be the episode by which she would be judged.|$|E

2500|$|Fisher {{was among}} the {{featured}} performers at the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness, and her fellow roasters' reliance on weight and menopause jokes. Fisher joked {{that she had no}} idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until [...] "they explained that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> good friends, and that apparently we have worked together." [...] Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne's struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity [...] "whose action figure is worth more than you are." ...|$|E

[...] "I'd like to officially thank Flagpole for introducing me to Greg Fiering and Migraine Boy.

[...] Doyle explained, [...] "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, {{we thought it would}} look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> using the knife upside down."

2500|$|Jackson {{planned to}} embark on a tour to promote 20 Y.O. after the album's release around March 2007, with rehearsals {{beginning}} in the end of the previous year. According to a Billboard report in September 2006, she and her choreographers were working on ideas for a world tour, but the singer was still not prepared to share these ideas. However, the unnamed tour was canceled after she signed a record deal with Island Records, and company executives asked her to record a new album instead, which became Discipline. Jackson stated, [...] "I was supposed to go on tour with the last album [...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> in full-blown tour rehearsals at that point ... learning numbers, getting everything together, set designs [...] I had to kind of shut everything down and go into the studio." ...|$|E

[...] "It really is just compression," [...] he said. [...] "We didn't create new situations." [...] He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film.
