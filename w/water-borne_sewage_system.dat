40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} <b>sewage</b> <b>systems,</b> {{evaluation}} of their technical conditions and various methods of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> reconstruction. First chapters provide theoretical background for <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> reconstruction and contains general information about <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> and basic terminology. Next chapters describe the theoretical procedure of elaboration of proposal of existing <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> remediation including {{the evaluation of}} technical conditions of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> and the evaluation of individual technical indicators. Then, individual methods of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> reconstruction are described. The second part of diploma thesis deals with the case study of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> {{in the village of}} Mikulovice. The case study is elaborated according to procedure specified in the theoretical part of diploma thesis. The case study includes the passportisation of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> and the evaluation of technical conditions of three selected sections. On the grounds of discovered defects, the methods of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> reconstruction are designed.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{capacity}} problem with the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> {{in the city of}} Ceska Skalice in the Czech Republic. With the knowledge of the sustainable drainage urban system (SuDs) a technical solution of dealing with the insufficient capacity of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> without having to change the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> can be designed. This thesis first of all, describes what SuDs is and how this particular system is applicated within the Czech Republic. There is also description of the stormwater and its impact on <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> in the urban areas. The second part of the work contains case study of applying chosen SuDs solution to solve the problem in the Ceska Skalice <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> There is the comparison of the condition of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> beforehand and after applying the SuDs. The concluding part of the thesis presents the results however, pros and cons of using the SuDs approach to improve better urban drainage system...|$|R

The {{operation}} of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> using the extended aeration method is discussed. The optimization of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> the occurring problems during operation, and the adequate corrective actions are also discussed, with suggestions of suitable processes (PCO, adsorption, constructed wetlands) for post-treatment of the petrochemical wastewater already treated by the activated sludge method.|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis deals with {{analysis of the}} ageing of concrete and reinforced concrete pipes in <b>sewage</b> <b>systems.</b> The ageing of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> is caused by several reasons, for example material abrasion, chemical and biological corrosion and subsequent static overload sewer construction. One of the common causes of degradation of <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> made from materials bonded with cement sealant is biogenic sulphate corrosion. Due to the corrosion the degradation of the pipe walls accelerates, particularly in {{upper part of the}} pipe and reduces planned lifetime of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> There is proposed new ageing analysis monitoring method for observation and evaluation of the loss of thickness of concrete and reinforced concrete pipes, which is caused by biogenic sulphate corrosion. Residual lifetime is calculated from the expected corrosion rate, it`s the loss of wall thickness on the monitored section of the sewer system. There is designed the monitoring system of the loss of wall thickness on the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> for practical application of the measurement procedure, which is administrated in cooperation with the BVK, a. s. The thesis uses existing knowledge regarding this subject. We use this information for better understanding of the process of the loss of wall thickness in <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> in real time and the posibility to correct and in-time implementation of appropriate operational measures. This should cause the limitation of the degradation process of piping material while extended service life and safe operation in <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> within the required time period. Based on the methodology is proposed to determine the residual life of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> and maintenance and rehabilitation can be done more effectively. There is needed to be noted that only long-term monitoring period can bring a better overview of the technical condition of <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> in time and thus better and more effective maintenance and rehabilitation, which is related to the effective...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the effect of water and <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> women’s and men’s work {{in the home and}} outside the home from a gender {{perspective}} in a rural area of Sweden. This study is a qualitative study conducted through interviews of senior citizen experiences of the life be-fore the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> installation and after the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> had been installed. The re-sults of the study are that life before the installation of the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> has been very gen-der segregated in Korpilombolo and especially troublesome for women. Life after the <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> installation, on the other hand, has eased the labor, especially for women, but they are still performing the work in the homes. The washing machine in particular was revolutionary. In the discussion, I have compared conditions today based on previous research and my own experiences on this. In addition to the interviews, the study relies on contemporary sources films from 1940 to 1970 era in Korpilombolo and some documentary photographs that de-scribe what I have said in my study.

40|$|The present degree thesis {{deals with}} modern methods for the {{maintenance}} and rehabilitation of <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> in particular with reference to public sewage networks. In {{the first section of}} the thesis the <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> is presented as a set of buildings used for the collection and drainage of waste waters and atmospheric waters from a defined area. The design of a functionally optimal system requires adequate planning that takes into consideration all factors that affect the quality of the operation of the <b>sewage</b> <b>system.</b> Optimal drainage of waste waters and the atmospheic waters accompained by minimal construction, operation, and maintenance costs can only be realized through high quality construction and operation, and regular maintenance of the entire system. Like in other sectors, progress and improvements have also been made in relation to <b>sewage</b> <b>system,</b> from their design, construction, operation, through maintenance. The thesis focuses on modern method or processes used for rehabilitation operation that exclude any digging and major spatial interventions. Domestic subcontractors that use the presented methods for the rehabilitations of <b>sewage</b> <b>system</b> operate under licences granted by foreign companies. Based on two concrete examples, the comparative cost analysis of a modern and a conventional method for the rehabilitation og <b>sewage</b> <b>systems</b> presents in the final part of my thesis has shown that despite numerous benefits modern rehabilitation methods are economically justified in certain cases only. Therefore, before each intervention a detailed analysis of the situation and rehabilitation costs has to be made, leading to the most appropriate and convenient solution in each examined case...|$|R
