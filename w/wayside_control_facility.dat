40|$|Jong-Hyen Baek) Abstract – To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} and safety of railway systems, the train control system has been considerably evolved from the ground-equipment-based control system (e. g. track circuit, interlocking system, etc.) into the on-board-equipment-based control system. In addition, this train control system enables the rolling stock to intelligently <b>control</b> the trackside <b>facilities</b> by introducing the {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT). Accordingly, since the ICT-based train control system makes the railway system be simplified (i. e. the heavy ground-equipment can be removed), the efficient and cost-effective railway system can be realized. In this paper, we perform the feasibility test of the ICT-based train control system via a simulation. To this end, we have developed the prototypes of the on-board controller and <b>wayside</b> object <b>control</b> units which control the point and crossing gate and performed the integrated operation simulation in a testbed. In this paper, before the field test of the on-board-controller-based train control system, we perform the Consecutive operation test for prototypes of the on-board controller, <b>wayside</b> object <b>control</b> unit...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} the optimal {{location}} of <b>control</b> <b>facilities</b> in an urban area for improving security in case of large events or critical situations is presented. The paper focuses on the prevention of threats by the control and/or the interdiction of people and vehicle flows entering an area (restricted zone). In general, limited available resources do not allow monitoring all the access points of the area. So it is fundamental to identify the most suitable points where <b>control</b> <b>facilities</b> should be located. Two flow intercepting facility location models will be presented: {{the first one is}} devoted to identify the best location of a limited number of <b>control</b> <b>facilities</b> to maximise the security level; the second one is aimed at computing the minimum number of <b>control</b> <b>facilities</b> able to guarantee a prescribed level of security. Results obtained on test cases representative of different urban structures are presented...|$|R
