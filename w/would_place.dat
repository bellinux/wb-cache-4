5|$|At SummerSlam 1992 in August, The Undertaker {{defeated}} Kamala. Harvey Wippleman, Kamala's manager wanted revenge, so {{a rematch}} {{was scheduled for}} Survivor Series. The match was promoted as the WWF's first coffin match, in which the winner <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the loser in a coffin after the match.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the courtyard firmly in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to redeem the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
50|$|On August 25, the NEC {{confirmed}} the provisional results, {{announced that the}} second round of the presidential election <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> on September 8, and said that second round campaigning <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> from August 25 until September 6.|$|R
25|$|A {{statement}} by Minister of State for Children Brian Lenihan in November 2006 {{suggested that the}} election <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> in May 2007, as was the case. In December 2006, Bertie Ahern stated unambiguously that the election <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> in summer 2007.|$|R
25|$|From 2001-17, the Championship {{was played}} using the Quarter-finals format. Under this format Provincial matches <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> {{during the months}} of May, June and July. The winners {{of each of the}} four Provincial Championships <b>would</b> earn a <b>place</b> in the All-Ireland Quarter-Finals, which <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> in the month of August. Replays would be played for all drawn matches, not just drawn Provincial Finals and drawn All-Ireland Finals. Extra-time would only be used for Replays and Qualifier Matches. If the teams were still level after extra time, the {{qualifier}} match would go to a replay {{or in the case of}} replays, another replay <b>would</b> take <b>place.</b>|$|R
5|$|Opponents of a {{northern}} location counter that this site is {{not supported by}} the historical sources, and that this <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times {{printed a}} display {{advertisement}} {{on its first}} page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper. The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page. The newspaper promised it <b>would</b> <b>place</b> first-page advertisements on only {{the lower half of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|With two authors at {{the time}} Holmes {{decided to have a}} {{pseudonym}} since having two authors <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the books at different places at libraries, confusing and possibly scaring off potential readers. The last name Hunter was chosen since it put the books next to the Redwall series which has a similar genre.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 end times {{prediction}} made by American Christian {{radio host}} Harold Camping {{stated that the}} Rapture and Judgment Day <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> on May 21, 2011, and {{that the end of}} the world <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> five months later on October 21, 2011.|$|R
25|$|All-Ireland Semi Finals: The All-Ireland Semi Finals <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> in August and be contested by {{the four}} winners of the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.

50|$|Ancient Greek temples were {{dedicated}} to a certain deity. A typical temple would have a statue inside. An altar <b>would</b> be <b>placed</b> outside, upon which offerings <b>would</b> be <b>placed</b> as sacrifices to the city's patron deity. The Parthenon is a famous example of an Ancient Greek temple.|$|R
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it <b>would</b> <b>place</b> him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E
5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans <b>would</b> <b>place</b> their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which <b>would</b> <b>place</b> it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

50|$|A twelve-round {{provisional}} calendar {{was revealed}} on January 26, 2016 with the sixth, {{seventh and eighth}} round to be announced, though it was certain the sixth and seventh round <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> on a military base. On March 3, 2016 GRC announced the eighth round <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> in Atlantic City and on June 1, 2016 GRC announced the sixth and seventh round <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> at the Marine Corps Air Station New River.

5|$|In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle {{reported}} that £10 in silver {{had been stolen}} from Golding Spearman, keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen. When the police were unable to identify the culprit, Spearman turned to Murrell, who asserted that he <b>would</b> <b>place</b> a spell on the thief which {{would result in the}} return of the money. Shortly after, a soldier discovered the stolen money and returned it to Spearman, who attributed its retrieval to Murrell.|$|E
5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|Representations of America as {{a female}} Native American, or Indian princess, dated back to the 16thcentury; cartographers <b>would</b> <b>place</b> a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent. This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia eventually came to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E

[...] "Stretchers" [...] <b>would</b> be <b>placed</b> so the longer side was {{on the face of the}} wall, and [...] "headers" [...] <b>would</b> be <b>placed</b> so the shorter side was on the face of the wall, and would thus extend further back into the wall thickness. Various {{patterns}} could be produced by changing how the blocks were placed, and it was common to strengthen the wall by ensuring that the joints between blocks were centered over the blocks in the row below.|$|R

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which <b>would</b> <b>place</b> it in the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile {{looking down at the}} left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Aneirin {{manuscript}} is {{from the}} later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh. The early date <b>would</b> <b>place</b> its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd ("Old North"); as such {{it would have been}} written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic. Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.|$|E
5|$|The {{disagreements}} {{between the}} leading barons {{involved in the}} revolt soon became evident. De Montfort championed radical reforms that <b>would</b> <b>place</b> further limitations on the authority {{and power of the}} major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as de Clare, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers. Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical Provisions of Westminster in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} is completed, and Remmick informs both Picard and Quinn {{that there is}} no sign of wrongdoing, and expresses his interest in joining its crew in the future. Quinn tells Picard that he feels there is an unknown force that has infiltrated Starfleet, and he was seeking to assure himself of his trust in Picard and the Enterprise crew. To help combat this threat, Quinn offers Picard a promotion to Admiral and a job overseeing Starfleet Academy which <b>would</b> <b>place</b> Picard near Quinn at all times. Picard mulls the offer for some time, but eventually declines.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the high ground, <b>would</b> <b>place</b> the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its observational importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous observational position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E

The Rapture, in a {{specific}} tradition of premillennial theology, is the taking up into heaven of God's elect people.|$|R
50|$|However, he {{held that}} it was not {{appropriate}} to add the entire estimated cost of the obligations to the proceeds, preferring to restrict the amount added back to the estimated cost that <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> within the 12 months following each sale, plus 20 percent of the estimated cost of the activities that <b>would</b> take <b>place</b> thereafter.|$|R
