25|$|Cronkite was {{replaced}} as anchor {{of the program}} the Monday after his retirement, March 9, 1981, by then 49-year-old Dan Rather, {{who had been with}} CBS News as a correspondent since the early 1960s and later became a correspondent for the network's newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Concerns about excessive liberalism in the media were frequently leveled at Rather, the CBS Evening News, CBS News and CBS in general. Some of these concerns dated from Rather's position as <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> <b>for</b> the network's news division during the Nixon administration. An interview related to the Iran–Contra affair with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush where the two engaged in a shouting match on live television did little to dispel those concerns. Rather apologized for his behavior in statements the following day.|$|E

After noting its status {{as one of the}} oldest coffeehouses in Portland, Fodor's said in a Pacific Northwest guide that it remains [...] "one of the best", specifically complimenting the desserts.

Similarly, Portland Examiner contributor Dominique Dobson called the coffeehouse [...] "whimsical" [...] and wrote, [...] "this is a great evening stopoff for caffeine and dessert. It can sometimes be a bit crowded, but the mocha fudge cake is phenomenal with coffee, and the quirky clientele and (sometimes live) music can keep you lingering over that amazing cheesecake!" [...] In his 2010 Frommer's guide titled Portable Portland, Karl Samson noted the coffeehouse's loyal patrons, calling it [...] "Portland's favorite dessert hangout for more than 25 years." [...] Julian Smith wrote in a 2012 Frommer's guide, Portland Day by Day, that Rimsky-Korsakoffee is the [...] "most atmospheric" [...] of the city's coffee establishments, with [...] "fun and sassy" [...] waiters, desserts [...] "to die for" [...] and bathrooms [...] "you have to see to believe".

5000|$|In 1943 the National Negro Publishers Association (NNPA) {{petitioned the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>Correspondents</b> Association (WHCA) <b>for</b> press {{credentials}} {{on the grounds}} that the Atlanta Daily World was one of its member papers. All other African American papers at the time were weeklies, and the press credentials were limited to reporters for daily papers. The WHCA agreed but it took several more months before the NNPA could afford to open its own Washington bureau and hire McAlpin as its full-time Washington correspondent. In February 1944 he attended his first presidential press conference and was greeted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who shook his hand and said, “I’m glad to see you, McAlpin, and very happy to have you here.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Heymann {{thought he}} started out nervous, defensively {{saying that he was}} [...] "not out to get the {{president}} …" [...] Once he got into the details of the history and significance of the dispute over the tapes, which involved a patient explanation of criminal procedure, evidence, administrative and constitutional law, he relaxed. Doyle said: [...] "He was folksy, unpretentious, disarming. He seemed the country lawyer, talking good sense." [...] While he used simple terms and short sentences, he was not patronizing or supercilious. [...] "He offered a masterful professorial performance, designed to explain the legal and constitutional confrontation in terms that struck {{at the core of the}} layman's treasured values essential to the American system." [...] He defended established institutions and regular procedure. By contrast, the president's proposal involved deciding that a [...] "court order would not be obeyed." [...] In the place of evidence, which Cox sought, the president proposed providing [...] "summaries" [...] while the genuine, irrefutable evidence, the tapes of what actually transpired, would be available to only two or three men [...] "all but one of them the aides to the president and men who have been associated with those who are the subject of the investigation." [...] In describing the course of the negotiations for all information, he showed how the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> lawyers had stalled from the beginning. But he never attacked anyone, at one point taking Buzhardt off the hook; [...] "he has behaved in dealing with me in an entirely honorable way —except that he's too damn slow." [...] With the questions that followed, Cox spent more than an hour, at the end of which his staff handed out copies of the various proposals and correspondence that took place during the week. It was so persuasive a performance that Sarah McClendon, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> known <b>for</b> her sharp questions, approached Cox and said: [...] "I want to shake your hand, you are a great American." [...] Doyle wrote that it was [...] "the most unusual press conference I have ever attended. The hard-bitten, cynical press corps was rooting for Archibald Cox." [...] John Douglas said: [...] "It was one of the most spectacular performances, one of two or three press conference ever held in this country which have had a significant effect on public opinion." ...|$|R

[...] Schorr was called [...] "reliably liberal", and was [...] "widely regarded as a liberal" [...] according to another source, though he regarded the label as inaccurate.|$|E
2500|$|Many guests {{appear on}} the show expressing a variety of points of view on diverse social and {{political}} topics. Some guests proffer progressive views similar to Hartmann's, but more than half are conservatives, libertarians, or Ayn Rand Institute members who espouse opposing views. Due to his eagerness to invite people who disagree with him, vigorous discussion and debate between the host and guests usually ensues; [...] "My goal in my conversations with conservatives is not to create a spectacle, and not to win the argument, not to prove that I'm the smartest guy in the room or that I'm a tough warrior and I can smack down people." [...] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appears every Friday during the first hour of the show titled [...] "Brunch with Bernie".
