Though there are several athletes in her family, she is not {{particularly}} fond of sports. [...] "I was on a football team when I was in third grade. But I {{was so bad that}} I wasn't allowed to play in a match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> different types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to know how people lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to work harder than everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

500|$|Impressed with Tomohiko Kira's guitar playing, Mitsuda {{laid out}} plans after Creid {{to have him}} perform in Chrono Cross, {{resulting}} in the latter game's ending song [...] "Radical Dreamers ~Jewel which Cannot be Stolen~". During their stay in Ireland, Mitsuda and the Creid album coordinator attended a live set of the folk band Lúnasa in a pub. As Mitsuda liked the concert, the coordinator encouraged the Irish band to do a Japanese live tour. No other Xenogears album has been produced by Square Enix after Creid, but an officially licensed tribute album titled Xenogears Light: An Arranged Album was published in limited quantities by the fan group OneUp Studios in 2005. The album features 20 tracks arranged from the Xenogears score and performed with acoustic instruments, such as piano, flute, guitar, and violin. An unofficial album of remixes titled Humans + Gears was produced as a digital album by OverClocked Remix on October 19, 2009 consisting of 33 tracks on two [...] "discs". While Creid is the only album released by the ensemble dubbed [...] "Millennial Fair", Mitsuda said in 2002 that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> bringing back the formation, in some way, for another project. In February 2011, Square Enix released , a second arranged album of music from the game, in an orchestral style.|$|E
500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
500|$|A {{representative}} for Jive Records stated that although Spears {{was working in}} the studio, [...] "no album is scheduled at the moment" [...] and [...] "there are no plans to service 'Mona Lisa' to radio."

In an interview with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, commenting she missed [...] "traveling [...] the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. I needed a break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and where you came from. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner. But you never know", she stated. She also said that she hoped the album would reinvigorate the current pop scene, adding that [...] "It's been boring. Nothing's been wow to me." [...] On May 9, 2006, Spears announced she was pregnant with her second child. A few days later, producers such as J. R. Rotem and Sean Garrett told MTV News they were working with Spears. On September 12, 2006, Spears gave birth to her second son, Jayden James. She filed for divorce from Federline on November 7, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences. After the divorce, her partying and public behaviour drew attention from the worldwide media, and ended with two separate stints at Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility in February 2007. Her manager Larry Rudolph released a statement on March 20, 2007, saying that she [...] "successfully complet their program." ...|$|E

In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, Davidson participated on {{the celebrity}} reality TV {{programme}} Hell's Kitchen. During {{his time on}} the show, Davidson attracted negative media attention over what was identified as homophobic bullying towards TV presenter and openly gay contestant Brian Dowling. Davidson asked Dowling, [...] "Are you on our side?" [...] when referring {{to whether or not}} he would be participating for the boys' or girls' team. Davidson used the word [...] "shirt-lifters" [...] in front of him, and was constantly asking if Dowling <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> on one of [...] "John Virgo's lovely waistcoats", which Davidson owns. Davidson later described himself as a [...] "homophobic arsehole". The programme was broadcast on ITV on 4 September 2007. On 10 September, Davidson asked to leave Hell's Kitchen following further problems with Dowling. After Davidson's exit from the programme, the BBC reported that the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom had received 46 complaints alleging that Davidson had bullied Dowling. Ofcom concluded that nothing unacceptable had happened. ITV, the channel which had originally broadcast the programme, issued a statement, regretting Davidson's [...] "unacceptable remarks".|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, is {{told that}} the gravestone of his dead wife Sue has been vandalized with an {{inverted}} version of Superman's [...] "S" [...] symbol, the Kryptonian symbol for resurrection. He confronts Cassandra Sandsmark, and she tells Dibny that {{she is in a}} cult which believes that Superboy can be resurrected, but they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it first with Sue. Despite his initial consent, Dibny and his friends disrupt the ceremony, and the effigy of Sue crawls to Dibny, calling out to him as it burns; Dibny suffers a nervous breakdown as a result. Ralph seeks out the helmet of Doctor Fate, which promises to revive Sue if he makes certain sacrifices. With unwilling assistance of a demon he tied into knots using Gingold, Dibny journeys with the helmet through the afterlives of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic for personal gain. After several failed attempts to resurrect his wife, Dibny prepares a spell in Doctor Fate's home, the Tower of Nabu. Dibny puts the helmet on, points the gun at his temple, then shoots the helmet to reveal it is actually the sorcerer Felix Faust. Faust was posing as Nabu to give Dibny's soul to the demon Neron in exchange for his freedom. Neron kills Dibny, but realizes too late that Dibny's spell has trapped him and Faust inside a circle of binding that can only be undone by the person who originally created it. With Ralph's death, Neron and Faust are seemingly trapped together in the tower for all eternity. Ralph and Sue Dibny are reunited in death as ghost detectives.|$|E
