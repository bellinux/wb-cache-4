5|$|Despite Bringing Up Babys {{reputation}} as a flop, it was successful {{in some parts of}} the U.S. The film premiered on February 16, 1938 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco (where it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit),</b> and was also successful in Los Angeles, Portland, Denver, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C.. However, it was a financial disappointment in the Midwest, as well as most other cities in the country, including NYC; to RKO's chagrin, the film's premiere in New York on March 3, 1938 at Radio City Music Hall made only $70,000 and it was pulled after one week in favor of Jezebel with Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together.

Having secured the rights to the farce Charley's Aunt, they produced it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E

The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box office. Soon she received the first of her Academy Award nominations for Edward, My Son, a 1949 drama set in England that co-starred Spencer Tracy.|$|E
5|$|The Demi-Virgin is a three-act play {{written by}} Avery Hopwood. Producer Albert H. Woods staged it on Broadway, where it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> during the 1921–22 season.

Nevertheless, Pirates <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it {{became one of the most}} frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit,</b> one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Terry-Thomas {{began his}} stage career with an {{appearance}} in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London; the show <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> and {{he appeared in}} it from September 1946 until January 1948. In 1949 he appeared in his first television programme, Technical Hitch, and scored a success later that year with his own television series, How Do You View?, which was noted for being the first comedy series on British television. In 1956 he was cast by the Boulting brothers in Private's Progress. The role boosted his film career, initially in Britain, and then in America. In 1958 Terry-Thomas released {{the first of two}} solo comedy records, Strictly T-T; the same year he also appeared as Bertie Wooster in a cast recording of Jeeves, with Roger Livesey playing Jeeves.|$|E
5|$|The X-Files <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> for the Fox {{network and}} {{received}} largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, {{it turned into}} a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by the end it was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes The Lone Gunmen spin-off, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. After the final theatrical film in 2008, fans continued to push for a third movie to conclude the series' plot lines, and in March 2015, Fox eventually announced that the series would return, with Chris Carter as executive producer and writer, and Duchovny, Anderson, Pileggi, Davis, and Gish all reprising their roles.|$|E
