5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the <b>wing</b> <b>spar.</b>|$|E

25|$|Beginning in June 1991, senior {{engineers}} {{met with}} FAA officials to discuss {{concerns over the}} Aero Commander's main <b>wing</b> <b>spar,</b> which {{was believed to be}} susceptible to stress fatigue and subsequent cracking, and was believed to have resulted in a number of fatal crashes.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1959 RAAF A89-308 crashed at RAAF Richmond, NSW, Australia. All eight crew died. The port engine {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} causing a fuel leak in the wheel well. The resulting fire severed the magnesium <b>wing</b> <b>spar,</b> and the aircraft {{fell from the}} sky before the crew could bail out.|$|E
25|$|The {{airworthiness}} {{design requirements}} {{applicable to the}} Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport category aeroplanes did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush. Similarly, the airworthiness maintenance requirements did not require periodic inspection for fatigue cracking of the wing spars.|$|E

25|$|Rutan later {{revised the}} VariEze design, {{providing}} more volume for fuel and cargo, {{resulting in the}} Rutan model 61 Long-EZ, designed to be powered by a Lycoming O-235, although some have used Lycoming O-320s or Lycoming O-360s. The Long-EZ also has a revised <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> design that {{is not subject to}} the 2.5g positive, 1.5g negative, maximum load factor limit applied to the VariEze after the discovery of problems with some VariEze wings.|$|E
25|$|The wheeled {{undercarriage}} was {{a simple}} single-axle arrangement, with oleo legs forward to the engine bulkhead and rearward bracing struts {{to the root of}} the rear <b>wing</b> <b>spar.</b> There was a rather long tailskid to protect the downward-extended fin. The seaplane version used a pair of floats, their low drag profile refined via Schneider Trophy experience, cross braced with a pair of horizontal transverse struts. They were mounted with N-shaped struts which sloped strongly outwards from the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{adopted a}} new {{philosophy}} for the attachment of the A350s main undercarriage {{as part of}} the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.|$|E
50|$|Assembly of the glider {{is typical}} of modern gliders, with forked <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> joined by two steel pins. The wings each weigh only 32 kg (71 lb).|$|R
50|$|The biplane racer used an all-wood {{fuselage}} with birch paneling. The <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> {{were also}} wood with fabric covering. Uniquely, the aileron hinges {{were made of}} leather.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} whether the HP-17 {{actually}} flew, but the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> that Schreder developed for it found good use on Schreder's next and most popular kit sailplane, the HP-18.|$|R
25|$|In 1977, {{a single}} {{standard}} BN-2 was re-engined with Dowty Rotol ducted fans. The ducted fan produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion, some structural {{strengthening of the}} main <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> at the root was required due to the extra weight. This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the ducted fan {{as a means of}} reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, {{the initial}} {{one-piece}} <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> came onto the assembly jig {{and is about}} to enter lay-up in June, first parts assembly for the initial -9, a static test airframe is underway in the purpose-built wing center near Everett, Washington. Four -9s and a fatigue-test airframe along two -8s will be built for testing. Tests of avionics, power and integrated systems continue in Boeing Field laboratories and will be integrated into an “Airplane Zero” in 2017 as 70% detailed design was done in June 2017.|$|E
25|$|Chalk's Ocean Airways {{purchased}} Mallard N1208 {{from the}} Fruehauf Corporation and later acquired several {{other examples of}} the aircraft. The type received much attention after a Turbo Mallard, operating as Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101, crashed after takeoff from Miami Harbor on 19 December 2005 bound for Bimini, Bahamas. Eighteen passengers and two crew perished when the right wing separated from the fuselage of the 58-year-old aircraft. The cause of the accident {{was determined by the}} subsequent investigation to be undetected cracks and/or corrosion in the <b>wing</b> <b>spar.</b>|$|E

25|$|Baumann was {{an early}} expert in {{light-weight}} construction techniques and placed the four engines in nacelles mounted between {{the upper and lower}} wing decks to distribute the loads to save weight in the <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lil Bitts is {{a single}} seat biplane with {{conventional}} landing gear constructed from welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering. The <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> are constructed of aluminum tubing with aluminum ribs and fabric covering.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, due to {{a series}} of crashes {{involving}} in-flight structural failure during simulated combat flights, the entire US civilian fleet of T-34A/Bs was grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding has since been eased to a slate of restrictions on the permitted flight envelope. Via a series of Airworthiness Directives (ADs) established by or Alternate Methods of Compliance (AMOCs) negotiated with the FAA, including installation of certain, approved structural modifications to the <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> and other repairs, the T-34A and T-34B fleet in 2011 has been restored to full flight status by FAA at the Mentor's originally designed limitations, provided each individual example is compliant with those ADs and AMOCs.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{fuselage}} {{was destroyed in}} the fire. Exceptions included the nose and {{the underside of the}} cockpit. The tips of the wings and ailerons were nearly undamaged. The front <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> was sufficiently intact that it was able to keep the wings together. The inner parts of the wing, including the spoilers, were destroyed, but two of the spoiler actuators were salvageable. The tail was largely intact. Most light alloy components in the engines were destroyed, although the compressor blades were intact and showed no sign of damage prior to impact. Three components – the left main landing gear, an engine cowling and the outer right engine – were found between the runway and the wreckage, and had not been consumed in fire.|$|E
25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows with a seat {{on each side of the}} aisle, as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to step over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E
50|$|Two {{modifications}} (Service Bulletin 61DA for S/N 0102-2007 and Service Bulletin 79 for S/N 1201-2806) {{were made}} to strengthen the <b>wings</b> <b>spars</b> for the extreme loads experienced during unlimited aerobatics; and no further failures occurred.|$|R
50|$|The {{company is}} one of five major Japanese {{companies}} contracted to build parts for Boeing's 777X aircraft, specifically the fairings that connect the wings to the fuselage. ShinMaywa also produces <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> for the Boeing 787.|$|R
50|$|Wood <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> of multipiece {{construction}} usually {{consist of}} {{upper and lower}} members, called spar caps, and vertical sheet wood members, known as shear webs or more simply webs, that span {{the distance between the}} spar caps.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} from Laos {{participated in}} the early phase of the Vietnam War with the USAF, but with Vietnamese markings as part of Project Farm Gate. Though Farm Gate operated B-26Bs, B-26Cs, and genuine RB-26Cs, many of these aircraft were operated under the designation RB-26C, though they were used in a combat capacity. During 1963, two RB-26C were sent to Clark AB in the Philippines for modifications, though not with night systems as with those modified for Black Watch. The two aircraft returned from Black Watch to Farm Gate were subsequently given the designation RB-26L to distinguish them from other modified RB-26C, and were assigned to Project Sweet Sue. Farm Gate's B-26s operated alongside the other primary strike aircraft of the time, the T-28 Trojan, before both aircraft types were replaced by the Douglas A-1 Skyraider. The B-26s were withdrawn from service in February 1964 after two accidents related to <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> fatigue, one during combat in Southeast Asia in August 1963 and one during an airpower demonstration at Eglin AFB, Florida in February 1964.|$|E

The length was {{necessary}} for the plutonium [...] "bullet" [...] to pick up adequate speed before reaching the [...] "target". Weight was around [...] for the final weapon model. There was only one aircraft in the Allied inventory that could carry a Thin Man unmodified: the British Avro Lancaster. However, the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress could be modified to carry it by removing part of the main <b>wing</b> <b>spar</b> and some oxygen tanks located between its two bomb bays.|$|E

On the last mission, the third aircraft, commanded by Captain John Butterfield, was seriously damaged by ground fire. Although he managed to land at Chu Lai, the aircraft was a total loss due to a warped <b>wing</b> <b>spar.</b> For his actions on that day, Capt. Butterfield received the Silver Star medal. It was decided that the experiment didn't justify the risk, and the mission was officially cancelled.|$|E
