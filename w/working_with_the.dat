40|$|Background: Sick leave {{within the}} police has {{increased}} {{in recent years and}} the highest increase has been seen among female police officers over 50 years. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify the presence of physical symptoms, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization of female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling and police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation in <b>the</b> North region of Sweden. Method: The study was conducted with web-based questionnaire, answered by female police officers: police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling (n= 40) and police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation (n= 44) in the North region of Sweden. The survey consisted of a total of 37 questions. To measure burnout Maslach Burnout Inventory was used. Results: A significant difference was seen {{in the presence of the}} physical symptom headache between female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling and female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation. <b>The</b> group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation reported higher incidence of headaches than <b>the</b> group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> intervention. Furthermore <b>the</b> group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling have estimated depersonalization (DP) higher than <b>the</b> group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling (n= 40) and police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation (n= 44) in the North region of Sweden.
