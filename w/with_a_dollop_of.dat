500|$|Clotted {{cream is}} an {{essential}} part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional [...] "splits" [...] in Cornwall—with strawberry jam (other flavours are generally less acceptable), along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dollop</b> <b>of</b> cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire Teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for [...] "Devon cream tea" [...] to have protected designation of origin similar to [...] "Cornish clotted cream". One variation on a cream tea is called [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup, honey, or treacle.|$|E

5000|$|Mbaqanga {{developed}} in the South African shebeens during the 1960s. Its use of western instruments allowed mbaqanga to develop into a South African version of jazz. Musically, the sound indicated a mix between western instrumentation and South African vocal style. Many mbaqanga scholars consider {{it to be the}} result of a coalition between marabi and kwela. A South African tourist website sponsored by the government describes mbaqanga as [...] "the cyclic structure of marabi [...] [...] [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>dollop</b> <b>of</b> American big band swing thrown on top." [...] Mbaqanga also provided a very early forum for black and white interaction in a segregated country. As a result, the [...] "white Nationalist government brought this vital era to an end" [...] by razing the townships that supported mbaqanga such as Sophiatown.|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} music the Makgona Tsohle Band {{and its members}} help develop and play was Mbaqanga, (pronounced mm-bah-KAHNG-guh, with the K formed by popping the tongue off {{the roof of the}} mouth), takes its name from a Zulu word for an {{everyday}} cornmeal porridge or steamed cornbread (implying the home-made quality of the music's origin), had its roots in the 1950s. The style was a fusion of traditional Zulu, Sotho, Shangaan, and Xhosa music, fused with Marabi (also known as South African Jazz), and Kwela, and with modern (electric instruments), American R&B, soul, and gospel. The cyclic structure of marabi melded with traditional dance styles such as the Zulu indlamu, combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>dollop</b> <b>of</b> American big band swing thrown on top. The indlamu input dance style developed into the [...] "African stomp" [...] style, giving a notably African rhythmic impulse to the music. The pairing of mbaqanga with vocals became known as [...] "mgqashiyo", meaning [...] "to bounce", after the [...] "bouncy" [...] rhythms of the style or simanje-manje music (in Zulu, meaning [...] "now-now"). Marks Mankwane of the Makgona Tsohle Band said in an interview, [...] "When we started this group. we decided also to start our own style of music, and that was Mbaqanga. So we decided to bring in Western style drums and more guitars and put the tempo up for dancing, and that's where the Western Influence comes in. On top of the band's rhythms was added the harmonies of the Mahotella Queens.... To set off the Queens came lead singer Mahlathini's extraordinary rasping, deep bass voice." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} as the Seventh Annual Anthony Kennedy lecture at the Lewis & Clark School of Law on September 23, 2015.  My topic was Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in the recent Obergefell case, recognizing {{a constitutional right to}} same-sex marriage.  In the first part of my lecture, I placed the Obergefell opinion in context, taking into account Justice Kennedy's place on the current Court, and his past jurisprudence.  In particular, I noted that while Justice Kennedy is undoubtedly the co-called "swing Justice" on the Roberts Court, he is quite different from past swing Justices such as Sandra Day O'Connor and Lewis Powell.  The latter were considered to be moderate pragmatists, lacking strong judicial philosophies.  Not so for Justice Kennedy.  From his first years on the Court, his jurisprudence has been notable for a passionate commitment to Liberty in all of its aspect, and his firm belief that protection for Liberty is intrinsically tied to protection of individual Dignity.  This commitment appears in his  privacy jurisprudence of course (culminating in Obergefell), but also in other areas including notably free.  Moreover, unlike his colleagues, Justice Kennedy's commitment to liberty transcends political boundaries, encompassing such "liberal" Liberty claims as abortion and the free speech rights of pornographers, and such "conservative" claims as property rights and commercial speech.   I then raised some doubts about the reasoning in Obergefell.  I noted that the plaintiffs in the case had raised both Due Process (i. e., Liberty), and Equal Protection (i. e., Equality) claims, and the Court's formulation of the questions presented preserved both.  Yet Kennedy's opinion is almost all Liberty, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tiny <b>dollop</b> <b>of</b> Equality.  I suggested that this emphasis is probably a product of Kennedy's own preferences and comfort levels.  While Justice Kennedy has always been a strong advocate of Liberty claims, his relationship to Equality is more ambivalent.  He unquestionably is firmly committed to nondiscrimination principles, and even (unlike his conservative colleagues) committed to racial integration.  However, he has demonstrated [...] notably in the Parents Involved decision [...]  grave discomfort with policies that classify individuals based on qualities such as race.  Indeed, this discomfort ties into his commitment to Dignity, because he sees such typecasting as itself in consistent with individual Dignity.  As a consequence, Liberty must have seemed the easier path to take.   Ultimately, however, I do believe this choice was a mistake, for several reasons.  First, I think that jurisprudentially, Equality is the stronger argument.  The Court's entire substantive due process jurisprudence, which was the basis of the Due Process holding in Obergefell, rests on somewhat shaky foundations, given its lack of textual grounding.  Equal Protection, on the other hand, is a well-established, textually based doctrine; and the argument for extending heightened scrutiny to discrimination against LGBT individuals strikes me as extremely powerful, under existing precedent.  Second, an Equality based holding would have been broader, granting more protections to sexual minorities than a narrow decision focused on marriage.  Third, it is possible that an Equality based holding would have generated less intense opposition than a holding that redefines marriage (though this is admittedly speculative).  Finally, I also believe that Justice Jackson was correct in his argument, in the Railway Express case, that in a democracy, equality-based constitutional decisions are generally preferable to liberty-based ones, because they interfere less with legislative authority...|$|R
