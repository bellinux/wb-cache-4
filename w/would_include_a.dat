5|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from the Mark 1, the developers concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths. They therefore embarked {{on the design of}} a new machine which <b>would</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> floating point unit; work began in 1951. The resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, as well as quicker at solving maths problems. Ferranti produced a commercial version marketed as the Ferranti Mercury, in which the Williams tubes were replaced by the more reliable core memory.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Sukhoi {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch <b>would</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast.

Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E
5|$|Kilburn and Williams {{concluded}} that computers {{would be used}} more in scientific roles than pure maths, and decided {{to develop a new}} machine that <b>would</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> floating point unit.

5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which <b>would</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E
