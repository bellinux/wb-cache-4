5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating <b>water-plantain</b> (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

Over 70 aquatic and bankside vascular plants have been recorded including frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), wood club-rush (Scirpus sylvaticus) and lesser <b>water-plantain</b> (Baldellia ranunculoides). Over 100 species of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the ditches including one nationally rare soldier fly, (Odontomyia ornata) and 13 nationally scarce species including the water beetles Agabus uliginosus, Hydaticus transversalis and Helophorus nanus. In winter the flooded fields provide food for large numbers of waterfowl with several thousand lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), hundreds of snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and smaller numbers of golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) regularly present. Over two hundred Bewick's swans (Cygnus bewickii) have been recorded, making the site an internationally important wintering ground for this species. Raptor species such as short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), merlin (Falco columbarius) and peregrine (Falco peregrinus) regularly hunt over the site in winter. Vertebrate species present include grass snake (Natrix natrix) and common frog Rana temporaria. Otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly recorded on the site.|$|E

50|$|Alisma plantago-aquatica, {{also known}} as European <b>water-plantain,</b> common <b>water-plantain</b> or mad-dog weed, is a {{perennial}} flowering plant widespread across most of Europe and Asia from Portugal and Morocco to Japan, Kamchatka and Vietnam. It is also regarded as native in northern and central Africa {{as far south as}} Tanzania. It is reportedly naturalized in southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State and Connecticut. Some sources maintain that the species is widespread across North America, but these reports appear to have been based on misidentified specimens. It is found on mud or in fresh waters.|$|E
50|$|Luronium natans {{can be a}} {{difficult}} plant to identify. It is both very variable and resembles many other aquatic plants with strap-like leaves such as bur-reeds (Sparganium), young <b>water-plantain</b> plants (Alisma), arrowheads (Sagittaria), lesser <b>water-plantain</b> (Baldellia) and mudwort (Limosella aquatica). The stoloniferous habit is an important distinguishing feature, and the unusual shape of the floating leaves, which are rounded at the tips and tend to taper gradually into the stem, is also helpful. However, floating leaves are not always present, especially in lake populations. Submerged leaves have a characteristic ladder pattern with whitish flecks when seen underwater.|$|E

50|$|The {{ecology of}} {{floating}} <b>water-plantain</b> in ponds {{is not well}} understood, but generally it seems to require broadly low nutrient, soft water situations with some disturbance, such as lowland heathland pools subject to grazing by livestock.|$|E
50|$|Floating <b>water-plantain</b> {{appears to}} require {{a certain amount of}} {{disturbance}} to survive as it is a poor competitor, and therefore does best in situations where there {{is a certain amount of}} disturbance to suppress the growth of competing species. In Llyn Egnant and Llyn Teifi (Wales, UK), which are used as reservoirs for public water supply, floating <b>water-plantain</b> probably benefits from the resulting increase in water level fluctuation, suppressing competition from other aquatic plants and promoting flowering. However, in sites where water level fluctuations are larger in amplitude, L. natans is absent. Lake populations of this plant are strongly associated with soft-water conditions and low nutrient concentrations.|$|E
