Local services were franchised to Wales & West when the railway was privatised in 1997, which was in turn succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Powers.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the Great Wall {{in the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Wall, and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days.|$|E

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region.

5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700.
