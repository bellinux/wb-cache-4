Timothy Abernethie, his wife Maude, and Miss Gilchrist, who is now assisting them, come to Enderby. Poirot briefly poses as Monsieur Pontarlier but Rosamund uncovers his guise the first evening.

Before she can say more, she is savagely struck on the head.|$|E
500|$|When {{he turned}} 13, he {{discovered}} the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon [...] "Einstein fell in love" [...] with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly. He taught himself to play without [...] "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that [...] "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty." [...] At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played Beethoven's violin sonatas, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was [...] "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." [...] <b>What</b> <b>struck</b> the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein [...] "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however, were displeased {{with the}} film's long running time {{and lack of}} action scenes. [...] "The film gets mired in the {{inevitable}} red tape of police investigations," [...] wrote Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, who also felt that the film [...] "stumbles to a rather unfulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "seems to {{last as long as}} the Oscars." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer felt that [...] "Mr. Fincher's flair for casting is the major asset of his curiously attenuated return to the serial-killer genre. I keep saying 'curiously' with regard to Mr. Fincher, because I can't really figure out what he is up to in Zodiac – with its two-hour-and-37-minute running time for <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me as a shaggy-dog narrative." [...] Christy Lemire wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that [...] "Jake Gyllenhaal is both the central figure and the weakest link... But he's never fleshed out sufficiently to make you believe that he'd sacrifice his safety and that of his family to find the truth. We are told repeatedly that the former Eagle Scout is just a genuinely good guy, but that's not enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{these last}} twenty years, {{the work of}} C. G. Jung and of his disciple Erich Neumann have greatly enriched me. Their theory of [...] "self" [...] {{corresponds}} to my concept of essential being. For them the true self is {{the integration of the}} deep self with the existential one, which alone gives birth to the person. This is <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me: C.G.Jung has opened the way to initiation." ...|$|E
2500|$|I wasn’t so {{interested}} in macro, but <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [...] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious.... Bob and I had some long discussions, and I would say, “Well Bob, why is this the actual state space in this model?” [...] That question came up ... after I came to Penn. [...] At some point Karl [...] and I started talking about that and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots.|$|E
2500|$|Author James Baldwin was {{prevented}} from {{speaking at the}} March {{on the grounds that}} his comments would be too inflammatory. Baldwin later commented on the irony of the [...] "terrifying and profound" [...] requests that he prevent the March from happening: In my view, by that time, there was, on the one hand, nothing to prevent—the March had already been co-opted—and, on the other, no way of stopping the people from descending on Washington. <b>What</b> <b>struck</b> me most horribly was that virtually no one in power (including some blacks or Negroes who were somewhere next door to power) was able, even remotely, to accept the depth, the dimension, of the passion and the faith of the people.|$|E

Those are the factors that struck me immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, {{he also has a}} fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy.

2500|$|As a boy, Wojtyła was athletic, often playing {{football}} as goalkeeper. During his childhood, Wojtyła {{had contact with}} Wadowice's large Jewish community. School football games were often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and Wojtyła often played on the Jewish side. [...] "I remember that {{at least a third}} of my classmates at elementary school in Wadowice were Jews. At elementary school there were fewer. With some I was on very friendly terms. And <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me about some of them was their Polish patriotism." [...] It was around this time that the young Karol had his first serious relationship with a girl. He became close to a girl called Ginka Beer, described as [...] "a Jewish beauty, with stupendous eyes and jet black hair, slender, a superb actress." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the times, Rottalers were {{expected}} to be versatile enough to pull the plow during the week and the carriage to church on Sundays. Throughout the 19th century, Anglo-Norman, Cleveland bay and Oldenburg horses were imported to keep the Rottaler vibrant, and by 1906 the Rottaler Warmblood Horse Breeding Association was formed. In 1963, the breeding aim was redirected towards the production of more agile, sensitive riding horses, and the brand was changed from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "B". The Rottaler mares were bred to Hanoverians and Westphalians, and over successive generations, the breed threatened to disappear forever. It wasn't until 1991 that the Rottaler was re-established within the Bavarian association, and by that time there were scant few lines left. However, <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> the spectators at the first inspection of Rottaler mares in 1994 was the vitality of the mares, which had an average age of over 15.|$|E

2500|$|The studio did {{not like}} Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson [...] two of Stone's {{original}} choices. The director briefly considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me. The loneliness. I felt that was the quality that always marked Nixon." [...] When the actor met the director he {{got the impression that}} Stone was [...] "one of the great bad boys of American pop culture, and I might be a fool to walk away." [...] What convinced Hopkins to ultimately take on the role and [...] "impersonate the soul of Nixon were the scenes in the film when he talks about his mother and father. That affected me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen-year-old Stanley Williams was {{approached}} by Raymond Washington {{in the spring of}} 1971, at Washington Preparatory High School. Washington was from the East Side of South Central, while Williams was from the West Side of that area. A mutual friend of both young men informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs like the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang (both gangs would later become Bloods sets; The Brims and The Inglewood Family Bloods respectively). According to Williams' account of his initial meeting with Washington, <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, Washington and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique (leather jackets with starched Levi's jeans and suspenders). [...] Williams had befriended so many clique leaders and street thugs on the West Side, he and a few others formed what would become the West Side Crips.|$|E
2500|$|At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an {{off-road}} motorcyclist spotted what {{he initially}} described as [...] "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" [...] in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw. As he approached he realised {{that it was}} actually a corpse. In his subsequent testimony he explained: [...] "At first I thought it was a mannequin and <b>what</b> <b>struck</b> me was the leg, possibly the left leg. I could see bone there. Tailor's dummies don't have bones." [...] The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female. [...] He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which Detective Sergeant (DS) Clifford Neil of Strathclyde Police described as [...] "gruesome." [...] The body lay on a makeshift pyre and had heavy duty plastic sheet partly melted on to the facial area. Strathclyde Police launched a murder inquiry, led by Detective Superintendent (D/Supt) Derek Robertson of the force's Major Investigation Unit, on 24 May following the results of a post-mortem examination.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{would have}} liked to open {{the left side of the}} thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was {{slightly}} supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... <b>What</b> <b>struck</b> me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.".|$|E
2500|$|In 1923 he {{made his}} {{literary}} debut by publishing the mystery story [...] under the pen name [...] "Edogawa Ranpo" [...] (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like {{the name of the}} American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine Shin Seinen, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. Shin Seinen had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, {{but this was the first}} time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo's first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer, but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruikō Kuroiwa, Kidō Okamoto, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Haruo Satō, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque. <b>What</b> <b>struck</b> critics as new about Ranpo’s debut story [...] "The Two-Sen Copper Coin" [...] was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within a story that is closely related to Japanese culture. The story involves an extensive description of an ingenious code based on a Buddhist incantation known as the [...] "nenbutsu" [...] as well as Japanese-language Braille.|$|E
