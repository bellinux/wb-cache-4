5|$|Harmáček began {{creating}} his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he {{was working}} as an English teacher in Plzeň, Czech Republic, and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital transfers of a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings. Harmáček edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{the main}} {{armament}} in triple turrets {{was new to}} the Royal Navy though British companies {{had been involved in}} the production of triple gun turret designs for other navies. The choice of a high muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, the castle became {{increasingly}} unfashionable {{and fell into}} decline. By the mid-16th century, it was in ruins and unsuitable for royal use. Stone <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> castle to build houses and other buildings in the town. The castle was almost destroyed during {{the construction of the}} London and Birmingham Railway in the 1830s. As a result, it became the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from Parliament. In 1930, the castle passed from the Duchy of Cornwall to the government's control. It is maintained as a tourist attraction by English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 1832 and the {{introduction}} of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E

Ankarette's grandson Roger Twynyho received from Edward IV a full retrospective pardon for Ankarette, and the petition he submitted to the king in 1478 describes fully the circumstances of the case, well illustrating the quasi-kingly high-handedness of Clarence which was ultimately not tolerated by the king.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to {{the writing of the}} novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves.

5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts {{were replaced by}} a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E

For Blofeld's pseudonym in the novel, Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, Fleming uses the name of an old café he had seen in Hamburg in 1959 ("Old Shatterhand", a fictional character penned in a series of Western stories along with Winnetou by German writer Karl May) The characterisation of him dressed as a Samurai <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sketch Fleming had come up with thirty five years earlier for a character called Graf Schlick.|$|E
