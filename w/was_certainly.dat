5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; he <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' {{and in the}} thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parties of}} the College of Cardinals were of almost an equal size. The party of Aymeric had 19 members, while that of his opponents 24, but {{the party of the}} Chancellor <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> better organized.|$|E

5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|In the 1900s, Bolckow, Vaughan <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> {{the largest}} steel {{producer}} in Britain, {{and possibly the}} largest in the world. In 1905, the firm produced 820,000 tons of pig iron, which was 8.5% of Great Britain's output, and twice as much as the next largest producer. In 1907 {{it was one of the}} largest firms in Britain, with 20,000 employees.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> enjoying trading {{privileges}} under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were firmly established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, {{it was probably the}} largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Norman nobility {{gathered}} at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following {{the news that}} Stephen was gathering support in England. The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> preferable to Matilda.|$|E
5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, {{the book}} <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> at Kells in the 12th century, when land {{charters}} {{pertaining to the}} Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages. The practice of copying of charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period, and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time.|$|E
5|$|Romanus {{died before}} 627, {{probably}} about 625. He {{drowned in the}} Mediterranean Sea off Italy while {{on a mission to}} Rome for Justus. Presumably this happened before Justus' death in 627. He <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead by 633, when Paulinus of York became bishop at Rochester after fleeing Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours and Harrison lost 62 men (37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of the battle, with 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Native American casualties is still the subject of debate, but it <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> {{lower than that of}} the United States forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the church proper {{and the place}} of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortuary}} {{complex of}} Userkaf comprises the same structures {{as those of}} Userkaf's 4th dynasty predecessors: a high wall surrounded the complex with its pyramid and high temple and there <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> a valley temple located closer to the Nile, yet to be uncovered. The valley temple {{was connected to the}} pyramid by a causeway whose exact trajectory is unknown, even though its first few meters are still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Ag2r had {{a meager}} 2011 season, {{managing}} only six victories. The pinnacle of the team's season <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the Giro d'Italia. John Gadret, {{one of the}} team's leaders, won the undulating 11th stage to Castelfidardo. Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history. Hubert Dupont also rode very strongly in this race, to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well.|$|E

5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} {{have taken}} ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E
5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen it because it was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
