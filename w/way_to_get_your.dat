In these stages the bottom screen shows a cannon loaded with a Mini-Mario, a belt upon which the cannon moves on, and a button labeled Shoot that the player must tap to fire the Mini-Mario. The top screen shows your remaining hits, which depends on how many Mini-Marios the player led to the door throughout the entire floor, DK's remaining hits, which always starts out at six, DK's location, and objects the player needs to hit with a Mini-Mario in order to damage him. If a Mini-Mario collides with DK's side, that will damage him as well.

Once the player hits DK six times, the stage ends and the score is tallied up with 100 points for each second remaining and 1000 points for each surviving Mini-Mario.
