500|$|Before {{the series}} debuted on March 27, 2005, {{there were a}} few early {{releases}} to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: [...] "Ultimately <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that,</b> without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [...] build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] The show's title, Grey's Anatomy, was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's medical textbook, Gray's Anatomy, and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.|$|E

A new ownership group, led by former Rainmen advisor and CEO of Corporate Research Associates in Don Mills, soon confirmed that the defunct team's reincarnation would compete for the next season. Mills expected a group of 25 shareholders to help start up the organization, many of whom personally paid for the Rainmen's flights and hotels in the last season. He chose to not include Levingston in the ownership group but allowed him to assume the position as the team's general manager. Mills said, [...] "There {{would not be a}} new team in Halifax without Andre. <b>We</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the only way we would go forward to raise the money was if Andre was part of the solution."

Jesus People USA, a 500-member commune/business/charity/religious group with many members living in the ward, had supported Orbach throughout his career, but switched to Shiller before the run-off. Jesus People's spokesman explained [...] "We think Jerry Orbach is a lovely man, but he doesn't have what it takes to stand up to the development...If things keep going there will be massive displacement. People will be thrown out of their homes. <b>We</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Helen Shiller would do the most to prevent displacement." [...] Orbach supporters charged that a City official had offered City contracts to the Jesus People's construction firm if Shiller were elected. On Tuesday, April 7, 1987 Shiller defeated Orbach by 498 votes, 9,751 to 9,253, and contributed to a narrow, pro-Washington, reform-minded majority in the City Council which helped draw the Council Wars era to close.|$|E

[...] In the interview, Hossington said: [...] "I'm very keen to make it a big event!

[...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience.

Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it."
