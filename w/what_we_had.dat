Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> it in us, to accomplish.|$|E

Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, [...] "The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God's inaugural album. New American Gospel provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal's faith is maintained, effectively bridging the '90s' insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school's determined focus on riff construction." [...] Chris Adler commented: [...] "This is a classic record. We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career.

500|$|Jaded {{with their}} lifestyles in California {{and the various}} people frequenting the studios, the group moved the {{sessions}} to Caribbean Sound Basin in Maraval, a suburb of Port of Spain, Trinidad. The studio complex was one of Trinidad's few high-end recording locations and was founded in 1990 by Trinidadian businessman Robert Amar, who wanted to attract both local and international recording artists with a state-of-the-art facility and the area's culture. The group intended to use to the studio only to polish their previous sessions' output, but ended up writing and recording what became most of the album for two months. D'wayne Wiggins said of the move in an interview for Musician, [...] "the record company really wanted to put <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> out, but we ourselves didn't feel like the album was done." ...|$|E

We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also {{the ability to create}} another world and create longform characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course ...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them {{because of the nature of}} long-form and their development of character and plot." [...] He went on to praise network HBO by saying, [...] "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [...] brilliantly put together...
