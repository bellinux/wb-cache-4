5|$|An {{earthquake}} {{opens up}} a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave {{near the village of}} Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E
5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even {{expected him to be}} replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} very clear that the Companions did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra {{into her}} home, {{in a big}} city that resembles a retrofuturistic London, and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She does not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E

500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove calls its mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E

Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious.

500|$|Chapman Flack, in {{reviewing}} a training video by Rosenberg, finds {{the presentation of}} key ideas [...] "spell-binding" [...] and the anecdotes [...] "humbling and inspiring", notes the [...] "beauty of his work", and his [...] "adroitly doing fine attentive thinking" [...] when interacting with his audience. Yet Flack wonders <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of aspects of Rosenberg's presentation, such as his apparent [...] "dim view of the place for thinking" [...] and his building on Walter Wink's account {{of the origins of}} our way of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature history, literature and art offer.|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, {{published}} together posthumously in December 1817, {{were reviewed}} in the British Critic in March 1818 {{and in the}} Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany in May 1818. The reviewer for the British Critic felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the Edinburgh Review disagreed, praising Austen for her [...] "exhaustless invention" [...] and {{the combination of the}} familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.|$|E

500|$|His second album, Barcelona, {{recorded}} with Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé, combines elements {{of popular music}} and opera. Many critics were uncertain <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the album; one {{referred to it as}} [...] "the most bizarre CD of the year". The album was a commercial success, and the album's title track debuted at No.8 in the UK and was also a hit in Spain. The title track received massive air play as the official anthem of the 1992 Summer Olympics (held in Barcelona one year after Mercury's death). Caballé sang it live {{at the opening of the}} Olympics with Mercury's part played on a screen, and again prior to the start of the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich in Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times later {{described}} Yesterday's Wine as [...] "the {{last and}} best of [...] Nashville albums", {{saying that it was}} [...] "Organized in the manner of an epic poem, each cut a metaphor in the journey through life... it was Nashville's first fully conceived concept album, and nobody knew <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. It soon disappeared quietly and utterly." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] " [...] is the first of his bold, conceptual departures from country's hits-plus-filler norm. Rather than tack rock guitar riffs onto modern honky-tonk sagas, Nelson absorbed the innovations of Bob Dylan and the singer-songwriters into his own distinct style. Even if the narrative concepts don't always hold together, Willie hangs his most ambitious albums on some of his catchiest tunes." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson {{referred}} to audiences' Friday night plans away from television when he commented the episode was [...] "better than any movie you're {{going to see}} in the theater right now". Hanson thought the mystery produced [...] "surprises around every corner". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining he enjoyed the [...] "classic Fringe" [...] opening scene, the [...] "decent [...] job" [...] by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was [...] "very clever [...] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks". Isler wasn't sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that [...] "this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history".|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E
