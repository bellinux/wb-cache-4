40|$|Single-layered <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were {{produced}} by the 60 D/ 36 F (containing 36 filaments) polyester yarn with differential shrinkage (DS) property in this study. Due to the differential shrinkage property, the fabric becomes curly and bulkier, simulating cotton fabric {{in terms of its}} appearance and fabric handle. The performance and appearance of these DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric. Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment. Besides, the fabric handle was evaluated by Kawabata evaluation system and subject to trial under dry and wet fabric condition. DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics provide better recovery under low stress mechanical pressure. The subjective evaluation result shows that the <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics made of DS polyester had similar handle against cotton <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric in terms of prickle, smooth, comfort and dry feeling in both dry and wet testing conditions...|$|R

Fabric hand value reflects the subjective physiological and psychological perception of human by touching the materials and has direct influence on the sell market of textiles and garments. Such importance makes fabric hand as an attractive issue to many researchers and its continuity has not been ceased. This thesis is thus written for further study on fabric hand attributes, especially for <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics. A sample size including 105 types of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics produced by synthetic fibers (polyester, polypropylene and nylon) were selected as the research object. Traditional subjective evaluation and two objective measurements Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F) and PhabrOmeter system were employed to obtain the fabric hand properties related with stiffness, smoothness and softness. Correlations between physical parameters like {{weight per unit area}} and thickness and different types of mechanical parameters such as bending rigidity, extensibility, compression and surface roughness were also observed. Further attempts had been made to calculate the linear significance of fabric hand values drawn out by those measurement methods. Statistical interpretations were used to descant the relationships of fabric parameters and hand characteristics. Specifications of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics showed significance on fabric tensile, shear, bending and compression properties.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{construction}} of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics upon their bursting strengths and absorbability are the subject of this paper. 	The following results have been obtained from our experiments. 	(1) The bursting strengths of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics made of same material are subject to the densities of fabrics and the toughness of underlap yarns. As the differences of underlap lengths are very little among <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics with same weave and various densities, the bursting strengths of such fabrics are mostly determined by their densities. As the density of the fabric is increased, the bursting strength is greatly increased within certain limits of smaller density, and then with the gradually diminishing rate of increase. But the bursting strength does not noticcably increase beyond a certain limit of density. 	(2) The bursting strengths of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics with same density and various weaves are determined by their underlap lengths and the numbers of the crossing of underlap with loop. The bursting strengths of the same density fabrics are increased with the underlap length of the fabric. 	(3) The absorbability of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics made of same material is determined by the porosity of yarn itself and the inclined porosity between each crossing yarn in unit areas of the fabrics. In case of fabrics knitted with same density, both the total amount of water absorbed (a) and the rate of absorption of water (b) are increased with the increase of the density of the fabric. 	(4) Among same density fabrics, the values of (a) and (b) of the fabric are increased as the underlap length is increased, the increase being especially great in the value of (b) in course direction.
