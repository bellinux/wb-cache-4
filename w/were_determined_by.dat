5|$|Unlike other WWE pay-per-views, where stipulations <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> WWE's {{creative}} staff, {{this was}} the second event where stipulations for matches <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's official website. The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches. Although the stipulations resulted from votes by WWE fans, different wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines, which led to scheduled matches in which WWE fans could vote upon stipulations.|$|E
5|$|Battleships {{played a}} part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as {{independent}} commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the stage's type. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage four. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
30|$|Eight {{chemical}} properties of each sample, including pH, organic matter (OM), potassium (K), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), and arsenic (As) <b>were</b> <b>determined.</b> The pH {{of the soil}} sample <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> using a digital pH meter. Organic matter (OM) <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> following potassium chromate method for determination of soil organic matter (NY/T 1121.6 2006; Rahman et al. 2017). Potassium (K) of the soil samples <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> Potassium Strip Test (Rahman et al. 2017).

5|$|Although the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual {{capacity}} of almost 85,000 spectators, that {{was reduced to}} 69,500 for the final. Of those tickets, approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase {{by the general public}} via the UEFA website. Recipients of those tickets <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. Tickets were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on their location in the stadium. UEFA received around 125,000 applications for tickets from the general public {{over the course of the}} three-week application process.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Öhlund was {{selected}} to play in three World Junior Championships for Sweden. Beginning in 1994, he contributed two assists in seven games {{as part of a}} silver medal effort. As the medals <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a round-robin format, Sweden fell one point short of Canada, losing 6–4 to them in their final and deciding game. After a bronze medal in 1995, Öhlund returned for a third straight World Junior tournament in 1996 to record five assists and was named the tournament's Best Defenceman. He was additionally named to the Tournament All-Star Team as he captured his second World Junior silver medal.|$|E

5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> X-ray diffraction.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 college {{football}} season, teams {{were selected for}} the Sugar Bowl under the new Bowl Alliance system. The Bowl Alliance matched up the conference champions of the Big East, Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and two at-large teams in games to determine an official national champion. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the Bowl Alliance and its predecessor, the Bowl Coalition, national champions <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> various {{college football}} polls that sometimes named different teams as champion.|$|E
5|$|NWA/WCW United States Tag Team Championship reigns <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> {{professional}} wrestling matches, {{in which}} competitors {{are involved in}} scripted rivalries. These narratives create feuds between the various competitors, which cast them as villains and heroes. Overall, there were 19 reigns among 15 tag teams, all of which occurred in the United States. From the information known, The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane)'s first reign was the longest in the title's history at 346 days, while The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers)' second reign was the shortest, at 19 days. The Midnight Express also held the most reigns overall as a tag team and individually, with three.|$|E

5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the wishes of the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax {{on the price of}} slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, {{construed}} as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the census, which required each head of household {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E

5|$|The rates <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the Council of the European Union, {{based on}} a {{recommendation}} from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the stage's type. The flat stage finishes awarded a maximum of 45 points, the medium mountain stages awarded a maximum of 30 points, and the high mountain stages, time trials and intermediate sprints awarded a maximum of 20 points. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin {{outlined a}} hypothesis of transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E
