However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream.

5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a <b>water</b> <b>phase,</b> prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The {{position}} of the Gulf Stream influences waterbird brood numbers in a Mediterranean wetland (Albuferas de Adra, Spain) Wetlands constitute complex ecosystems where different stable states alternate through catastrophic regime shifts. It is known that the inter-annual variation in the spring weather conditions constitutes a key factor for catastrophic shifts between phytoplankton-dominated turbid states and clear <b>water</b> <b>phases</b> in Albuferas de Adra, a Mediterranean coastal wetland. In previous studies we demonstrated that this alternation of equilibrium states {{has an effect on}} waterbirds, which show higher abundance and brood production in years characterised by the occurrence of clear <b>water</b> <b>phases.</b> In this paper we examine the teleconnection between the Gulf Stream position, a large-scale oscillating phenomena influencing weather conditions in West Europe, the weather variability in Albuferas de Adra and waterbird brood numbers in such an ecosystem. Our results suggest that when the Gulf Stream moves towards the south unstable meteorological conditions prevail in the region, favouring the productivity of waterbirds within the wetland through the occurrence of clear <b>water</b> <b>phases.</b> By contrast, northern displacements of the oceanic current are associated with stable weather, turbid <b>water</b> <b>phases</b> and lower numbers of broods.

For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which is stable {{at room temperature}} because it reaches phase equilibrium. At freezing temperatures, the structures inside mayonnaise undergo crystallization {{depending on the type}} of emulsion. Unlike mayonnaise, butter is a water-in-oil emulsion with the <b>water</b> <b>phase</b> having a higher freezing point than oil. When frozen, the small water droplets suspended in the continuous oil phase freeze where they are, while the rest of the oil stays in place. On thawing the butter, it regains its properties as the water droplets melt in their original locations.|$|E
25|$|Using these data, he {{quantified}} radical {{loss from}} particles, showing that simple diffusion theory {{could explain the}} results. Gilbert and his coworkers then revealed the mechanism for initiation in emulsion polymerisation by the entry of radicals into particles—in terms of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic precepts—in a theory that clarifies the process as being through production of surface-active species in the <b>water</b> <b>phase.</b> This model produced various qualitative predictions. One prediction, that of {{the independence of the}} entry-rate coefficient of the size and surface properties of particles, was widely seen as counterintuitive because of the deep-rooted belief in models that he had shown to be wrong. Subsequently, this prediction was experimentally verified by Gilbert and others. He used the understanding from this knowledge to develop a priori models for particle formation and molecular-weight distribution.|$|E

25|$|When {{hydrocarbon}} molecules (oil) {{are forced}} into water layer, hydrogen bond of water molecules and some dispersion forces between hydrocarbon molecules {{must have been}} destroyed, and new water-hydrocarbon interaction must have been formed in this state. Considering enthalpy change of the process, the input energy to reach this state and the released energy break even rendering enthalpy change of zero (ΔHsolution =0) for the process. Enthalpy change equals zero also means that the thermal entropy change ΔSthermal is also about zero for the process. However, positional entropy change for the process (ΔSpositional) is negative. This is because when oil droplets are in water medium, those water molecules that are {{in contact with the}} hydrocarbon molecules lose their freedom of movement. If oil droplets are not in <b>water</b> <b>phase,</b> more water molecules would be more freely to move instead of having restriction on their arrangements. Thus, it is a thermodynamically favorable process for the pure, unprotected oil droplets to move out of water medium as the process is driven forward by entropy.|$|E

2500|$|In oil-in-water {{emulsions}} such as mayonnaise, {{however, the}} continuous <b>water</b> <b>phase</b> freezes, allowing the oil droplets to flocculate. This process causes a phase {{separation between the}} water and the oil. Once ice crystals start to form in the continuous <b>water</b> <b>phase,</b> they begin to inhibit the lecithin and phospholipids from working. These two emulsifying agents lose their functionality due to dehydration: water is crystallizing out, leaving these agents [...] "out to dry." [...] The oil droplets begin to flocculate without the emulsifying agents keeping them separated. At the freezing point of water, this is enough to destabilize the mayonnaise emulsion; at even lower temperatures the fused oil droplets reach their freezing points and fat crystal nucleation begins. These processes make mayonnaise degrade when frozen and thawed; freezing is not a suitable way to store it.|$|E

2500|$|Phase {{separation}} {{of oil and}} water is not only entropy-driven, but is also driven forward to undo the increase in contact area between oil and water. Forming extra interfacial layer, as when oil droplets are in the water layer, increase the overall energy of the oil-water system. This is because water and oil molecules at the interface are higher in energy compared to {{when they are in}} the middle and are surrounded on all directions by their own molecules. Thus, oil droplets would move out of <b>water</b> <b>phase,</b> after letting the mixture sit for a little, to get the change in interfacial area (ΔA) as small as possible in order to minimize the energy rise of the system (ΔG).

Numerical experiments {{were used to}} calculate the potential of mean force between the host and guest at different separation distances. The thermodynamic properties of association are obtained by integrating the free-energy profile. In this study, we specially focus on the comparison of the association process between β-CD and FcOH in both isolated and <b>water</b> <b>phases.</b> We establish that the association process is enthalpy driven in all conditions (homogeneous and heterogeneous systems in both isolated and <b>water</b> <b>phases).</b> As a consequence, the driving forces involved in the complexation by β-CD are then essentially due to van der Waals interactions. As concerns the comparison between the isolated and <b>water</b> <b>phases,</b> the simulations have shown that the association constants in vacuum are significantly greater than the corresponding ones in solution. A significant difference appears in the enthalpy between the two conditions.
