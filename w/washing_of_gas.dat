40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) model of a counter-current Open Spray Tower desulphurisation reactor and its application in the simulation of a full-scale industrial equipment. The raw flue gas flows upward while a suspension of water and limestone is sprayed downward from different heights. Thereby sulfur dioxide is <b>washed</b> out <b>of</b> the <b>gas.</b> The two-phase gas–liquid flow inside the equipment has been simulated with an Euler–Lagrange approach using a commercial CFD code, while {{a model for the}} SO 2 absorption has been developed and implemented in the software through dedicated modules. Physical absorption is modeled using dual-film theory and appropriate empirical and semi-empirical correlations. The aqueous phase chemistry accounts for the instantaneous equilibrium reactions of eight dissolved species into a slurry droplet. The model is used to simulate an industrial plant at different operating conditions. The numerical results are in good agreement with the measured values of pressure drop and sulphur removal efficiency...|$|R
