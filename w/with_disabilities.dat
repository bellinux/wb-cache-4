40|$|In {{this study}} we examine to what extent people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> {{participate}} in television news {{and how they are}} represented. We chose to examine one broadcast per day of SVT Public Service news program Rapport and commercial channel TV 4 Nyheterna (TV 4 News) during one month using quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis. We found that people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are underrepresented in television news. In Rapport only 1, 9 percent of the total broadcasting time contained people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and in TV 4 Nyheterna 3 percent of the total broadcasting time contained people <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> In the news people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> were often represented as stereotypes, most commonly as victims. The focus was often on the medical aspect of the disability and on the problems that people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> had. Through our qualitative analysis we found that television news discriminated people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in almost all of the news features by representing them as passive and not individuals but as representatives of the group “people with disability”...|$|R

As for the study method, literature review was employed to analyze the literatures and information related to financial resources of employment policy for persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> mainly focusing on the revenue account among the accounts of budget to implement the employment policy for person <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The biggest difference between financial resources to perform the employment policy for persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> of Japan and South Korea is from the total amount of budget and the distribution ratio of General Account, Social Insurance and the share. While in Japan the employment policies for persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are financed by the General Account and Social Insurance much more than the Share, in South Korea, they are financed by the Share more than the General Account and Employment Insurance.
