Most of New Guinea {{consisted of}} mountains and jungle, {{with very few}} airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied <b>Works</b> <b>Council.</b> Casey attempted to coordinate {{the activities of the}} various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{institutional}} challenges German <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> face currently. These challenges consist of structural economic change from industrial to service sectors {{accompanied by an}} extension of 'co-determination-free-zones', an enhanced labour force diversity beyond {{the image of the}} male blue collar worker as the 'normal employee' <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> represent, the transformation of companies into network companies splitting up established <b>works</b> <b>councils,</b> co-management in times of competitive restructuring of firms and the emergence of new postfordistic production models with ambivalent impacts on working conditions. Moreover, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are challenged by a partial decentralisation of collective bargaining towards the establishment level dissolving the established division of labour between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and trade unions. These new challenges confront <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> with risks of structural overcharge endangering their institutional stability. Institutional learning may increase the institutional capabilities and competences required to <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in order to meet new challenges. It could focus on a critical reflection of established practises in interest representation, utilising workforce diversity as a social resource of interest representation and promote co-operation between <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in network companies or multinationals. However, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are not capable of meeting new challenges self-destined, rather they still depend on a supportive infrastructure of advice and consultancy provided by trade unions. In order to offer support tailored to the needs of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and to overcome their crisis in respect to social legitimacy trade unions will as well have to undergo processes of institutional learning to enhance their regional capacities of action, to promote innovative ideas or social issues and to utilise the increased workforce diversity as a starting point to attract new target groups of potential union members. The recognition of workforce diversity proves to be a significant prerequisite to draw on diversity as a social resource of institutional learning by <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and unions.

However, <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are generally not allowed to bargain over issues already dealt with in {{collective bargaining}} agreements, such as wages and vacation entitlements. In addition to <b>works</b> <b>councils,</b> there are so-called personnel councils, which cover most public sector employees.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in a simple agency {{framework}} in which <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are supposed to monitor manager’s information {{on behalf of the}} workforce, but they are independent agents who might pursue their private interest. First, we consider that workers can incentivize <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> through contingent monetary payments. In order to deter collusion, workers must pay higher compensations in states of nature where they can be expropriated by potential coalitions among <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and management. Collusion makes contingent payments costly and reduces workers’ payoffs. Second, when elections are the exclusive mechanisms to align works councils’ interest, only well compensated representatives would face an intertemporal tradeoff between accepting management’s transfers at first period and losing rents at the second period. Elections increase the cost of entering on collusive behavior with management and <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> will try to behave on the employees’ interest...|$|R

In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights {{on issues such as}} working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and short-time work.

Although this was illegal, the union workers agreed, and elections were organized. Although Fred Lip had believed this would allow him more control of the workers, in less than a year all the young representatives joined the CFTC. Fred Lip then submitted a proposal to the inspection du travail (government labor inspection office) which would eliminate all of the sector of the company to which most of the union workers belonged, including Charles Piaget. However, he offered Piaget a promotion, naming him head of the workshop. For the next year, the workers blocked attempts to eliminate the department, opposing those who tried to move the machines out of the factory.|$|E

2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} {{not enabled}} to legislate on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's previous case law, notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European <b>Works</b> <b>Council</b> Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E
