6000|$|There {{needs no}} better rallying-ground for {{international}} amity, than that furnished by an eminent English writer: [...] "There is," [...] say she, [...] "a sacred bond between us {{of blood and}} of language, which no circumstances can break. Our literature must always be theirs; and though their laws {{are no longer the}} same as ours, we have the same Bible, and <b>we</b> <b>address</b> our common Father in the same prayer.

60|$|Proceeding, therefore, as we {{are obliged}} to proceed,--that is, upon an {{hypothesis}} that <b>we</b> <b>address</b> rational men,--can false political principles be more effectually exposed than by demonstrating that they lead to consequences directly inconsistent with and subversive of the arrangements grounded upon them? If this kind of demonstration is not permitted, the process of reasoning called deductio ad absurdum, which even the severity of geometry does not reject, could not be employed at all in legislative discussions. One of our strongest weapons against folly acting with authority would be lost.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} <b>we</b> <b>addressed</b> the {{strategies}} that normal human subjects employ t o make rapid interceptive movements. In {{the planning and}} continuous control of such movements, sensory information of very different modalities has to be integrated rapidly and accurately, {{and has to be}} translated into useful movements of the hand. <b>We</b> <b>addressed</b> the problem both with and without a model. With the mass-spring model we wanted to test whether such a model gives a valid description for both manipulations of the equilibrium point and of the endpoint (chapters 2, 6 and 7; cf. Fig. 1. 1). In using a mass-spring model, we supposed that subjects used one single strategy for the sensory-motor control throughout an experiment (stable control). In chapter 5 we tested the validity of this assumption of stable control. Finally <b>we</b> specifically <b>addressed</b> the question whether –and if so, how– people use velocity information (rather than only position information) to guide their action (chapters 3, 4 and 6) ...|$|R
