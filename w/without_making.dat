In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible <b>without</b> <b>making</b> compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia <b>without</b> <b>making</b> the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E

5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount.

5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League <b>without</b> <b>making</b> any impact {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for the future.|$|E

Jeanne turned to the west on November 11, and it rapidly intensified to its peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h). It weakened on November 12, and its forward motion slowed; the cyclone weakened further to a tropical storm because of dry air intrusion, and it executed a clockwise loop on November 15. It dissipated on November 16.|$|E
5|$|In May 1805 a large French fleet {{under the}} command of Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve escaped from Toulon. Bellerophon was {{dispatched}} with a squadron under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood to patrol the Straits of Gibraltar. Before they could arrive, Villeneuve had collected Spanish reinforcements under Admiral Federico Gravina, and had sailed into the Atlantic, pursued by Nelson's Mediterranean Fleet. While Nelson chased Villeneuve around the West Indies <b>without</b> <b>making</b> contact, Collingwood mounted a blockade of Cadiz. His squadron was still there in mid-August when Villeneuve appeared off the port with his fleet. Possessing too few ships to intercept the combined fleet, Collingwood allowed them to enter Cadiz, and then remounted the blockade. He was reinforced with a number of ships over the next few months, with Nelson taking over command on 28 September.|$|E
