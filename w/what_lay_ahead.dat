At this time the Japanese had established a beachhead on the north coast of New Guinea. It was clear to Potts that the 21st would soon be fighting in the jungle. He devised and implemented the first specific jungle training for Australian troops. Potts took his troops up into the Blackall Range, where the thick scrub and steep grades gave these experienced desert fighters an idea of <b>what</b> <b>lay</b> <b>ahead</b> for them. War game exercises indicated that in such country communications would break down, and evacuation of wounded would be difficult.|$|E
25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of <b>what</b> <b>lay</b> <b>ahead.</b> The tram operator urged the chopper {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E

500|$|This {{failure was}} an {{important}} factor when Mortier lost his corps' so-called [...] "eyes": after he and Gazan had crossed the Danube, the French dragoons had veered to the northwest, leaving only three squadrons of the 4th Dragoons available for reconnaissance.

Consequently, Mortier and Gazan marched blindly through the narrow canyon west of Dürenstein, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>lay</b> <b>ahead</b> of them. Kutuzov had led the Coalition army across the Danube at Krems, a short distance past Stein, and destroyed the bridge behind him. His actions deprived the France commanders of a possible route across the Danube, putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk {{in the case of}} retreat. In this decision Kutuzov abandoned Vienna to the French, who were converging on the Austrian capital from the north, west and southwest, for the security of uniting with reinforcements from Galicia.

40|$|Understanding HIV drug {{resistance}} {{has played a}} key role in the success of antiretroviral therapy. This knowledge allowed for the prediction of resistance evolution when a specific drug or combinations of drugs were administered, informing strategies implemented for initial and subsequent drug regimens. Resistance testing of individual patients detects transmitted as well as acquired {{drug resistance}} as a result of treatment failure, leading to improved treatment choices in drug naïve and drug experienced patients accordingly. The last two decades has seen a great deal of evolution, improvement and change in the care of HIV-positive individuals. Much of this was aimed at preventing, reducing or minimizing the impact of HIV drug resistance. Drugs with much improved resistance characteristics were designed and gained widespread use, as well as those with superior pharmacology and toxicity profiles assisting in better adherence and far reduced failure rates. Patient management strategies and monitoring technologies were refined, and education of clinicians and patients on optimal aspects of care routinely was implemented. All these have led to a new world of HIV clinical care and require a rethinking of how best to use our knowledge of resistance and when, how and in whom to test for it. <b>What</b> <b>lays</b> <b>ahead</b> for HIV drug resistance in the near and distant future, and is it time to teach old dogs new tricks...|$|R

Now, at a Red Cross Shelter in Ohio, she slowly strings a racket as she tells a volunteer about her past, Pittsburgh 2 ̆ 7 s past, and <b>what</b> might <b>lay</b> <b>ahead</b> for both.

40|$|Honouring {{the dead}} is a {{universal}} principle that has been evidenced {{since the dawn of}} time. Although burial of the dead has not been experienced universally, ritual burial practices have been widespread throughout millennia and it is through examination of burial sites that insight is gained into the manner in which tribute was paid to the dead. When humans became self-aware, understanding that there was a transition between life and the known world, to death and the unknown, those cultures that practiced burial rituals ensured that the dead were well equipped for <b>what</b> may <b>lay</b> <b>ahead.</b> This paper discusses textile and other surface embellishments found on Native American artefacts. Emphasizing the widespread practice of burying the dead with decorated garments and headdresses for power, magic, and ritual purposes, reference is made to the Californian West Coast Chumash peoples to describe symbolic embellishments found in a Chumash burial site, as well as the Adena peoples whose elaborate burial cult rituals became widespread throughout the Midwestern and Eastern Native Americas through extensive trade and cultural assimilation. Evidential artefacts from the Augustine Burial Mound in Miramichi, New Brunswick shows a strong link with the Adena and illustrates how widespread the Adena (and later Hopewell) burial cult became. Photographs of grave goods magnify the textile materials found within the Augustine Mound and these are compared and contrasted with other artefacts from an historical perspective, the ceremonial and ritual context in which these artefacts may have been created as forms of empowerment and symbolism, and the religious, political and ethical constructs within the selected Native American cultural experiences. The existence of chiefdoms and stratified social systems is evidenced in prehistoric textiles associated with mummies and burial mounds, through examination of fibre characteristics, dyes, surface embellishments, and style. Burial mound textiles throughout the Americas hold decorative elements that include animal hair, metals, shells, bone, and precious and semiprecious stones to adorn clothing and headdresses, and these embellishments were intended to communicate messages of ritual, magic, and power...|$|R
