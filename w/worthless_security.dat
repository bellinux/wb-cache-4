5000|$|Stock Bashing: [...] "This {{scheme is}} usually orchestrated by savvy online message board posters (a.k.a. [...] "Bashers") {{who make up}} false and/or {{misleading}} information about the target company {{in an attempt to}} get shares for a cheaper price. This activity, in most cases, is conducted by posting libelous posts on multiple public forums. The perpetrators sometimes work directly for unscrupulous Investor Relations firms who have convertible notes that convert for more shares the lower the bid or ask price is; thus the lower these Bashers can drive a stock price down by trying to convince shareholders they have bought a <b>worthless</b> <b>security,</b> the more shares the Investor Relations firm receives as compensation. Immediately after the stock conversion is complete and shares are issued to the Investor Relations firm, consultant, attorney or similar party, the basher/s then become friends of the company and move quickly to ensure they profit on a classic Pump & Dump scheme to liquidate their ill gotten shares.

40|$|In Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Commissioner, the Fifth Circuit {{reversed}} the Tax Court and {{held that the}} taxpayer was entitled to an ordinary loss deduction from its abandonment of securities. While the conclusion reached by the Fifth Circuit has been overshadowed by the promulgation of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) that effectively treats an abandoned security as worthless and thus characterizes the loss as capital, the case remains noteworthy because it provides an opportunity to examine the statutory interpretation of two distinct Internal Revenue Code sections, section 165 (g) (1) and section 1234 A. The article focuses on what methods of statutory construction should have been utilized to determine the application of these sections to the Pilgrim’s Pride fact-pattern. Ordinary loss treatment for an abandoned security seems conceptually incorrect when both a <b>worthless</b> <b>security</b> and a sale of the security for a de minimis amount would generally result in a capital loss. The article analyzes whether, and if so, under what theory did the courts deciding Pilgrim’s Pride possess the statutory authority to treat the abandonment as a capital loss. Furthermore, assuming the courts had such authority, the article considers whether it was proper to do so under the particular factual circumstances surrounding this case. There {{are a variety of}} statutory construction methodologies each with erudite proponents making very persuasive contentions. Applying an Internal Revenue Code section to a particular fact-pattern, however, it can often be wiser not to be wedded to one approach, e. g., textualism. Instead, it is submitted that employing disparate methodologies depending on the particular circumstances may be sounder. Pilgrim’s Pride provides a focal point for examining statutory interpretation methodologies and illustrating the foregoing. As such, reflecting on the case has continuing relevance despite the widespread application of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) to the abandonment of securities. As demonstrated by the different approaches that I believe were proper here for considering the applicability of sections 165 (g) (1) and 1234 A to Pilgrim’s Pride, distinct circumstances require discrete approaches to applying a statutory provision to a case. Our democratic institutions are not put at risk, by foregoing dogmatic textualism where this would lead to a result wherein “no conceivable tax policy... supports this interpretation” or deeming, in the case of section 165 (g) (1), an abandoned security to be per se worthless. Restraint, however, from deviating from the clear language of the text, such as applying section 1234 A to inherent rights, may be in order where there are no overriding reasons not to do so...|$|E
5000|$|Distressed {{securities}} are securities over {{companies or}} government entities that are experiencing financial or operational distress, default, or are under bankruptcy. As far as debt securities, {{this is called}} distressed debt. Purchasing or holding such distressed-debt creates significant risk due {{to the possibility that}} bankruptcy may render such <b>securities</b> <b>worthless</b> (zero recovery).|$|R
500|$|In Taylor's {{final year}} in the NFL, he started a company called All-Pro Products. The company went public at $5 a share, and tripled in value during its first month. The stock price reached $16.50 a share, at which point Taylor's stake had an {{estimated}} value of over $10 million. The company ceased production shortly thereafter however, and Taylor, who never sold his stock, lost several hundred thousand dollars. He had been defrauded by {{several members of the}} penny stock firm Hanover Sterling & Company, who had short sold the company's stock, making it <b>worthless.</b> The <b>Securities</b> and Exchange Commission ruled that two traders had manipulated the price of the stock, which skyrocketed while the company was losing over $900,000. Taylor has also had self-inflicted financial problems; in 1997 he pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in 1990, and in 2000 he was [...] "sentenced to three months of house arrest, five years of probation, and 500 hours of community service for tax evasion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{narrative}} {{focuses on}} {{high levels of}} private debt in the US economy. USA household debt {{as a percentage of}} annual disposable personal income was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990. Faced with increasing mortgage payments as their adjustable rate mortgage payments increased, households began to default in record numbers, rendering mortgage-backed <b>securities</b> <b>worthless.</b> High private debt levels also impact growth by making recessions deeper and the following recovery weaker. Robert Reich claims the amount of debt in the US economy can be traced to economic inequality, assuming that middle-class wages remained stagnant while wealth concentrated at the top, and households [...] "pull equity from their homes and overload on debt to maintain living standards." ...|$|R
