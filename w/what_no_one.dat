5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E
25|$|According to biographer Juhani Suomi, Kekkonen gave {{no thought}} to resigning until his {{physical}} condition began to deteriorate in July 1981. The 80-year-old president {{then began to}} seriously consider resigning, most likely in early 1982. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto finally dealt a defeat to Kekkonen in 1981. In April, Koivisto did <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else had dared to during Kekkonen's presidency by stating that under the constitution, {{the prime minister and}} cabinet were responsible to Parliament, not to the President. He then refused to resign at Kekkonen's request. This is generally seen as the death-knell of the Kekkonen era.|$|E
500|$|<b>What</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could foresee {{was that}} PedroII and Teresa Cristina {{would have no}} more children.

2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you say to them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to themâ€”I would listen to what they have to say, and that's <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> did." ...|$|E

In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled [...] "Redeemer", which was released on his [...] to Queen of the Damned.

2500|$|In 2008, Dearboy {{admitted}} {{to being a}} member of Charles Taylor's defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia rebel movement. During the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) public hearings, Dearboy said he was forcefully enlisted into the NPFL, in 1992, while searching for his girlfriend in Grand Bassa County. Three witnesses said that Dearboy raped a young woman and murdered several men, women, and children in Grand Bassa County during the civil war. Dearboy denied the accusation leveled against him. Dearboy expressed penitence {{for his role in the}} rebel movement, saying: [...] "The past is <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is in control of. No one is reading my mind except God. But I want to say if I hurt anyone during the war, I am sorry, very, very sorry from the depth of my heart. I am sorry for whatever role I played during the revolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally the Crimean war {{at the end}} of {{his reign}} {{demonstrated}} to the world <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had previously realized: Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward, and administratively incompetent. [...] Despite his grand ambitions toward the south and Ottoman Empire, Russia had not built its railroad network in that direction, and communications were bad. [...] The bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war. [...] The Navy was weak and technologically backward; the Army, although very large, was good only for parades, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, poor morale, and was even more out of touch with the latest technology as developed by Britain and France. As Fuller notes, [...] "Russia had been beaten on the Crimean peninsula, and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Model Bs {{received}} by Chennault and assembled in Burma {{at the end}} of 1941 were not well liked. There were no auxiliary fuel tanks that could be dropped before going into combat, and there were no bomb racks on the wings. [...] Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant tank would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. [...] The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile radio transceiver, RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. [...] Because the plane lacked a supercharger, its effective ceiling was about 25,000 feet. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source of spare parts was damaged aircraft. The planes were thought to be <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the plane had advantages: its gas tanks were self-sealing and could take hits without catching fire. There were two heavy sheets of steel behind the pilot's head and back. The plane as a whole was ruggedly constructed.|$|E
2500|$|Frontman Kurt Cobain {{was found}} dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana {{subsequently}} disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists; press rumors indicated he might be joining Pearl Jam and he almost accepted a permanent position as drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record fifteen of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on [...] "X-Static", played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Dave Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. [...] "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," [...] Grohl later said. [...] "I thought that I would rather do <b>what</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me." [...] Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.|$|E
