30|$|A novel {{successive}} multistep growth {{method was}} developed to synthesize very long ZnS nanowires of several hundred µm in length. A systematic study was carried out to determine the optimal parameters affecting {{the dimensions of the}} nanowires synthesized on a large scale. Ultra-long ZnS nanowires were grown successfully through thermal evaporation of zinc and sulfur powder at 600 – 800 and 140  °C, respectively. The ZnS nanowires were grown with a mixture of zinc blend and <b>wurtzite</b> <b>structures.</b> In VLS deposition, adjusting the synthesis conditions controls the formation of ZnS nanostructures as nanoflowers, nanowires and nanorods. Increasing the substrate temperature from 600 to 800  °C increases the nanowire diameter and decreases their length. The abundance of <b>wurtzite</b> <b>structures</b> in the mixture increased as the substrate temperature increased. XRD data analysis [as per the ratio of (100)–(002) peaks at different substrate temperatures] confirms that a cubic to hexagonal phase transformation has taken place at a lower temperature than that for bulk ZnS.|$|R

In Zn 1 −xCdxO, Cd has an orbital component as large as that of Zn {{at the bottom of the}} conduction band. On the other hand, the contribution of Mg is much smaller in Zn 1 −xMgxO.
