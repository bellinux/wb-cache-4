500|$|Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{reviewed}} Fallout: New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively, {{despite its}} many crash bugs and glitches. Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much.

Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E
