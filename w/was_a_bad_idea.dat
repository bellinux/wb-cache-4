5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main {{reason was that}} labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established {{that no one was}} exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E

25|$|In {{the weeks}} before Bound for Glory, Kip James again {{came to the rescue}} of B.G. James in {{situations}} with Team Canada, suffering the ire of Konnan in the process. He offered his protection (to neutralize D'Amore in particular, in his own words) to the group at BFG, but Konnan thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> 3LK lost their match with Team Canada, but Kip James made the save when Team Canada beat down 3LK after the match. Team Canada held Konnan, expecting Kip to hit him with a steel chair. Instead, Kip proceeded to lay out members of Team Canada, saving Konnan instead. Later that night, after being eliminated from the 10-man Gauntlet Match to determine Jeff Jarrett's opponent for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Kip would save The Truth from elimination twice before being restrained by the referees.|$|E
25|$|While Ferraro's {{choice was}} popular among Democratic activists, polls {{immediately}} after the announcement showed that only 22% of women were excited about her selection, versus 18% who agreed that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> 60% of all voters thought that pressure from women's groups had led to Mondale's decision, versus 22% who believed that he had chosen the best available candidate. Some members of {{the hierarchy of the}} Roman Catholic Church criticized the Catholic Ferraro for being pro-choice on abortion. Already fighting an uphill battle with voters, Ferraro also faced a slew of allegations, mid-campaign, directed toward her husband, John Zaccaro. These allegations included Zaccaro's possible past involvement in organized crime, pornography distribution, and campaign contribution violations. Ferraro responded to these allegations against her husband by releasing her family tax-returns to the media on August 21, 1984. However, the damage to the campaign was already done.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Lecourbe's 10,000-man {{division}} {{embarked on}} the remarkable Engadine Campaign. By 12 March, Lecourbe reached the upper Inn River. By now the Army of Helvetia was 34,992-strong, but this campaign isolated Lecourbe {{from the rest}} of the army. On 9 March 1799, the French Directory realized that having many independent armies <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea</b> and subordinated Masséna to Jourdan. A furious Masséna submitted his resignation on the 16th. The government was firm in its decision however, and Masséna finally backed down and agreed to remain in command. It is possible that the drama may have made Masséna overly-aggressive in the next few days. By 19 March Jourdan's army was coming abreast of Masséna, with its right flank division under Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino on Lake Constance. Jourdan asked Masséna to link with Ferino at Bregenz. On the 20th Archduke Charles ordered Hotze to reinforce his army with 10,000 troops drawn from the Vorarlberg.|$|E
25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in through the window of her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E

On the July 19 episode of Raw, after being assaulted by The Nexus, Jericho began showing signs of a face turn when he teamed with rivals Edge, John Morrison, R-Truth, Daniel Bryan and Bret Hart in {{a team led by}} John Cena to face The Nexus at SummerSlam. Jericho and Cena bickered over leadership of the team, which led to him and Edge attacking Cena during the SummerSlam match that they won. According to Jericho and Edge, the original plan was to put Barrett over. At the end, Jericho and Edge would have lost to The Nexus. However, Cena insisted on coming back from a DDT on the floor to defeat Barrett and Gabriel. Jericho said that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> because Barrett was not pushed.|$|E

However, the crew decided this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea,</b> and it was changed to Rainicorn telling Jake that she is pregnant.

Samaha acknowledged that [...] "everyone thought I was crazy or mentally retarded" [...] for taking on the project, but pitched the film as [...] "Planet of the Apes starring John Travolta". Others in Hollywood were still skeptical; an unnamed producer was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying that [...] "Battlefield Earth has the stench of death. It {{should never have been}} made. It's an $80million vanity project for Travolta." [...] Travolta's theatrical agency William Morris was also said to be unenthusiastic, reportedly leading to Travolta threatening to leave them if they did not help him to set up the film. Fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise was said to have warned Warner Bros. that he thought the movie <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> Cruise's spokesperson later denied this.|$|E

Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as [...] "it was only a bit of fun. She never planned on settling down with him." [...] It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not think that she was capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to [...] "stand up to the mark and be a proper man". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.|$|E

500|$|During season ten, Rachel's brief {{romance with}} friend Joey drew strong {{criticism}} from both critics and fans, although the contested relationship did not harm viewership. Joshua Kurp of Splitsider {{believes that the}} Rachel/Joey/Ross love triangle {{is the main reason}} the show's final two seasons continued to perform well despite mediocre reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN referred to the Rachel-Joey storyline as [...] "questionable." [...] Entertainment Tonight Canada ranked [...] "The One After Rachel and Joey Kiss" [...] among the show's ten worst episodes at number five, with author I. P. Johnson panning it as [...] "desperate", concluding, [...] "Jeers for even conceiving this romantic plot; cheers for abandoning it". Contrarily, E! enjoyed Rachel and Joey as a couple because they brought out positive aspects in each other's personalities and share a similar sense of humor. Their relationship also spawned a debate among fans, who argued over whether making Rachel and Joey a couple <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> Jenna Mullins of E! determined that it is because [...] "It was too far into the series to throw these two together. They didn't make sense and their romantic scenes felt forced".|$|E

500|$|Parsons co-founded {{a company}} called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons {{invested}} his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to Miami to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>idea.</b> Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America {{on a mission to}} [...] "collect writing material"; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left [...] "flat broke" [...] by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a [...] "weak fool" [...] and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in County Causeway, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram containing an astrological, geomantic invocation of Bartzabela vengeful spirit of Mars. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was made to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for statutory rape since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California's age of consent of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to Margaret Grubb, bigamously married Sara and went on to found Dianetics and Scientology.|$|E
