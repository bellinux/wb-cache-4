Also, the problem of aging in Japanese society can cause the disappearance of satoyama because there are fewer people who can work in satoyama which are considered as intermediate disturbance on forests such as harvesting trees for timber and charcoal, cutting shrubs for firewood and collecting litter as compost.

Pines are also commercially grown and harvested for Christmas trees. [...] Pine cones, the largest and most durable of all conifer cones, are craft favorites.

A number of species are attacked by nematodes, causing pine <b>wilt</b> <b>disease,</b> which can kill some quickly. Pine needles are also used for making decorative articles like baskets, trays, pots, etc. This Native American skill is now being replicated across the world.

In this study, the effects of microelements, antioxidants, and bioagents on Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, and Macrophomina phaseolina, the causal pathogens of root rot and <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> in roselle, were examined under field conditions. Preliminary studies were carried out in vitro in order to select the most effective members to be used in field control trials. Our results showed that microelements (copper and manganese), antioxidants (salicylic acid, ascorbic acid, and EDTA), a fungicide (Dithane M 45) and biological control agents (Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis) were significantly reduced the linear growth of the causal pathogens. Additionally, application of the previous microelements, antioxidants, a fungicide and biological control agents significantly reduced disease incidence of root rot and <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> under field conditions. Copper, salicylic acid, and T. harzianum showed the best results in this respect. In conclusion, microelements, antioxidants, and biocontrol agents could be used as alternative strategies to fungicides for controlling root rot and <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> in roselle...|$|R

40|$|Pine <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> gave severe damages on Japanese pine forests, and it {{has been}} {{gradually}} decreasing after 1980 s. Meanwhile, they are spread into other East Asian countries. The diseases are caused by pine wood nematode, which is transmitted by a pine sawyer. The pesticides and nematicides have been applied for the disease control. However, it has been criticized from an environmental point of view. Moreover, the disease is not completely controlled by these efforts because of the wide target area in the forests and mountains. On the basis of these backgrounds, alternative control strategies for pine <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> are now expected. In the genus Pinus, the stilbenoids, pinosylvin and its monomethyl ether are major constitutive phenolic constituents in the heartwood. Both compounds accumulate upon biotic and abiotic stress, which may function as phytoalexins in the tree.

40|$|Soil-borne {{vascular}} <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> {{caused by}} Verticillium spp. {{are among the}} most destructive diseases worldwide {{in a wide range of}} plant species. The most effective means of controlling Verticillium <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> is the use of genetic resistance. We have previously reported the identification of four activation-tagged Arabidopsis mutants which showed enhanced resistance to Verticillium wilt. Among these, one mutant also showed enhanced resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum, a bacterial vascular wilt pathogen. Cloning of the activation tag revealed an insertion upstream of gene At 3 g 13437, which we designated as EWR 1 (for Enhancer of vascular Wilt Resistance 1) that encodes a putatively secreted protein of unknown function. The search for homologs of Arabidopsis EWR 1 (AtEWR 1) in public databases only identified homologs within the Brassicaceae family. We subsequently cloned the EWR 1 homolog from Brassica oleracea (BoEWR 1) and show that over-expression in Arabidopsis results in V. dahliae resistance. Moreover, over-expression of AtEWR 1 and BoEWR 1 in N. benthamiana, a member of the Solanaceae family, results in V. dahliae resistance, suggesting that EWR 1 homologs can be used to engineer Verticillium wilt resistance in non-Brassicaceae crops as well...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} determine some of the physiological responses caused by nematode invasion that might decrease resistance to vascular <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases.</b> The effect of RKN was investigated on spore germination and protein, carbohydrate and peroxidase content in the xylem fluids extracted from nematode-infected plants. Two cotton cultivars were used with different levels of resistance to both of the wilt pathogens. Spore germination was greater in the xylem fluids from nematode-infected plants than from nematode-free plants. The effect on spore germination was greater in the Fusarium-resistant cultivar (51 %). Analysis of these fluids showed a decrease in total protein and carbohydrate levels for both wilt-resistant cultivars, and an increase in peroxidase concentration. Fluids from nematode-free plants of the Verticillium-resistant cultivar contained 46 % more peroxidase than the Fusarium-resistant cultivar. The results provide further evidence that the effect of RKN on vascular wilt resistance is systemic and not only local.

40|$|Vascular <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> {{caused by}} soil-borne {{pathogens}} {{are among the}} most devastating plant diseases worldwide. The Verticillium genus includes vascular wilt pathogens with a wide host range. Although V. longisporum infects various hosts belonging to the Cruciferaceae, V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum cause vascular <b>wilt</b> <b>diseases</b> in over 200 dicotyledonous species, including economically important crops. A locus responsible for resistance against race 1 strains of V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum has been cloned from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) only. This locus, known as Ve, comprises two closely linked inversely oriented genes, Ve 1 and Ve 2, that encode cell surface receptor proteins of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein class of disease resistance proteins. Here, we show that Ve 1, but not Ve 2, provides resistance in tomato against race 1 strains of V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum and not against race 2 strains. Using virus-induced gene silencing in tomato, the signaling cascade downstream of Ve 1 is shown to require both EDS 1 and NDR 1. In addition, NRC 1, ACIF, MEK 2, and SERK 3 /BAK 1 also act as positive regulators of Ve 1 in tomato. In conclusion, Ve 1 -mediated resistance signaling only partially overlaps with signaling mediated by Cf proteins, type members of the receptor-like protein class of resistance proteins...|$|R
