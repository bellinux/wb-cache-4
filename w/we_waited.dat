Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.|$|E

[...] Topolski reflected: [...] "We had a great first seven minutes ... Cambridge are on a roll that has taken years to build up."

Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of the most fun parts, ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E

500|$|The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster {{was used}} as the {{location}} for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Saunders was determined to serve in the armed forces. Patriotism and his family's history of soldiering both played a major part in his decision. His father suggested that he wait six months; according to Reg, [...] "They were talking about this war being all over in six months with the Maginot Line and all the other garbage that we were told... But <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> six months and the duck season was over so there was no more shooting to do except go to war". Saunders enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 24April 1940, joining up with friends he had made while playing Australian rules football. [...] The armed forces later adopted a policy to accept only persons [...] "substantially of European origin or descent", but at the time Saunders encountered no barriers to his enlistment. He recalled that his fellow soldiers [...] "were not colour-conscious", and that during training in northern Queensland his white mates would sit alongside him in the [...] "Aboriginal" [...] section of movie theatres. His natural leadership qualities gained him temporary promotions in quick succession: within six weeks of enlistment he was a lance corporal, and after three months he made sergeant.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "I wait for Your salvation, O God," [...] Rabbi Isaac taught that {{everything}} is bound up with waiting, hoping. Suffering, the sanctification of the Divine Name, the merit of the Ancestors, and {{the desire of the}} World To Come are all bound up with waiting. Thus [...] says, [...] "Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> for You," [...] which alludes to suffering.

2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|Povestirile vieții, Lungu's {{scientific}} study of 2003, also marks his preoccupation with oral history as a path to investigating Romania's communist past, in particular the 1965-1989 regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Paul Cernat commends the work for breaking with the pattern of similar post-1989 recoveries, which mainly focus on interviews with political personalities. In contrast, Lungu's book centers on three study cases from working class environments—Florentina Ichim, Vasile Ariton and Petre Jurescu—whom the regime took pride in claiming were its support base. Their retrospective images of the era vary significantly, fluctuating between nostalgia and virulent anti-communism. However, all three witnesses recall having themselves resorted to alternative and illicit mechanisms of survival or self-promotion, in particular theft and political corruption. In his commentary on the interviews, Lungu concluded that, in some cases, the image of workers' lifestyles as offered by the propaganda apparatus was real, [...] "contrary to our expectations". He added, to Cernat's agreement: [...] "Overturning that which was officially stated during the epoch is not indicative of the real state of things and only drags us down into another ideology [...] That {{is why we have}} said: back to the facts!" [...] In his review of the book, literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu resonated with such observations, noting their revelatory aspect: [...] "once confronted with the accounts , I convinced myself once and for all that the things which, under Ceaușism, I could still believe united us into a solidarity of suffering, are as false as can be. That is, even though <b>we</b> <b>waited</b> in grueling queues, in the same cold, for the same food rations, an ocean existed between the proletariat [...] and the intellectuals, between 'base and superstructure'. We were simply put two worlds, not just figuratively, but also effectively. There was nothing for us to sell and steal, whereas they had access to the circuits of theft, to the web of programmed lawlessness." ...|$|E
