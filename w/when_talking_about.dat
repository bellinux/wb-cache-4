5|$|Although {{geographical}} {{names have been}} formally changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have also used the native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a crowd {{in the town of}} Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Norşin. Also that year, <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. <b>When</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in this desire.|$|E

25|$|Syntactically, every Boolean term {{corresponds}} to a propositional formula of propositional logic. In this translation between Boolean algebra and propositional logic, Boolean variables x,y… become propositional variables (or atoms) P,Q,…, Boolean terms such as x∨y become propositional formulas P∨Q, 0 becomes false or ⊥, and 1 becomes true or T. It is convenient when referring to generic propositions to use Greek letters Φ, Ψ,… as metavariables (variables outside the language of propositional calculus, used <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> propositional calculus) to denote propositions.|$|E

C also addresses reductions in peak demand via Demand Response (DR) programs. Demand Response does not lower total electricity demand; rather, it shifts demand out of the peak times.|$|E

25|$|Besides being {{compatible}} with the mere order relations, functions between posets may also behave well with respect to special elements and constructions. For example, <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> posets with least element, it may seem reasonable to consider only monotonic functions that preserve this element, i.e. which map least elements to least elements. If binary infima ∧ exist, then a reasonable property might be to require that f(x ∧ y) = f(x) ∧ f(y), for all x and y. All of these properties, and indeed many more, may be compiled under the label of limit-preserving functions.|$|E
25|$|We treat R1 as an {{inference}} rule, {{even though}} it is like an axiom in having no premises, because it is a domain-independent rule along with R2 and R3 common to all equational axiomatizations, whether of groups, rings, or any other variety.

In this way <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> different equational theories we can push the rules to one side as being independent of the particular theories, and confine attention to the axioms as {{the only part of the}} axiom system characterizing the particular equational theory at hand.|$|E

25|$|Better power {{efficiency}} and thickness: LCDs filter the light emitted from a backlight, allowing {{a small fraction}} of light through. Thus, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, allowing true blacks. Removing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed. When looking at top-emitting OLEDs, thickness also plays a role <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> index match layers (IMLs). Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is 1.3–2.5nbsp&nm. The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property, including the device structure parameters, also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses.|$|E

In May, Wales manager John Toshack, <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the impact of captain Ryan Giggs retiring, said that he was hopeful for the future because Ledley along with other left-sided youngsters Gareth Bale and Lewin Nyatanga were all very talented players who could play for the national team for years to come.|$|E
25|$|Some {{groups of}} Celtic fans express {{their support for}} Irish republicanism and the Irish Republican Army by singing or {{chanting}} about them at matches. IRA chanting {{has been described as}} being offensive, but opinion is divided on whether they are sectarian. UEFA head of communications William Gaillard, <b>when</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the matter in 2006, said that IRA chanting was a nationalist issue and was similar to fans of other clubs, such as Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who support nationalist movements in their own countries. He also stated that only in Balkan countries, where some fans show support for organisations that had engaged in ethnic cleansing, was the situation different because these organisations were by their nature discriminatory. He said that this did not apply to the IRA.|$|E
