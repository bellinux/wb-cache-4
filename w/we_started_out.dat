500|$|The new {{creative}} team, {{while avoiding}} references aimed specifically at adults, {{was determined not}} to adapt the humour to children or otherwise patronise their audience. Instead, they sought to make the best use possible of the material. Norris said that her goal was [...] "to make a show that people would say was too good for children... <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> with really high ambitions." [...] To that end, adult historical satires such as Blackadder and the Monty Python films were shown at the first writers' meeting to demonstrate the proposed tone, and these influences would be visible throughout the show's run.|$|E
500|$|Hamm was {{not allowed}} to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Warren Skaaren, who had also worked on Burton's Beetlejuice, did rewrites. Jonathan Gems and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming. Only Skaaren {{received}} screenplay credit with Hamm. Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros. Burton explained, [...] "I don't understand why that became such a problem. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work." [...] Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot. Bob Kane supported this decision.|$|E

500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote things that he initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rex Reed in his book People Are Crazy Here (1974), Baker revealed that she had felt pressure in both her working relationship with Levine, and her domestic life with her husband, the latter of whom she said wanted to maintain an expensive lifestyle: [...] "We'd been very poor when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> at the Actors Studio in New York," [...] she told Reed. [...] "I was under contract to Joe Levine, who was going around giving me diamonds and behaving like he owned me. I never slept with him or anything, but everyone thought I was his mistress." [...] In the spring of 1966, Baker returned to theatre, performing in a production of Anna Christie at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by [...] Garfein. The production was heralded as the [...] "theatre event of the week" [...] in Los Angeles, though its reception was middling. Cecil Smith of The Los Angeles Times wrote of the production: [...] "The beautiful Miss Baker's vehicle becomes a hearse." [...] The play was also performed at the Tappan Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York in June 1966.|$|E
500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> together, people are going to say things like that.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 4 ("Why there almost {{certainly}} is no God"), Dawkins sums up his argument and states, [...] "The temptation [...] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable". In addition, chapter 4 asserts that the alternative to the designer hypothesis is not chance, but natural selection.|$|E

She considers the two {{to be part of a}} unified whole, and opposes attempts to segregate writers and fans by increasingly specific subgenre definitions. Regarding this issue, she has written, [...] " [...] don't like this specialization in which one side sniffs at the other as if they were some other species. No, no, no. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> one creature. I don't care if 'they' have spots. We're still the same breed of cat." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cars {{featured}} {{a large amount}} of technology on many of its tracks, due to the band's appreciation for new equipment. David Robinson said, [...] "We'd always get the latest stuff from music stores even if it would be obsolete in two months. It reached the point where I'd have 10 or 12 foot switches to hit during a short set." [...] The album also is notable for front-man Ric Ocasek's use of irony and sarcasm. Keyboardist Greg Hawkes said, [...] "There was definitely a little self-conscious irony in there. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> wanting to be electric and straight-ahead rock, and it kind of turned into an artier kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} {{these large}} objects, we might {{also want to}} see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. [...] It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object [...] "one greater than infinity" [...] exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.|$|E

We got to the game before we got to the name. We realized we were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, so we thought what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost {{the spirit of}} their forefathers, copying each other in design and sound, becoming all the same. As far back as 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands [...] "after X" [...] makeup and outrageous looks became [...] "more important than music". Several older musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said [...] "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way {{because they want to}} be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is obviously very different from when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> more than ten years ago.", while Sugizo (Luna Sea) that [...] "they cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music".|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described Monster as [...] "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." [...] He explained, [...] "That's not what <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, but is it really?" [...] Mike Mills told Time, [...] "On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be." [...] Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix. Buck's guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson from Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. for some of the Monster Tour.|$|E
