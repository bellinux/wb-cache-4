50|$|The <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Glyphorynchus spirurus), is a {{passerine}} bird which breeds in {{the tropical}} New World from southern Mexico to northern Bolivia, central Brazil and the Guianas; it is absent from the Pacific coastal areas except between Costa Rica and Ecuador. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Glyphorynchus.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is characterized}} by open forests of palms and bamboos.255 species of birds {{have been found in}} the alluvial forests, and 189 species in the open forests.The first occurrence in Brazil of several species of birds was first recorded in the ecological station, including sapphire-spangled emerald (Amazilia lactea), Guianan warbling antbird (Hypocnemis cantator), buff-fronted foliage-gleaner (Philydor rufum), <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Glyphorynchus spirurus), Tschudi's woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus ocellatus chunchotambo) and russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons).|$|E
50|$|It {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from its relatives by its small size and distinctive bill. The <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> is typically 14-15 cm long, and weighs 14-16.5 g. It has brown upperparts, with fine streaking {{on the head}} sides, a buff supercilium, and a chestnut rump, wings and tail. The throat is buff, {{and the rest of}} the underparts are brown spotted with buff chevrons, most heavily on the breast. A buff wing bar is obvious from below in flight. The short wedge-shaped bill is quite different in shape from that of other woodcreepers. Young birds are duller with less distinct breast streaking.|$|E
5000|$|The woodcreepers are {{generally}} fairly uniform in appearance. They {{range in size}} from the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (13 cm) to the strong-billed woodcreeper (35 cm). Males tend to be slightly larger than females on average, but considerable overlap in size occurs in most species. Pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and plumage is rare. Bill size and shape accounts for much of the variation between the species. Bills can be straight or highly decurved, and can account for as much as a quarter of the length of the bird (as happens in the long-billed woodcreeper). The plumage is usually subdued and often brown, or sometimes rufous or other dark colours. Many species have patterns such as checking, spotting, or barring on their plumage. The feathers of the tail are rigid and are used for supporting the body when climbing tree trunks; the tail can support most of the body weight and birds that lose their tail find climbing difficult. Woodcreepers climb by flexing their legs and hopping up the trunk. The feet of the woodcreepers are also modified for climbing. The front toes are strongly clawed and toe IV is as long as toe III to increase the ability of the bird to grasp around branches. The legs are short but strong. Woodcreepers are also characterized by a belly feather growth pattern not found in any other birds.|$|E
40|$|The <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Glyphorynchus spirurus) is {{a common}} {{understory}} suboscine passerine of lowland Neotropical rainforests. It frequently joins mixed-species understory flocks but also regularly forages alone, and thus is an excellent model species on which to conduct comparative behavioral observations to examine the hypothesized {{costs and benefits of}} flock-following. Individuals exhibit variable flocking propensities (proportion of time spent with flocks), and thus observing the correlations between flocking propensity and physical and environmental factors can provide further insight into the importance of flock-following to the ecology of this species. Despite its abundance at many sites and its wide geographic range, surprisingly few studies have focused on the ecology and behavior of this species; previous observations suggested that this species occupies large, overlapping home ranges, which has important implications for intraspecific interactions and flock-following behavior. This study had three primary objectives: 1) to compare the foraging behavior and movement patterns of the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> in and out of flocks to examine the importance of hypothesized costs and benefits of flock-following for this species; 2) to determine which physical and environmental factors have the greatest influence on individual flocking propensity; and 3) to quantify the extent of home range overlap among individuals and to examine the influence of this overlap on space use and flock-following behavior. Wedge-billed woodcreepers used more open microhabitats in flocks than alone, supporting an anti-predator hypothesis for the benefit of flocking behavior. A decrease in time spent per trunk in flocks than alone, and a decrease in time spent with a flock with increasing movement rate, suggests an energetic cost associated with following flocks. Average flocking propensity was 32 % in 2011 and 20 % in 2012, considerably lower than previously reported in the literature and predicted under the assumption that individuals always join a flock when one is present in the home range. Body mass was the strongest predictor of individual flocking propensity, with larger individuals spending more time in flocks, and the correlation between the differences in body mass and flocking propensities of overlapping neighbors suggests that larger individuals may exclude smaller individuals from flocks. The distribution of flock-following locations was not influenced by the space use of larger neighbors, although a rigorous examination of simultaneous space use, coupled with a genetic analysis to determine if any overlapping neighbors are genetically related, would be necessary to provide a robust test of this hypothesis. Home ranges overlapped extensively in this study, thus the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> does not appear to defend exclusive home ranges at this site, unlike most other understory insectivores including other woodcreepers. Finally, in order to provide additional information about the behavior and natural history of this species, this dissertation includes a chapter that describes a previously known display behavior and provides notes about incubation and fledgling care...|$|E
40|$|Background Glucocorticoids are adrenal steroid hormones {{essential}} to homeostatic maintenance. Their daily variation at low concentrations regulates physiology and behavior to sustain proper immunological and metabolic function. Glucocorticoids rise well above these baseline levels during stress to elicit emergency-state responses that increase short-term survival. Despite this essence in managing life processes under both regular and adverse conditions, relationships of glucocorticoid release to environmental and intrinsic factors that vary at daily and seasonal scales are rarely {{studied in the}} wild. Methods This study on 41 passerine species of the Ecuadorian Choc√≥ applied a standardized capture-and-restraint protocol to examine diurnal variation in baseline and stress-related release of corticosterone, the primary avian glucocorticoid. Tests for relationships to relative body mass, hemoglobin concentration, molt status and date complemented this evaluation {{of the time of}} day effect on corticosterone secretion in free-living tropical rainforest birds. Analyses were also partitioned by sex as well as performed separately on two common species, the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> and olive-striped flycatcher. Results Interspecific analyses indicated maximum baseline corticosterone levels {{at the onset of the}} active phase and reductions thereafter. Stress-related levels did not correspond to time of day but accompanied baseline reductions during molt and elevations in birds sampled later during the September - November study period. Baseline corticosterone related negatively to hemoglobin in the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> and stress-related levels increased with body mass in the olive-striped flycatcher. There were no substantial sex-related differences. Conclusions The results of this study suggest a diurnal rhythmicity in baseline corticosterone release so robust as to emerge in pooled analyses across a highly variable dataset. While this detection in nature is singular, correspondent patterns have been demonstrated outside of the tropics in captive model species. Congruity in daily rhythms and links to physiological and life-history state across disparate taxa and environments may promote the yet unresolved utility of corticosterone release as a global metric for population health. However, certain results of this study also deviate from laboratory and field research at higher latitudes, cautioning generalization. Environmental distinctions such as high productivity and tempered seasonality may precipitate unique life-history strategies and underlying hormonal mechanisms in tropical rainforest birds...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} how environment shapes phenotypic and genetic variation, we explore the relationship between environmental variables across Ecuador and genetic and morphological variation in the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper</b> (Glyphorynchus spirurus), a common Neotropical rainforest bird species. Generalized dissimilarity models show that variation in amplified fragment length polymorphism markers was strongly associated with environmental variables {{on both sides of}} the Andes, but could also partially be explained by geographic distance on the western side of the Andes. Tarsus, wing, tail, and bill lengths and bill depth were well explained by environmental variables on the western side of the Andes, whereas only tarsus length was well explained on the eastern side. Regions that comprise the highest rates of genetic and phenotypic change occur along steep elevation gradients in the Andes. Such environmental gradients are likely to be particularly important for maximizing adaptive diversity to minimize the impacts of climate change. Using a framework for conservation prioritization based on preserving ecological and evolutionary processes, we found little overlap between currently protected areas in Ecuador and regions we predicted to be important in maximizing adaptive variation...|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{relative}} roles of vicariance and selection in restricting gene flow between populations is of central {{importance to the}} evolutionary process of population divergence and speciation. Here we use molecular and morphological data to contrast the effect of isolation (by mountains and geographical distance) with that of ecological factors (altitudinal gradients) in promoting differentiation in the <b>wedge-billed</b> <b>woodcreeper,</b> Glyphorynchus spirurus, a tropical forest bird, in Ecuador. Tarsus length and beak size increased relative to body size with altitude {{on both sides of}} the Andes, and were correlated with the amount of moss on tree trunks, suggesting the role of selection in driving adaptive divergence. In contrast, molecular data revealed a considerable degree of admixture along these altitudinal gradients, suggesting that adaptive divergence in morphological traits has occurred in the presence of gene flow. As suggested by mitochondrial DNA sequence data, the Andes act as a barrier to gene flow between ancient subspecific lineages. Genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism markers reflected more recent patterns of gene flow and revealed fine-scale patterns of population differentiation that were not detectable with mitochondrial DNA, including the differentiation of isolated coastal populations west of the Andes. Our results support the predominant role of geographical isolation in driving genetic differentiation in G. spirurus, yet suggest the role of selection in driving parallel morphological divergence along ecological gradients...|$|E
