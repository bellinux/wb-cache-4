5|$|Anthony Taylor was {{the referee}} for the final. It {{was his first}} match {{involving}} Chelsea since December 2014, when he erroneously booked Cesc Fàbregas for diving <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> fouled by Southampton's Matt Targett; Taylor apologised to Chelsea for that decision.|$|E
5|$|One of Gheorghe Tătărescu's last {{appearances}} in public was his stand {{as one of}} the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year lease on the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E

5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} Swiss Confederacy, too. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
5|$|Perceval {{had led the}} Tory {{government}} since 1809, during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, and apparent certainty that his action was justified, raised questions about his sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E

25|$|The army in Goa at {{that time}} was {{dominated}} by whites and mestiços. They eventually organised a coup in Goa and removed Peres from his post on 1 February.

In his place, the previous Viceroy Manuel de Portugal e Castro was appointed Governor.|$|E

25|$|At the {{watering}} place of Kingstown, Trollope met Rose Heseltine, {{the daughter of}} a Rotherham bank manager. They became engaged <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in Ireland for a year; because of Trollope's debts and her lack of a fortune, they were unable to marry until 1844. Soon after their marriage, Trollope transferred to another postal district in the south of Ireland, and the family moved to Clonmel.|$|E
25|$|After Ernani, Verdi had {{considered}} {{a large number}} of projects for the future and the Byron play was one of them. Foscari had even been considered as early as 1843 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> approached by La Fenice in Venice, but it was rejected as unsuitable because the story included criticism of actions of the Republic of Venice which may have been offensive to the great families who had governed the Republic, including the extant Foscari family.|$|E

25|$|Javed Naseer Rind was {{an editor}} and {{columnist}} for the Urdu-language Daily Tawar, which {{is known as a}} pro-independence and anti-government newspaper that is based in Quetta.

A London-based source said that Rind had been fired and lost his position within the movement <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in communication with him while reporting on the UK trial of Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch on charges of terrorism.|$|E
25|$|In December 1942 Dempsey was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general to command XIII Corps of the British Eighth Army in North Africa. Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, had first spotted Dempsey's potential <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> one of his students at the Staff College. On arrival in Cairo, Egypt, Dempsey found his corps HQ in reserve because the long lines of communication to Eighth Army's spearhead could only sustain two corps (XXX Corps and X Corps). Dempsey was therefore employed in the planning of the invasion of Sicily and led his corps in the assault on Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
25|$|Following the Hidalgo affair, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{required}} by the radical government to sign a decree against the artillery officers, Amadeus famously declared the people of Spain to be ungovernable, and fled the country. In his absence, a coalition of radicals, republicans, and democrats formed a government and on 11 February 1873 proclaimed the First Spanish Republic, which was immediately under siege from all quarters. The Carlists were the most immediate threat, launching a violent insurrection after their poor showing in the 1872 elections. There were calls for socialist revolution from the International Workingmen's Association and pressure from the Catholic Church against the fledgling republic.|$|E
