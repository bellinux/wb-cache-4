5|$|As Hogue {{approached}} her sinking sister, the ship's captain, Wilmot Nicholson, {{realized that it}} had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> had been open, and she sank at 07:15.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the British force caught Tirpitz by surprise. While the {{aircraft}} had first been {{picked up by a}} German radar station shortly after they crossed the Norwegian coastline, the battleship was not immediately warned. At the time of the attack Tirpitz was preparing to sail for her high-speed trials, and her crew were busy unmooring the vessel. Her five protective destroyers had already departed for the trials area in Stjern Sound. The warning from the radar station arrived shortly before the British aircraft appeared over Kaafjord, and the battleship's crew were {{still in the process of}} moving to their battle stations when the attack commenced; at this time not all of the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were closed and some damage-control stations were not fully manned.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> could not close, and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even though most of the crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> along the bulkhead.

5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55. As Hogue approached her sinking sister, Captain Wilmot Nicholson realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water. Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again. The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> had been open and sank at 07:15.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, an {{expedition}} led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This {{was the first}} expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using closed circuit rebreathers (CCR). Diver Rich Stevenson found that several <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> were open. It {{has been suggested that}} this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK's Channel 5.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{subdivided}} into an eleven watertight compartments,so proportioned {{that the ship}} would float if any two adjacent compartments became flooded. The <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> throughout the ship were operated on the Stone-Lloyd system that enabled all doors to be closed instantly and simultaneously from the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Exploration of Andrea Dorias impact area {{revealed}} that the Stockholms bow had ripped a much larger gash in the critical area of the large fuel tanks and watertight compartments of the Italian liner than had been thought in 1956. The question of the [...] "missing" [...] <b>watertight</b> <b>door,</b> although still unanswered, was probably moot: Andrea Doria was doomed immediately after the collision.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} damaged <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> of the firemen's tunnel, the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> between boiler rooms six and five failed to close properly. Water was flowing further aft into boiler room five. Britannic had reached her {{flooding}} limit. She could stay afloat (motionless) {{with her first}} six watertight compartments flooded. There were five watertight bulkheads rising {{all the way up}} to B Deck. Those measures had been taken after the Titanic disaster. (Titanic could float with her first four compartments flooded.) The next crucial bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four and its door were undamaged and should have guaranteed the ship's survival. However, there were open portholes along the lower decks, which tilted underwater within minutes of the explosion. The nurses had opened most of those portholes to ventilate the wards. As the ship's angle of list increased, water reached this level and began entering aft from the bulkhead between boiler rooms five and four. With more than six compartments flooded, Britannic could not stay afloat.|$|R
50|$|Scott {{leads the}} {{survivors}} to the propeller shaft room's <b>watertight</b> <b>door,</b> but another series of explosions causes Linda {{to fall to}} her death. A heartbroken Rogo blames her death on Scott. A ruptured pipe releases steam, blocking their escape. Scott rants at God for the survivors' deaths. He leaps and grabs onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut off the steam, then tells Rogo to lead the group before letting go of it, falling to his death in the flaming water below.|$|R
25|$|Later, in a 1998 {{documentary}} titled Titanic: Secrets Revealed, the Discovery Channel ran model simulations {{which also}} rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> {{would have caused}} the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank {{by more than one}} half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics <b>watertight</b> <b>doors.</b> This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even keel}} and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
25|$|Mallison and Chapman {{spent the}} first few hours sorting out the {{submersible}} which was almost upside down. They checked all the <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> for leaks and prepared for rescue to come. To preserve oxygen {{they knew they had}} to make as little physical exertion as possible, not even speaking. They made themselves as comfortable as possible as high up as they could get to avoid the foul air that sank down.|$|E
2500|$|LST-464 was {{converted}} into a [...] "first aid ship" [...] at Sydney, Australia, in 1943. These modifications included the installation in the tank deck bulkhead of a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> to allow access to the forward troop compartment from both the starboard and port sides of the ship. Spaces were also converted to receiving, sterilizer, and operating rooms. On the tank deck, 78 hospital beds, refrigerators, lockers, toilets and wash basins were installed. LST-464s medical staff was increased to six doctors, one dentist {{and a number of}} corpsmen.|$|R
5000|$|Correct {{grammatical}} tagging will reflect that [...] "dogs" [...] is here {{used as a}} verb, not as the more common plural noun.

50|$|Trapped on the bottom, the {{survivors}} {{gather in the}} control room; Sempter and Sturm square off, asserting command, while Diana exposes Sturm's madness. Sempter takes control and organizes the crew's escape. In a detailed and substantially accurate technical sequence, Diana and the crew exit through the sub's escape trunk using Momsen lungs, and are rescued at the surface. Refusing to leave the ship, Sturm stays behind and lapses into raving insanity; he opens a <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> to let in the sea, laughing maniacally as the water rises.|$|R
25|$|Each {{engine was}} located in a {{separate}} watertight engine compartment. In case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, with <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded.|$|E
25|$|Others {{called to}} give {{testimony}} included Phillip A. S. Franklin, Vice President of International Mercantile Marine Co., the shipping consortium headed by J. P. Morgan that controlled White Star Line. The inquiry concluded with Smith visiting Titanics sister ship Olympic in port in New York on 25 May 1912, where he interviewed {{some members of}} the crew and inspected the ship's system of <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and bulkheads, which was identical to that of Titanic.|$|E
25|$|Captain Turner of Lusitania {{was given}} a warning message twice {{on the evening of}} 6 May, and took what he felt were prudent precautions. He closed <b>watertight</b> <b>doors,</b> posted double lookouts, ordered a black-out, and had the {{lifeboats}} swung out on their davits so that they could be launched quickly if necessary. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first class lounge.|$|E

5000|$|When [...] "fire in engineroom lower level" [...] was announced, due {{to water}} in the main lube oil pump motors, {{a man in the}} aft end of engineroom upper level opened the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> into the stern room, which swung into the stern room, to {{retrieve}} a fire extinguisher. Just then the up-angle increased dramatically and the bilge water began pouring in. The door was shut before the boat surfaced. With the boat on an even keel, the water came up to the deadlight in the door.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} a {{preliminary}} to a modification concept of the sliding <b>watertight</b> bulkhead <b>door</b> used on ships and vessels. Hydraulic or electro-hydraulic drives used to move these doors require complicated and extended pressure installations with large amounts of hydraulic fluid. Well-known operational drawbacks of these installations include high level of noise and possibility of various leaks in the hydraulic system. Being {{the first in a}} series, the present article describes and analyses critical states which can take place during evacuation of people through openings in the <b>watertight</b> bulkhead <b>doors</b> on seagoing ships and vessels...|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Olympic {{assisted}} with both the American and British inquiries into the disaster. Deputations from both inquiries inspected Olympics lifeboats, <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and bulkheads and other equipment which were identical to those on Titanic. Sea tests were performed for the British enquiry in May 1912, to establish how quickly the ship could turn two points at various speeds, to approximate {{how long it would}} have taken Titanic to turn when it sighted the iceberg.|$|E
25|$|While the Tennessees and Pennsylvanias {{shared the}} same number of {{transverse}} bulkheads, the Tennessees were built with a greater amount of longitudinal subdivision. The inner bottom, subdivided into 35 watertight compartments, extended from the keel to the protective deck at each side and fore and aft to the knuckle of the keel. Underwater protection was further increased by continuing this subdivision up the complete side of the subsurface hull to the lower edge of the armored deck slopes. Twenty-eight electrically operated Long-Arm <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> and five armored hatches helped maintain watertight integrity beneath the armored deck.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett {{ordered the}} <b>watertight</b> <b>doors</b> closed, sent a {{distress}} signal, {{and ordered the}} crew to prepare the lifeboats. An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them were HMS Scourge and HMS Heroic, but Britannic heard nothing in reply; unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, {{the force of the}} first explosion had caused the aerial communication wires slung between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that although the ship could still send out transmissions by wireless, she could no longer receive them.|$|E
50|$|Their {{situation}} now called for original thinking. They reasoned that sufficient buoyancy in the after section could tilt the sub {{on her nose}} and extend the stern above the surface. The tilt would cause {{the water in the}} motor room to drain forward and increase buoyancy further. However, there was great risk involved because this would allow salt water into the battery room, which would generate deadly chlorine gas. They hoped to have enough time, after the water had entered, to close the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> before the gas could reach a dangerous level.|$|R
50|$|Swenning was {{a member}} of the Forward Repair Party when New Orleans was struck by a torpedo which detonated the forward magazines. He unhesitatingly dived through the oil and water in a flooded {{compartment}} to close a <b>watertight</b> <b>door.</b> In further efforts to assist in bringing the damaged ship to port, he labored tirelessly and continuously for twelve hours after the cessation of the action. His courageous devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. Swenning died on 1 December 1942 and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.|$|R
50|$|On 6 May 1956, off the Virginia Capes, the {{battleship}} USS Wisconsin (BB-64) {{collided with the}} Eaton in thick fog while daylight steaming at high speed (20 knots). The collision caused serious damage to both ships, with the Eaton contacting {{the battleship}}'s bow on the starboard side forward of the bridge, which crushed to port side and broke the keel. The CPO mess area and mess deck were smashed. The ship's 1st LT saved her by securing bow to stern with anchor chain, and closing the <b>watertight</b> <b>door</b> beside his room. Only one sailor (a cook) was struck unconscious. Commander Richard Varley of the Eaton was later court-martialed and found negligent.|$|R
