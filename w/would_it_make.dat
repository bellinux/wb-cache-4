6000|$|... "But <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> {{his life}} harder {{if we were}} to see each other sometimes?" [...] said Philip. He was going to say {{something}} else, but checked himself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A thought strikes me,' he said. 'The fifty-fifty {{proposition}} {{does not}} impress you. <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> things easier if I were to offer my cooperation {{for a mere}} quarter of the profit?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I be. I ain't a landlord, nor I ain't young--nor anxious. Oh, Mus' Midmore! <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> any odds {{about her}} thirty pounds comin' regular if I married her? Charlie said maybe 'twould.' ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. No. I told Harry she {{was because}} I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for him.|$|R
60|$|Then {{quickly he}} {{explained}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> so much better for both if they became engaged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>would!</b> <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> me so tired," [...] asseverated Mrs. Arty, [...] "to {{think of}} the old goats that men put up for {{candidates}} when they know they're solemn old fools! I'd just like {{to get out and}} vote my head off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that be {{all your}} difficulty, I will furnish you with paper {{and every other}} material, and you may write your letter {{whenever}} you choose. <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> you happy to write to William?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] I said, forgetting for {{the first}} time to add [...] "young lady," [...] "what do I care? If he were in hiding twenty times over, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> one thought of change in you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, {{you don't}} suppose I could wait a {{fortnight}} {{without trying to}} get a glimpse of you, even though you had declined to meet me! <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> you angry to know that I have been along this path at dusk three or four times since our last meeting? Well, how are you?" ...|$|E
25|$|Business {{leaders in}} Staffordshire, now {{effectively}} closer to London, welcomed {{the opening of}} the road, saying that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier to do business there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder for you," [...] said Fraser. [...] "But didnâ€™t you {{remember}} Miss Banks while {{all this was}} going on?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 2017 the Liberal National Party {{requested}} that the Australian Electoral Commission redistribute {{the boundaries of the}} Dickson electorate in a manner which would benefit Dutton in the upcoming 2018 election. The proposed boundary change would add more conservative constituents to Dickson, however, this would remove them from the neighbouring marginal divisions of Longman and Petrie. While <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for Dutton to win his seat of Dickson, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder for his neighbouring Liberals to win their own divisions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, my dear; {{do not say}} that. <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> {{me happy}} {{that you should be}} a {{prisoner}} here for ever? It was only when I seemed to get so weak that I thought about it. I felt that it must be near when they bade me not to go to the cathedral any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> you {{strong or}} happy {{to go and}} live as a {{dependent}} amongst utter strangers? It would not. And the experiment must not be tried; I tell you it would fail. It is not in your nature to bear the desolate life governesses generally lead; you would fall ill. I won't hear of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if we men {{can prevent}} it. What {{kind of a}} report <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> if I were forced to say, 'At this {{critical}} moment the charming Miss So-and-so came to my aid, and, by inviting the men in to dinner with a sweet smile, completely disarmed their hostility. Too much honor cannot be given,' etc." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tarr {{wrote one}} play, [...] "The New Frontier," [...] a comedy that held tryouts in New Haven and Philadelphia, {{with the hope}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to Broadway.|$|R
5000|$|He took sides {{during the}} {{controversy}} {{about the movie}} Valley of the Wolves Iraq, and predicted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to film history, emphasizing [...] "God bless the Turks." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{disagreed}} with Articles 257 and 259, which barred politicians from interfering {{in the work}} of bureaucrats, claiming that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> difficult for governments to implement their policies.|$|R
60|$|ANN. After all, though, what {{difference}} <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make?</b> Beauty {{is all very}} well at first sight; but who ever looks at it when {{it has been in}} the house three days? I thought our pictures very lovely when papa bought them; but I haven't looked at them for years. You never bother about my looks: you are too well used to me. I might be the umbrella stand.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} fatal thought came to him--why should he {{restrain}} himself? What was this girl to him? Had he not always hated {{her and her}} kind? Did she not look with loathing and contempt upon him? And to whom did her life belong anyway but to him--had he not saved it twice? What difference <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make?</b> They'd never {{come out of this}} savage world alive, and if he didn't take her some monkey-faced Chink would get her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will help}} you," [...] replied the Negro, [...] "to keep them within this room, {{but do not}} fear that their outcries will bring others. These walls are built so that no sound may pass through, {{and even if it}} did what {{difference}} <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> in this village which is constantly filled with the screams of its mad people. Do not fear their cries. No one will notice them. I go to do your bidding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Bowen! And {{you think}} that would be a {{mitigating}} circumstance in his acceptance of money from her? If he had the spirit of a man at all, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> all the more revolting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. That was why I put `You in front' upon my letter. I {{thought that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier. But if you <b>would</b> prefer <b>it</b> I {{will stop the}} machine, {{and then you can}} sit round and talk about it." ...|$|R
50|$|In October 2014, the Abbott {{government}} announced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for businesses {{to apply for}} 457 visa workers by relaxing rules for English language competency to broaden the pool of potential workers from overseas.|$|R
6000|$|She had {{no great}} desire for that repast, {{though it was}} served in Rincer's {{well-known}} style, as the county paper said, giving {{an account of the}} entertainment afterwards; indeed, she was very distraite; and exceedingly pained and unhappy about Pen. Captious and quarrelsome; jealous and selfish; fickle and violent and unjust when his anger led him astray; how could her mother (as indeed Helen had by a thousand words and hints) ask her to give her heart to such a man? and suppose she were to do so, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> him happy? ...|$|E
60|$|O {{that these}} things did take place in your hearts, how <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> you to seek after rest for your souls before it be too late, before the sun of the gospel be set upon you! Consider, I say, the misery of the ungodly that they shall be in, and avoid their vices, by closing in with the tenders of mercy; lest you partake of the same portion with them, and cry out in the {{bitterness}} of your souls, One drop of cold water to cool my tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go ahead an' rest. I'll {{take your}} horses to grass." [...] Euchre left Duane {{alone in the}} house. Duane relaxed then, and {{mechanically}} he wiped {{the sweat from his}} face. He was laboring under some kind of a spell or shock which did not pass off quickly. When it had worn away he took off his coat and belt and made himself comfortable on the blankets. And he had a thought that if he rested or slept what difference <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> on the morrow? No rest, no sleep could change the gray outlook of the future. He felt glad when Euchre came bustling in, {{and for the first time}} he took notice of the outlaw.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't cry," [...] {{she said}} drearily. [...] "I wish I could. I've a dreadful feeling here--" [...] {{she touched her}} slender throat--"and if I could cry I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better. But I can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|HAKE Well, you see, miss, in my case, I rarely {{getting home}} much before midnight, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> so late. Yesterday being my night off, things fitted in, so to speak. Will {{there be any}} writing, miss? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took the}} risk of your writing to St. John; but then I {{realized}} that if he answered and told you what I ought to have told you myself, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> worse, and I came back." ...|$|R
6000|$|On reflection, I {{still think}} I am right. The allusions {{in his letter}} to the {{preparations}} made for the expedition to Central America, all show that the leaders of it know it to be dangerous. If the discovery of this makes me uneasy, what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> HER? It is bad enough to feel that his departure has deprived us of the friend of all others to whose devotion we could trust in the hour of need, if ever that hour comes and finds us helpless; but it is far worse to know that he has gone from us to face the perils of a bad climate, a wild country, and a disturbed population. Surely it would be a cruel candour to tell Laura this, without a pressing and a positive necessity for it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Distinctly mentioned! Of {{course it}} was {{distinctly}} mentioned. There are some things which can't be kept under a bushel, Dr. Grantly; and {{this seems to be}} one of them. Your going about in this way won't make Lord Dumbello marry the young lady." [...] That was true; nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> Mrs. Proudie hold her tongue. Perhaps the archdeacon was wrong in his present errand, and so he now began to bethink himself. [...] "At any rate," [...] said he, [...] "when I tell you that there is no ground whatever for such a report you will do me the kindness to say that, as far as you are concerned, it shall go no further. I think, my lord, I am not asking too much in asking that." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{how many}} of you <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> any difference? To some of you, thank God, I believe it would make a difference. Here are some here, I believe, who would feel that news the worst news they ever heard,--worse than if they were told that their souls were lost for ever; there are some here, I do believe, who, at that news, would cry aloud in agony, like little {{children}} who had lost their father, and say, 'No Father in heaven to love? No blessed Jesus in heaven to work for, and die for, and glory and delight in? No God to rule and manage this poor, miserable, quarrelsome world, bringing good out of evil, blessing and guiding all things and people on earth? What do I care what becomes of my soul if there is no God for my soul to glory in? What is heaven worth without God? God is Heaven!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} will be the best plan," [...] Jim agreed. [...] "I do not know that <b>it</b> will <b>make</b> much {{difference}} in the end, for they must be left tied somewhere; still, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>make</b> <b>it</b> safer for us." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> better citizens, honest citizens. One of {{the best}} gifts a millionaire could make would be a theatre here and a theatre there. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> of you a real Republic, and bring about an {{educational}} level.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "whether {{you have any}} very decided {{objections}} to sitting down {{with us in the}} saloon? If you have, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> necessary for Nellie or me to bring the things out to you." ...|$|R
