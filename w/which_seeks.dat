5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language.

5|$|Every Mother Counts 2012 is {{the second}} album in Starbucks' annual series (following the 2011 album of the same name), {{released}} by its retail music concept and record label Hear Music.

5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E

Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.|$|E
5|$|McEntee {{has sought}} to raise {{awareness}} of suicide-related issues since her father's death, and in 2013 joined the launch of a suicide prevention campaign by the Pieta House charity, aimed at educating rural communities about the early warning signs of suicide. She also took part in a sponsored walk from Dublin to Navan for the See the Light campaign, <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> {{to raise awareness of}} mental health issues. However, she told the Irish Independent that she does not want the focus to be on her father's death every time she attends a suicide prevention event.|$|E

5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to explain human behavior as intrinsically {{linked with the}} environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|This {{synthesis}} cemented {{natural selection}} {{as the foundation}} of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about {{at the end of the}} 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo"), <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a total ouster or {{finality}} clause <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> {{to preclude}} judicial review entirely, a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted {{period of time}} after which no remedy will be available.

5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host star {{at a distance}} of 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, <b>which</b> <b>seeks</b> to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E

He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program.
