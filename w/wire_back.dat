500|$|Operation Tracer was a top-secret British stay-behind spying {{mission that}} was only to be {{implemented}} if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers. Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year. The volunteers—two doctors, three signalmen and their leader—would run an observation post with one [...] by [...] slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean. The team would then <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> all shipping movements to the British Admiralty.|$|E

60|$|Another time Spears, the wily old fox, {{succeeded in}} detaining Nan {{on the way}} to the station, and the two missed the train. At first the Rube laughed with the others, but when Stringer remarked that he had noticed a growing {{attachment}} between Nan and Spears, my great pitcher experienced the first pangs of the green-eyed monster. We had to hold him to keep him from jumping from the train, and it took Milly and Mrs. Stringer to soothe him. I had to <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> to Rochester for a special train for Spears and Nan, and even then we had to play half a game without the services of our captain.|$|E
50|$|Note, {{when you}} are using an {{automation}} system, {{there is no need}} to install any electrical cabling to the light switches. In a traditional electrical installation without automation the lights in a room would be <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the light switch which in turn would be <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the switchboard or some similar arrangement, so keep reading.|$|R

50|$|ElectricalThis is cabling {{installed}} {{from the}} electrical switchboard {{to the light}} fitting or any other device {{that is to be}} controlled by the automation system. For example, if you have four down lights in a room and you wish to control each light individually, then each light will be <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> using electrical cabling back to the electrical switchboard. This means you will have four electrical cables installed from the electrical switchboard to the location where the light fittings will be installed. Each cable will be a three core active, neutral and earth cable.If in that room you also have a free standing lamp plugged into a power point and you also want to control this from your automation system, you will need to have that power point individually <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the electrical switchboard.So if you want to individually control every light fitting and every power point or power outlets then each one of these devices must be individually <b>wired</b> <b>back</b> to the electrical switchboard. As you can see this start to become quite a lot of electrical cabling so planning is essential.|$|R

He hed plenty of money--Mex, they said. An' all the Greasers was crazy about him. Called him El Capitan. He got drunk an' went roarin' round fer Pat Hawe. You {{remember}} that Greaser who was plugged last October--the night Miss Majesty arrived? Wal, he's daid. He's daid, an' people says thet Pat is a-goin' to lay thet killin' onto Gene. I reckon thet's jest talk, though Pat is mean enough to do it, if he hed the nerve. Anyway, if he was in El Cajon he kept mighty much to hisself. Gene walked up an' down, up an' down, all day an' night, lookin' fer Pat. But he didn't find him. An', of course, he kept gettin' drunker. He jest got plumb bad. He made lots of trouble, but there wasn't no gun-play. Mebbe thet made him sore, so he went an' licked Flo's brother-in-law. Thet wasn't so bad. Jack sure needed a good lickin'. Wal, then Gene met Danny an' tried to get Danny drunk. An' he couldn't! What do you think of that? Danny hedn't been drinkin'--wouldn't touch a drop. I'm sure glad of thet, but it's amazin' strange. Why, Danny was a fish fer red liquor. I guess he an' Gene had some pretty hard words, though I'm not sure about thet. Anyway, Gene went down to the railroad an' he got on an engine, an' he was in the engine when it pulled out. Lord, I hope he doesn't hold up the train! If he gets gay over in Arizona he'll go to the pen at Yuma. An' thet pen is a graveyard fer cowboys. I wired to agents along the railroad to look out fer Stewart, an' to <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> to me if he's located." ...|$|E

50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latch—they store bits {{in ordinary}} wire spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit.

5000|$|Active Electromagnetic Board — These {{interactive}} whiteboards feature {{an array}} of wires embedded behind the board surface interacts with a coil in the stylus tip to determine the (X,Y) coordinate of the stylus.

In other words, there are magnetic sensors in the board that react and send a message back to the computer when they are activated by a magnetic pen.|$|E

50|$|Placing {{spark plug}} <b>wires</b> <b>back</b> into their {{separators}} or holders during replacement helps {{to keep them}} in place despite engine vibration, extending their life. A common problem with spark plug wires is corrosion of the metal end terminals. Better-quality spark plug wires usually have brass terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.|$|R

Tom walks across the wire and stomps on it repeatedly, bouncing Jerry into his hands. He walks over the <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> to the ramp only to run into the irate elephant. She uses her weight to pull the wire {{and both of them}} {{all the way down to}} the ground. She suctions the mouse into her trunk and releases the cat, launching him out of the circus tent.|$|E

5000|$|The next day, Serch brings Jus Rhyme, $hamrock, and John Brown to {{the legendary}} Shelter in the {{basement}} of St. Andrews Hall, the inspiration for the film 8 Mile.

Similar to $hamrock, he also stumbled a bit, but he had some trouble getting in his punchlines over the crowd noise. John Brown got in the most punchlines but also got crushed the worst by Detroit rap legend Lo Louis from the Cardiboys. After deliberating with their opponents, Serch chooses to eliminate Jus Rhyme.

40|$|Part of the Grab and Go With Science series, in this {{activity}} youth will build and understand the dangers of a short circuit. There are times when electrical current tries to find a shortcut through the circuit.

This is a short circuit...|$|E
30|$|Careful {{attention}} {{during the}} drilling technique is of paramount importance. The drilling speed must be reduced immediately once {{the resistance of}} the opposite metaphyseal cortex is felt. The drilling is then continued at a low pace and stopped immediately at the point of appreciating loss of resistance to prevent overshooting of the wire. In this way, one can be sure of achieving a good purchase of the opposite cortex. Saline irrigation is done throughout the procedure to prevent thermal necrosis. Overprojecting into soft tissues would endanger the surrounding vital structures and pulling the <b>wire</b> <b>back</b> might compromise its purchase strength.|$|E
