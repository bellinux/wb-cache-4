40|$|Abstract The {{increasing}} energy demand, {{energy supply}} {{and climate change}} problems that the European Union (EU) is confronting, has caused it to consider renewable energy (RE) {{as a solution to}} these problems. The member state Portugal has therefore set targets to implement RE. An abundant RE in Portugal is wave energy (WE), however, due to its technical limitations, <b>WE</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet a mature technology. Moreover, there are also non-technical factors hampering the implementation of WE in Portugal. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify non-technical barriers hampering the implementation of WE in Portugal. Eliminating non-technical barriers leads to a well functioning technological innovation system (TIS) and allows creating a WE industry. This approach is used to understand the development and diffusion of WE in Portugal. A process/history event analysis is conducted, in order to trace the missing factors labelled as Functions of TIS. These functions are: entrepreneurial activities, knowledge development, knowledge diffusion through networks, guidance of the search, market formation, resource mobilisation, and advocacy coalitions. Furthermore, interactions between functions as a TIS matures are also considered. These are: the science and technology push, the entrepreneurial, system building and market motor. The TIS of WE for Portugal consist of all actors required for a well functioning TIS. However, this interaction is weak. Functions are being fulfilled, however, not as strong as it is required. The entrepreneurial motor has been identified, which shows that all functions need to be strengthened. In order to obtain a well functioning TIS, the success case of the Danish wind turbines was used as benchmark to learn key lessons. The main outcomes of this study were a list of specific policy implications for improving the performance of the TIS and general policy implications, which suggest that policies should be designed by combining innovation and transition policies...|$|E
