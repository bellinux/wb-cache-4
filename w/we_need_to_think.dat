The Peer Support Programme, funded by a Griffith University grant, was designed on principles of collaboration, adult learning and peer-assisted learning in a student community in order to counter the isolation that has been described as being endemic to the postgraduate experience. The purpose of the research was to assess the effectiveness of the peer support mechanism in terms {{of the degree to which}} it successfully embodied the principles on which it was based: peer-assisted learning in a student community, collaboration, and adult learning.

The court hearing finished on 17 September 2010, with the judges reserving their judgement until 5 November 2010. On that day Woolas {{was found to have}} breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 in relation to three of the four statements complained about, and the judges ruled that his election was void. Phil Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, stating that [...] "this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians." [...] and that it [...] "will inevitably chill political speech". He succeeded in overturning the finding in respect of one of the three statements but the main findings of the election court judgment were upheld. A by-election on 13 January 2011 resulted in the election of Debbie Abrahams (Labour).|$|E

Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music.

Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month.

Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that."

40|$|The term “postmodern ” {{has been}} used in many {{different}} ways by many different people. And that’s just fine with postmodernists. Those given credit for the creation of postmodernism cared little for the name, and today’s evangelizers feel no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pin it down to one meaning. That is the point, after all. Postmodernism was born as a reaction against the “modernist project ” of finding the one final answer to every question. The real world, postmodernists would say, is much more complex than that. But whether you consider yourself a postmodernist or not, you will find Mathematics Education within the Postmodern (edited by Margaret Walshaw, $ 34. 95) an eye-opening and thought-provoking book. As postmodern pioneer Valerie Walkerdine says in the preface, the purpose of this volume is to “challenge accepted wisdoms ” (p. vii) about mathematics, mathematics education, and mathematics educators. Up to now, “the post ” has led to few insights into mathematics education, even as its contribution to other disciplines has grown. 1 A volume such as this is a sign that this interesting perspective is growing in popularity and recognition, pulling up a seat at the table, and joining the fray. For those new to postmodernism, editor Walshaw provides a nice introduction in the first chapter, along with an explanation of modernism, for those who are not aware they are embedded in it. Accurately, though disturbingly, she describes the postmodern approach as “unsettling ” and about “exploring tentativeness ” (p. 3). There is an unapologetic lack of answers here: no “tips for teachers ” (p. 222), as Cotton says in the final chapter. This book, like this approach, is about opening up new ways of thinking about matters we did not realize <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about, things <b>we</b> though...|$|R
