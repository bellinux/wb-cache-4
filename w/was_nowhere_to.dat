5|$|Parachute: The {{earliest}} {{primitive form}} of the parachute was made some 4,000 {{years ago when the}} Chinese noticed that air resistance would slow a person's fall from a height. The Western Han Dynasty writer Sima Qian in his book Historical Records records the story of Shun, a legendary Chinese emperor who ran away from his murderous father by climbing onto the top of a high granary. As there <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> go, Shun grabbed two bamboo hats and leapt off the granary and glided downward to safety.|$|E
5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. The supporting British armour <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be seen and the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> {{be seen and}} the artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising {{the degree to which}} his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} December 30, the 4th South Vietnamese Marine Battalion {{moved out to}} Biên Hòa Air Base, waiting to be airlifted into the battlefield. The 1/4th Marine Battalion was the first unit to arrive on the {{outskirts}} of Bình Giã, but the 1st Company commander decided to secure the landing zone, to wait {{for the rest of the}} battalion to arrive instead of moving on to their objective. After the rest of the 4th Marine Battalion had arrived, they marched towards the Catholic church to relieve the besieged Rangers. About one and a half hours later, the 4th Marine Battalion linked up with the 30th, 33rd and 38th Ranger Battalions, as the Viet Cong began withdrawing to the northeast. That afternoon the 4th Marine Battalion recaptured the village, but the Viet Cong <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be seen, as all their units had withdrawn from the village during the previous night, linking with other Viet Cong elements in the forest to attack the government relief forces. On the evening of December 30, the Viet Cong returned to Bình Giã and attacked from the south-eastern perimeter of the village. The local villagers, who discovered the approaching Viet Cong, immediately sounded the alarm to alert the ARVN soldiers defending the village. The South Vietnamese were able to repel the Viet Cong, with support from U.S. Army helicopter gunships flown out from Vung Tau airbase.|$|E

By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain their pre-war status at the {{forefront}} of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by Dada, the cubists regrouped. Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées. Picasso <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.|$|E
25|$|The remote hilly Lan Xang proved most troublesome. He {{personally}} led the two-pronged {{invasion of}} Lan Xang in October 1569.

25|$|Following {{independence}} cricket remained {{very much}} a minority sport in Myanmar, and <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be seen between 1988 and 1995. In 2002 the game was seeing a resurgence, with a seven team league organised by former Bengal first class player Naresh Kumar, with some former first class players taking part in games attended by around 250 people. Cricket has also been featured on TV news reports. The Myanmar Cricket Federation received {{a visit from the}} ICC in 2004 and became an affiliate member of the organisation in 2006. The game is currently played primarily by ex-pats, but the game has recently been introduced into schools.|$|E

Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II.

25|$|DutchSouth African Ryan ten Doeschate {{hammered}} a career-best 89 not out as Essex Eagles powered {{their way}} to 273 for 6 at Chelmsford. His innings included five sixes and four fours, as Sajid Mahmood was the main recipient of his boundary-hitting - ending with figures of two for 67 in nine overs. England Under-19 player Tom Smith, who had taken 15 Test wickets in three U-19 matches with Sri Lanka, proved that the gap between Under-19 cricket and List A cricket is huge, as he finished with 42 off his five overs. When Lancashire Lightning batted, Darren Gough got an early wicket of Iain Sutcliffe, and despite scores in the 30s from Andrew Crook and Mal Loye, Lancashire lost their first four wickets for 91 runs. Andrew Symonds rebuilt with Mark Chilton, but once Symonds was bowled by Gough - who ended with four for 31 - there <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> hide for Lancashire. Kyle Hogg blitzed his way to 36, lifting Lancashire to 218, but they still suffered a comprehensive loss.|$|E

25|$|Until 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were {{conducted}} in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In January 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem made the Mount of Olives inaccessible, as the route to the cemetery passed through hostile Arab villages. The catalyst {{for the opening of}} Sanhedria Cemetery was the March 23, 1948 explosion of three British army trucks filled with kerosene on Ben Yehuda Street in downtown Jerusalem. The explosion collapsed the Atlantic Hotel and heavily damaged adjacent buildings. Forty-two Jewish men, women, and children were killed in the blast, but there <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> bury them. While the bodies lay in the courtyard of the Bikur Holim Hospital for five days, representatives of the Kehilat Yerushalayim chevra kadisha scoured the city for a suitable location for a new cemetery. An empty lot next to the Sanhedria neighborhood, in the vicinity of a government agricultural experiments station, was deemed appropriate, and permission was obtained from British Mandate authorities. The site was hastily consecrated by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ben-Zion Hai Uziel, and the bodies were buried on the fifth day in the presence of thousands.|$|E
25|$|They started positively, riding {{their luck}} and good favour with the umpires – {{a number of}} lbw appeals were turned down {{both before and after}} tea – as Strauss and Trescothick paired up for 80 for the first wicket before Strauss edged a classic pace-man's short-ball from Lee back into the bowler's waiting hands. Vaughan got nicely off the mark with a four with his second ball, however, {{suggesting}} that England would be playing positively to get the target – but Lee and Warne just kept pounding. Trescothick departed for 44, edging a straight ball from Warne to first slip – having taken him for ten in the previous over – and Bell was left hopelessly plumb to a ball that didn't turn. When Vaughan – who had failed to buy a run off the last 23 deliveries – was bowled comprehensively by Lee, there <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> hide for England, and not even an unbeaten 42 from Pietersen to see England to stumps could hide the inevitable – that England needed 301 for the last five wickets, with a world-class bowling attack at the other end.|$|E
25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E
