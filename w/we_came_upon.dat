500|$|In April 2000, filming {{began on}} the Michael Bay film Pearl Harbor. [...] Before the filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{gathered}} on the USS Arizona memorial for a wreath-laying by a representative of Touchstone Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay. The producers brought fifteen vintage planes to Ford Island, placing them in one hangar for the filming. In addition, they brought fifteen ships back to Pearl Harbor for live bombardment (without sinking them). [...] The operations room of the control tower was converted into a barracks for the filming. The Pacific Aviation Museum hoped that the film would increase public awareness of the tower and spur support for its restoration. Bay reflected on the historic significance of Ford Island: [...] "I have a vivid memory of showing the crew around Ford Island during pre-production. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a plaque directly across from the sunken Arizona, marking the spot where a torpedo hit nearly six decades ago. My crew stood in silence for three minutes at the sight of this small monument. It was a solemn moment for all of us, and I think it helped the crew appreciate the undertaking were [...] about to begin." [...] During filming, a Vultee BT-13 Valiant used as a torpedo bomber crashed on the island.|$|E
2500|$|The whites rode up {{the canyon}} in the afternoon. [...] "The first body <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> {{was that of}} a woman", remembered Platt. Army Dr. David Franklin Powell {{described}} the march up the battleground: [...] "We advanced {{from the mouth of the}} ravine to its head and found fifty-nine dead Pawnees ...". A number of the dead women lay naked. [...] "Although the Pawnees made a stand and fought through the day, over a hundred were wounded, killed, or raped and mutilated".|$|E
6000|$|... (M149) Then <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{an entry}} that records {{one of the}} deepest griefs of this stage of Mr. Gladstone’s life—the sudden death of Bishop Wilberforce:— ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be {{fifty yards}} from here," [...] said Cavor, with indecisive gestures. [...] "The {{only thing is}} to beat round about until <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here, sleepy-head,' said Joe, {{giving him}} the lantern. 'Carry this, and bring the dog, and that small cudgel of yours. And woe betide the fellow if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> him.' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the night before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the fleet, and were brought to by a hail from the guard-boat.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{she led the}} {{way through}} winding {{corridors}} until at a sudden turn <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> an opening which overlooked the Valley Dor.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> our destination, a great amphitheatre {{situated}} at the further edge of the plain, and {{about half a mile}} beyond the garden walls.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{a village}} of any size," [...] he said, [...] "we must avoid it. The main point is to capture a native, and find out exactly where we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now and then, to be sure, <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{something}} that makes us hesitate again whether, after all, Dryden was not grandiose rather than great, as in the two passages that next follow:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{some more}} McClintockian surprise--a {{sweetheart}} who is sprung upon us without any preparation, {{along with a}} name for her which is even {{a little more of}} a surprise than she herself is.|$|R
6000|$|... "After halting at Palel {{for some}} hours a start was made, at eleven o'clock at night; and at daybreak <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> some villages, each {{house in which}} was {{standing}} alone in a large enclosure, surrounded by a wall, ditch, and hedge. We went at them and carried them, one by one, without any great loss to ourselves. Issuing on the other side, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a plain about a thousand yards across. Beyond this was a bridge, on fire. The enemy were strongly posted in trenches and behind hedges.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps I {{have found}} his match; but you shall hear. Grimes said he heard guns, and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the scoundrel in Lewis Acre, two brace on his shoulder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About twelve miles northward of {{the little}} silver-mining town of Tubac <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> an Apache encampment. I at once {{discovered}} two white men among the Indians. These were the captive priests.|$|E
6000|$|... "Until Craig's father," [...] he admitted. [...] "I {{am afraid}} I {{must admit that}} <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> a bad piece of family history here. Silas Craig entered the service of my father in 1858, as under game-keeper. Here <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> the first black mark against the name. He appears to have lived reputably for some years, and then, after a quarrel with a {{neighbour}} about some trivial matter, he deliberately murdered him, a crime {{for which he was}} tried and executed in 1867. John Craig, his only son, entered our service in 1880, and, when I left England, accompanied me as my valet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon it won't be {{very long}} before <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> a Mexican village," [...] Harry said one day, {{after they had}} been six weeks on their {{downward}} course. [...] "I have heard there is one above the Grand Cañon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meaning {{that there}} is more of fear in your mind lest <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> spies of the enemy, than {{expectation}} Commodore Barney might need our services?" [...] I asked, and the old man finally admitted that perhaps such was the case.|$|R
60|$|Turning round a bold {{sweep of}} the beach, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a piece of fine, open ground, with a fisherman's {{dwelling}} in the distance, crowning a knoll which rolled off into the water.|$|E
60|$|It was night, however, before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> further {{traces of}} them,-- several fires {{where they had}} stopped to cook some food. As the sky was clear, we pushed on all that night.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> {{the fleet}} of law-breaking fishermen, each boat {{two or three}} hundred yards from its neighbors, and boats and nets dotting the river {{as far as we}} could see, Charley said: ...|$|E
5000|$|When we {{pass from}} the {{inorganic}} to the organic <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> {{a new set}} of laws - but the reason why the lower set do not seem to operate in the higher sphere is not that they are annhilated, but that they are overruled. (Drummond 1883, p. 405, quoted in Reid) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} we make it out to be," [...] Boston Joe said. [...] "We {{have the}} choice of either going up the Gila valley and {{mounting}} this side stream till <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> something that agrees with these four marks, or of keeping along from the west by a valley about the right distance from the Gila." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a fine gallop, old fellow," [...] Vincent said, patting it; [...] "and so have I. There's been nothing for you to lose your temper about, and the next road <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> <b>we</b> will turn your face homeward. Half a dozen lessons like this, and then, no doubt, we shall be good friends." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> {{a little}} clearing, {{where there was}} a rude log-cabin with a stone chimney. Skins of animals were tacked upon logs. Under the bank was a spring. The {{mountain}} overshadowed this wild nook.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on our}} {{way back}} that <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the dead rabbit. The red body of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs {{stripped}} white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It took us {{a quarter}} of an hour's search in the dark to find the rope; but at last <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> it, and sure enough there was only four or five fathoms in the water.|$|E
60|$|With Abel Hunt at liberty, roaming {{around the}} village seeking us out and most like {{counting}} to denounce us as rebels, {{it was in}} the highest degree dangerous for any member of our company to venture forth from the cabin lest <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> that fellow whom I doubted not was bent solely on doing us a harm.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is awkward, Mike. There {{is nothing}} for it, now, but to ride on, {{and when we}} have reached {{the foot of the}} {{mountains}} on the other side, strike across country until <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> the road running direct to Badajos. They are a good two miles behind us, so we need not blow our horses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will {{seize the}} woman first," [...] Jethro said, [...] "and {{then go out}} round the house and {{come down from the}} other way upon the chariot. The man will have heard the outcry; and if <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{suddenly}} out of the door, might leap into the chariot and drive off before we could overtake him. But if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> it from behind we shall secure him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The next day, {{late in the}} afternoon, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the Brilliant chasing some Spanish craft into Cartagena and, as we had Spanish colours up, {{she took}} us for one of them, and blazed away at us." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} a mile inland <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> the holluschickie—sleek young bulls, living out the {{loneliness}} of their bachelorhood and gathering strength against the day when they would fight their way into the ranks of the Benedicts.|$|E
60|$|We had {{proceeded}} for possibly an hour without serious interruption, and Thuvia {{had just}} {{whispered to me}} that we were approaching our first destination, when on entering a great chamber <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>upon</b> a man, evidently a thern.|$|E
60|$|Towards morning <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out <b>upon</b> an open plain, {{and left}} these evil prowlers {{of the night}} behind us.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use {{trying to}} make {{our way through the}} broken ground, Mike. There is another road that goes through Huerne. We will strike that, and must so get round on the right of the enemy. Even if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> them, <b>we</b> are not likely to excite suspicion, as we shall be on a road leading from Oudenarde.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall go {{straight}} on to Coimbra," [...] Terence said, [...] "unless <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>upon</b> a British force before that. Two long days' march {{will take us}} there. After that I must do as I am ordered; my independent command will {{come to an end}} there. I hope that I shall soon hear that my regiment has returned from England." ...|$|R
