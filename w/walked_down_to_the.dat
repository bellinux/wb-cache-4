Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression.

When a young girl came into his shop {{and asked if he}} had any taffy for sale, he is said to have offered some [...] "salt water taffy".
