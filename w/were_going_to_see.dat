500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so if you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, and then when {{it turns out to be}} Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{staff writer}} Al Jean {{commented on the}} episode: [...] "The idea of it to parody EC Comics was really {{original}} and kind of shocking for a cartoon on network television. [...] Jim Brooks said, 'We better have a disclaimer {{at the beginning of}} this Halloween show,' so Marge came out and warned people that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> something scary. And the funny thing is it's now very tame by our Halloween standards and by network animation standards." [...] According to M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television, the warning only made the episode more attractive to children. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film Frankenstein. While similar [...] "warnings" [...] were used to open the second and third [...] "Treehouse" [...] episodes, these quickly became a burden to write and there was no warning for the fourth episode. Instead, it had Marge ask Bart to warn people how frightening the show was during his introduction paying homage to Night Gallery. The tradition was revived for [...] "Treehouse of Horror V"; after that, they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them. In the opening segment of the episode, and the four subsequent episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous television season and celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison. They were last used in [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", which included a solitary tombstone with the words [...] "Amusing Tombstones" [...] to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Of the series, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the only one that included a treehouse as a setting. [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a theremin (an early electronic musical instrument), but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experiences}} of developing these engines {{can be summed}} up shortly by General Motors Research vice-president Charles Kettering: [...] "I do not recall any trouble with the dip stick." [...] Ralph Budd, accused of gambling on diesel power, chirped that [...] "I knew that the GM people <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the program through to the very end. Actually, I wasn't taking a gamble at all." [...] The manifestation of this gamble was the eight-cylinder Winton 8-201A diesel, a creature no larger than a small Dumpster, that powered the Burlington Zephyr (built 1934) on its record run and opened the door for developing the long line of diesel engines that has powered Electro-Motive locomotives for the past seventy years.|$|E

2500|$|As was the {{convention}} of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials {{in front of their}} surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if used at all. The Australians were all amateurs until the Packer Revolution, even though they played like professionals. In a dinner for the teams by the Australian Board of Control Hutton gave a speech asking when the Australian players <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some of the £100,000 the ABC had made from the 1953 tour of England [...] "You rich men get all the money – why don't the players get more?" [...] and asked [...] "Miller and Lindwall have done so much for Australian cricket – {{what are you going to}} do for them?" [...] and suggested they should have a benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Gene Simmons {{has made}} it clear that Criss was fired; Paul Stanley too has {{discussed}} Criss' departure in several interviews, including the commentary on [...] Ace Frehley in his 2011 book, No Regrets, also stated that Criss was fired during a band meeting in which Frehley was outvoted by Simmons and Stanley. A spoken word CD released in 1999 titled 13 Classic Kiss Stories, features Bill Aucoin (Kiss' first manager) where he also discusses Criss being [...] "let go". Criss, however, has maintained that he quit the band. The video for [...] "Shandi" [...] was shot in one day, and Peter was out of the band at that time; Stanley said of the shoot, [...] "We shot a video for the song 'Shandi' after the decision to let Peter go had been confirmed. He came to the video shoot knowing it was the last time he would appear with KISS. At the end of the day, he took his makeup case with him and left. It wasn't tearful, but it was a big moment. Peter was leaving. We had fired him, and this was the last time we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him in the band".|$|E
