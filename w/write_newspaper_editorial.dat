Donelson {{moved back to}} Nashville after Jackson's retirement the following year, where he helped Jackson sustain the Democratic party {{in a variety of}} ways for the next seven years.

In 1841, Donelson married another cousin, Elizabeth (Martin) Randolph, with whom he would have eight more children.

40|$|The {{workplace}} {{research of}} Sylvia Scribner provides a model {{with which to}} study relationships between socially and institutionally organized practices and individual cognitive processes {{as well as to}} explore relationships between practices and processes in writing and the teaching of writing. Observations and conversations in one inner-city, multi-ethnic middle school reveal how social, cultural, and institutional structures influence assignments and peer conferences. For example, "problem-solution" essays frequently required of eighth grade students represent a variant-of a genre expected in the state (California) competency requirements; however, no effort is made by teachers to connect these assignments to social practices outside school, such as <b>writing</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials.</b> Consequently, when asking the question "Does writing as process = writing as social practice?

2500|$|Since 2003, Anderson {{has been}} known for his {{opposition}} to the introduction of slot machines in Annapolis. [...] Delegate Anderson organized protests against slots, <b>wrote</b> <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> [...] and took to the airwaves at several local radio and television stations to solidify opposition to bringing organized gambling into Maryland. In spite of strong support for slots by then Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich, Anderson and his colleagues prevailed and a pro-slots bill never made it out of the House of Delegates though similar bills had passed the State Senate. In 2005, however, both chambers passed different pro-slots bills. In the House of Delegates the measure passed by a 71–66 vote. In 2007 [...] new Governor, Martin O'Malley, hinted at some marginal support for slots as a possible new revenue source. Although Anderson and O'Malley share party affiliations, Anderson remained a staunch opponent of bringing slots into Maryland.|$|R

[...] The editorial was in response to the notorious church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama which killed four black girls, all under the age of 15. He was once approached by the FBI, who wanted him to write an article about Martin Luther King Jrs alleged infidelities which they had uncovered through wiretaps.

The editorial said Addis Neger believed that the fundamental journalistic ideal was truth and journalists could not reach the truth by splitting the difference or giving equal lines to competing claims. Addis Neger professed to follow rigorous social science methods in investigating issues. [...] "What differentiates our approach from academic works is not methodology," [...] the paper declared. [...] "It is writing style and presentation. We believe journalists are social scientists. No social scientist worthy of his profession reaches conclusions by balancing competing claims."

40|$|An asset {{allocation}} recommendation {{depends on the}} market forecasts and the individual characteristics of the investor. The existing scientific literature is focused on market forecasts, while the investor profile is shortly depicted, usually resorting to a hypothetical one, for instance identified by adjectives such as conservative, moderate, aggressive. On the contrary, we take a richer picture of the investor profile, because we think that only a tailor made advice can really add value for the clients. Our dataset is composed by 420 advice, issued by 135 money managers and professionals during a 5 years period, from 1998 to 2003, in the most important Italian financial newspaper (Il Sole 24 Ore) {{for the benefit of}} individual investors who had <b>written</b> the <b>newspaper’s</b> <b>editorial</b> office giving a rich description of their personal profile. About 30 % of the advisors are not Italian ones working for international securities brokers and investment banks. Our study contributes to understand how advisors transfer the investor’s characteristics into the investment process. Even though we found some results contradicting the well known normative models, such as the CAPM, we think that many properties of the {{asset allocation}} proposals are consistent with the purpose to issue tailor made advice which are not too far from optimizing targets. Some drawbacks come out as well: for instance the importance of the investor’s borrowing is overlooked. Moreover the relationship between home bias, that is the overweight of the domestic stocks, and the investor’s profile looks inconsistent with the principle of acting as professionals who try to reconcile the normative rules, optimizing from a theoretical point of view, but unacceptable and not well understood by the client, with the behavior of individual investor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> {{constitute}} {{a part of}} media discourse, which is an extremely important field of research in intercultural rhetoric analysis. The interface between the linguistic analysis of <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> and teaching of English as a foreign/second language is also a relevant issue in language teaching. Thus, drawing on the theory of inter-cultural rhetoric analysis and considering {{the important role of}} <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> in shaping public opinions, the present study aimed at conducting a genre-specific analysis of <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> culled from the editorials of the English newspaper, The New York Times, and those of Persian newspaper, Tehran Times. Addressing different discourse strategies that <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> employ for propagating their preferred ideologies, the study specifically focused on the schematic analysis of the editorials and also the types of the rhetorical structures they employed for communicating their intended opinions. The findings of the study revealed that the editorials in the two papers were similar in having the same schematic structures and moves. However they were found to be different in terms of realizing the moves. Furthermore, the editorial writers in the two papers, throughout the headlines and the main texts, tried to influence their readers' understanding of the news events by employing certain textual and rhetorical devices. The study has also offered some pedagogical implications of the findings that might provide the ESL/EFL teachers and students with the required knowledge on the discourse conventions in a certain sub-genre namely <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> making them ready to use the <b>newspaper</b> <b>editorials</b> in the classrooms...|$|R
