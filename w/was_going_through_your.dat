5000|$|This role {{involves}} {{developing a}} list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting. Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be open questions. A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task. Questions that a student might ask could be: [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind when you read this passage?" [...] or [...] "How did the main character change {{as a result of this}} incident?" ...|$|E

6000|$|At half-past seven Silverbridge was at {{the door}} in Brook Street. Yes; Miss Boncassen was at home. The servant {{thought that she was}} upstairs dressing. Then Silverbridge made his way without further {{invitation}} into the drawing-room. There he remained alone for ten minutes. At last the door opened, and Mrs. Boncassen entered. [...] "Dear Lord Silverbridge, who ever dreamed of seeing you? I thought all you Parliament gentlemen <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> ceremonies. Isabel had a ticket and went down, and saw your father." ...|$|R

You could <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> free agency, {{but when}} that happens {{a lot of stuff}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> mind. That feeling is no longer there. You’re settled in with a great team, a team I love playing for. I know the {{coaching}} staff. I’m looking forward to getting back in it and moving forward." [...] “I’m glad I don’t have any of those free agency jitters to deal with. It’s settled, we’re done and we’re moving on. The contract is behind you - you just have to make sure you’re out there on the field and being a leader out there.” ...|$|R

6000|$|Can you not see, poor misguided [...] "fellow citizens," [...] how you permit your {{political}} taskmasters to forge leg-chains of your follies and load you down with them? Will nothing teach you {{that all this}} fuss-and-feathers, all this ceremony, all this official gorgeousness and brass-banding, this [...] "manifestation of a proper respect for the nation's head" [...] has no decent place in American life and American politics? Will no experience open your stupid eyes {{to the fact that}} these shows are but absurd imitations of royalty, to hold you silly while you are plundered by the managers of the performance?--that while you toss your greasy caps in air and sustain them by the ascending current of your senseless hurrahs the programmers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> blessed pockets and exploiting your holy dollars? No; you feel secure; [...] "power is of the People," [...] and you can effect a change of robbers every four years. Inestimable privilege--to pull off the glutted leech and attach the lean one! And you can not even choose among the lean leeches, but must accept those designated by the programmers and showmen who have the reptiles on tap! But then you are not [...] "subjects;" [...] you are [...] "citizens"--there is much in that Your tyrant is not a [...] "King;" [...] he is a [...] "President." [...] He does not occupy a [...] "throne," [...] but a [...] "chair." [...] He does not succeed to it by inheritance; he is pitchforked into it by the boss.

A press release describes the song as being [...] "written with affection about her childhood memories {{and based on the}} premise that no matter where you are or what you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> in <b>your</b> life, you can always go Home." [...] It is notable for a bursting refrain reminiscent of the achingly climactic verse heard in Simon and Garfunkel's signature tune [...] "Homeward Bound." [...] The lyrics hint at Jackson's exile from the family in the early 1990s when she was under the control of abusive manager Jack Gordon. Jackson expresses remorse over the [...] "many years that we let pass" [...] having been [...] "parted by the fame we grew to only know." [...] The song alludes also to La Toya's affectionate pet name for Michael, [...] "Joker." ...|$|R

[...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> in <b>your</b> music", she said. [...] "he {{only thing you can}} really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> called Love?. She would tell KIIS FM's DJ Skee that she had chosen to call her album Love? because love was something that still confused her. [...] "Love is the most confusing thing in the world, that's why the album is called Love with a question mark." [...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|R

6000|$|We have at last {{authentic}} {{news from}} the interior. A letter has arrived from the prisoners, dated Dec. 15th (I can hardly understand how, at the Shoho rate of travelling, it can have come so fast), in which they report that the King of Shoa, who was besieging Magdala, and upon whose assistance Colonel Merewether had built much, has retired from before the place, {{and that it is}} now open to Theodore. This is certainly bad news. Not that I have ever put the smallest trust in the assistance of any of these kinglings. On the contrary, I think that the policy which has been hitherto pursued with respect to the natives has been a mistake. We should have never asked for alliance or friendship. We are perfectly strong enough to go on by ourselves, and were we not it is certain that we could place no reliance upon any professions of friendship. Why, then, make the natives think we are weak by asking for allies? Say firmly to each king, “We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on <b>through</b> <b>your</b> country to fetch the prisoners beyond. We are perfectly strong enough to do this, and anything beside which may be necessary. We go through and return without making any stay. In your country are many kings and many rivals. We need no assistance, and we know that if we enter into alliance with one chief we gain the enmity of another by so doing. We wish not, therefore, to enter into any alliance whatever. We are friends passing <b>through</b> <b>your</b> country. We require stores, cattle, &c., and we mean to have them; but we pay for everything we require, and that at prices which the imagination of the herd-and flock-owner of Abyssinia never before conceived even in his wildest dreams.” ...|$|R

Marc Anthony helped me so much because {{he was the one who}} was like, 'You have a beautiful voice,' I think people are gonna be surprised with some of the vocals on this album. It have urbanny-type tracks on it. Don't worry. Booty shakers, mid-tempos, feel-good records."
