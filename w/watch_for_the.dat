5|$|On September 16, 44hours before Hurricane Isabel made {{landfall}} on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire coastline of Delaware. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coastline. On September 17, 26hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings. While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155miles (250km) south-southeast of Lewes as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane. Though located within the cone of uncertainty, all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing {{to the west of}} the state.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00UTC on August5, the CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island of Hawaii; forecasts issued by the NHC as early as August2 illustrated the possibility of Iselle tracking over or {{in the vicinity of}} the Hawaiian archipelago. As the hurricane tracked closer to the islands, watches were extended as far westward as Oahu. The first hurricane warning associated with Iselle was issued on August6 for Hawaii County. Later that day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Oahu. By early on August7, the tropical storm warning was extended to include Kauai, placing all of the main Hawaiian islands under some form of tropical cyclone warning. The potential for flooding also resulted in the issuance of a flash flood <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entirety the island chain. By August9, all warnings were lifted as Iselle no longer posed a threat to the islands.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire state of Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E

5|$|On November20, {{shortly before}} the {{tropical}} depression intensified into a tropical storm, the government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for the Swan Islands, along with a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> northwestern Honduran coastline. The advisories were discontinued within 10hours of Keith's passage through the region. The government of Belize briefly declared a tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole coastline of the country, but {{when it became clear}} that Keith posed little threat, the watch was canceled. About 16hours before the storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for much of the coastline of Quintana Roo. Six hours later, a tropical storm warning replaced the watch, and it was extended west to Progreso, Yucatán; a hurricane watch was also posted. Cuban officials issued a bulletin on the night of November20, advising that tropical storm conditions would spread over the west part of Cuba. A subsequent bulletin indicated the possibility for hurricane conditions, but as the storm continued further to the northwest, the threat diminished.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Alex making landfall, the Brownsville, Texas National Weather Service {{issued a}} flood <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> southernmost {{region of the}} state. The storm was {{expected}} to produce heavy rainfall for up to 18hours, which {{had the potential to}} cause significant flooding in poor drainage areas, especially those flooded by Hurricane Dolly in 2008. Officials opened hurricane shelters, and voluntary evacuations were put into place for South Padre Island; at least 1,000 people sought shelter in Cameron and Hidalgo counties.|$|E

This was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th, 13 ½ hours before Charley made landfall. Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000citizens and 159,000animals {{in the area of the}} expected impact. An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas.

Later that day, all warnings were canceled since the storm had further weakened to a tropical depression. On August8, after Arlene regenerated, residents in Bermuda were advised to not venture offshore on any vessel and rush all hurricane preparations to completion.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E
