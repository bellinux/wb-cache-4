25|$|The {{traveling}} salesman {{problem is}} {{what is called a}} conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices {{to come up with the}} one with the lowest total distance. However, let's assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.|$|E

Critics noted that the album was darker and more keyboard-focused than the band's debut. , an EP featuring remixes of three tracks from Free, {{was released}} on October 24, 2006. The band were keen to tour in support of Free, but no live shows materialised.

500|$|The {{film has}} been criticized for its {{portrayal}} of ballet and ballet dancers. Upon the film's release in the United Kingdom, The Guardian interviewed four professional ballet dancers in the UK: Tamara Rojo, Lauren Cuthbertson, Edward Watson, and Elena Glurjidze. Rojo called the film [...] "lazy... featuring every ballet cliche going." [...] Watson felt that the film [...] "makes [...] look so naff and laughable. It doesn't show why ballet is so important to us – why <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to try so hard." [...] The Canadian Press also reported that many Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Gillian Murphy a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre praised the visual elements of the film but noted that the film presentation of the ballet world was [...] "extreme." ...|$|E

However, after the death of Pope John Paul in 2005, Paisley expressed sympathy for Catholics, saying [...] "We can understand how Roman Catholics feel at the death of the Pope and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> in no way to interfere with their expression of sorrow and grief at this time." ...|$|E

Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge's success or failure six months after its introduction – brought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On 25 February 2003 Livingstone stated, [...] "I can't conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary" [...] referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that £5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.|$|E
2500|$|Harmonix {{announced}} that the initial run of regular DLC releases would end on April 2, 2013, as the company began to transition to other projects for next-generation consoles. The final song released on its regular download release schedule was the Don McLean song [...] "American Pie". The company did not rule out future DLC releases, and starting in January 2015, provided one-off releases of new content for the series. While Harmonix has not committed to a future Rock Band title, Rigopoulos has stated that reuse of existing downloadable content on future titles for next-generation consoles will be a priority, stating [...] "that investment that players have made {{over the years in}} those libraries is something that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to take great pains to protect".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{struggled}} with Yorke's change of direction. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood {{was concerned that}} the album [...] "might appear too gratuitous a move towards electronica and random digital experimentation." [...] His brother Colin feared [...] "some awful art-rock nonsense just {{for its own sake}} so that it looks like you're cutting your nose off to spite your face." [...] According to Yorke, Godrich [...] "didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to do something else. But {{at the same time he}} trusted me to have an idea of what I wanted." [...] The band had to accept that not every member would play on every song, which caused conflict. O'Brien said: [...] "It's scary— everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums." ...|$|E

Resigning from Boots, he bought this first shop. Over the next decade, Aggarwal built up a chain of six pharmacies, and a significant business, in and around Cardiff. In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award. He believes the key to good business is in customer service, telling Pharmacy Business (9 March 2011): [...] "I enjoy what I do. I have a lot of happiness in what we achieve. I've always had a strong head for business and I enjoy leadership and keeping customer service levels high. We want to make customers feel how <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{integration}} of FBO into the new RKO Radio Pictures in 1929, Marcus became the executive vice-president for the new company. He, along with Joseph I. Schnitzer and William LeBaron, were the triumvirate which ran the new company. In February, Marcus announced that the new RCA Photophone process of sound on film was the direction the studio would go in, rather than the alternative of sound on disc. He stated, [...] "Our synthesis of sound to action is all that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> in accuracy, and certainly the exhibitor's projection and sound problem is, to our mind, a much simplified one with sound-on-film." [...] With sound films becoming the norm, Marcus announced that RKO would still produce 40–50 per cent of their sound films with silent versions as well in 1929. Later in 1929 Marcus {{was one of the}} film executives on a committee representing film distributors in their negotiations with exhibition houses in trying to iron out a deal regarding splitting the revenue from movie showings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{little that}} Blanshard wrote on {{political}} theory (mainly in Reason and Goodness) owed much to Green and Bosanquet. These two philosophers, he held, had rescued Jean-Jacques Rousseau's confused {{doctrine of the}} general will {{and placed it on}} a rationally-defensible footing. Our [...] "real will" [...] (in Bosanquet's terms) or [...] "rational will" [...] (in Blanshard's) is simply that which <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want,</b> all things considered, if our reflections upon what we presently desire were pursued to their ideal limit. Blanshard argued that there is excellent reason to regard this [...] "ideal" [...] will as in fact real, and contended that it provided the foundation for a rational political theory. The state is justified if, and precisely insofar as, it helps individual human beings to pursue and achieve the common end which is the object of their rational will. He did not develop this doctrine to the point of advocating any specific form of political organization or social structure. In his Schilpp autobiography, he admitted to an early sympathy for socialism and to having voted the [...] "straight Democratic ticket" [...] over the previous 40-odd years.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E
