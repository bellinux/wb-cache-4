These alternative measures enrich the results of diagnostic fuzzy models and facilitate the experts’ task in decision-making. An application to a set of firms to verify the results is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows the basis of OWA operators to design a methodology to reduce the map of causes of business failure into monitoring key areas. Findings: The present paper introduces two alternative measures to test the proposal of grouping. In the empirical application, the superiority of the minimum T-norm over other decision rules is verified. The ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> (OWAD) goodness index predicts a better adjustment over the index built using OWA and Hamming distance measures. Practical implications: A useful mechanism to reduce the map of causes or diseases detected in key areas is added through this analysis. At the same time, these key areas can be disaggregated once some alert indicator is identified; this allows knowing the causes that require special attention. This application of OWA can encourage the development of suitable computer systems for monitoring the firm’s problems, alerting regarding failures and easing decision-making. Originality/value: A comparison of grouping causes into key areas through a goodness index based on Hamming distance and OWAD is proposed.

One issue is how to address projects inaugurated under the Gaddafi government, such as the terminal extension at Tripoli International Airport. Additionally, the state-owned Afriqiyah Airlines had been establishing a niche hub in Tripoli before the 2011 war, but this development has subsequently been stalled. Against this background, we analyse the prospects of an air transport hub operation in Libya, focusing on traffic between Africa and Europe, from a bird’s-eye economic–geographic view. First, a literature review is undertaken to identify general success factors for air transport hubs. Second, a <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> penalty (WADP) indicator is developed and applied to Tripoli as a potential hub location.

40|$|Abstract. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are {{one kind}} of non-coding RNA which play many {{important}} roles in eukaryotic cell. Investigations on miRNAs show that miRNAs are involved in cancer development in animal body. In this article, a threshold based method to check the condition (normal or cancer) of miRNAs of a given sample/patient, using <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between the normal and cancer miRNA expressions, is proposed. For each miRNA, the city block distance between two representatives, corresponding to scaled normal and cancer expressions, is obtained. The average of all such distances for different miRNAs is weighted by a factor, to generate the threshold. The weight factor, which is cancer dependent, is determined through an exhaustive search by maximizing the F score during training. In {{a part of the}} investigation, a ranking algorithm for cancer specific miRNAs is also discussed. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and by plotting points (1 −Specificity vs. Sensitivity) in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space, besides the F score.

Research has shown that timetable properties affect punctuality, and timetables can be changed relatively quickly and easily, compared to infrastructure and rolling stock. In this paper we study some strategies for assigning margins in timetables, and how they affect punctuality. The aim is to identify changes that can improve the punctuality of passenger trains. The study is based on a dataset containing detailed timetables and records of train movements for all trains in Sweden during the year of 2015, over 1. 1 million departures.

From these results we propose a package of changes to timetable planning which we estimate would improve overall punctuality by up to five percentage points...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distance}} {{dependence of}} electron–nuclear dipole–dipole coupling {{was tested using}} a series of poly-L-proline based peptides of different length. The poly-proline based peptides were synthesized with a nitroxide spin label on the N-terminus and a tryptophan on the C-terminus, and paramagnetic enhancements of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates were measured for the aromatic protons on the tryptophan {{as a function of}} the number of proline spacers in the sequence. As expected, paramagnetic enhancements decrease with distance, but the distances deduced from the NMR relaxation rates were shorter than expected for every peptide studied compared to a rigid linear poly-L-proline type II helix structure. Calculations of cross-relaxation rates indicate that this difference is not the result of spin-diffusion or the creation of a spin-temperature gradient in the proton spins caused by the nitroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to estimate dynamically averaged value of 〈r− 3 〉 2. These weighted average distances were close to the experimentally determined distances, and suggest that molecular motion may account for differences between the rigid linear models and the distances implied by the NMR relaxation data. A poly-L-prolone peptide synthesized with a central glycine hinge showed dramatic relaxation rate enhancements compared to the peptide of the same length lacking the hinge. Molecular dynamics simulations for the hinged peptide support the notion that the NMR data is a representation of the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>distance,</b> which in this case is much shorter than that expected for an extended conformation. These results demonstrate that intermoment distances based on NMR relaxation rates provide a sensitive indicator of intramolecular motions...|$|E

(The GAP is a 0 - 1 programming model {{in which it is}} desired to minimize the cost of assigning n tasks to a subset of m agents.

The facility location models considered are divided into public and private sector models. In the public sector, both p-median and capacity constrained p-median problems are treated (In the p-median problem exactly p of n sites must be selected to provide service to all n. Each site has an associated weight, e. g., its population, and it is desired to minimize the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between the n sites and their respective service sites.

By fitting the appropriate isochrones to the observed sequences of the clusters in five different color [...] magnitude diagrams, the <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> of <b>distance</b> moduli and heliocentric distances ((V_ 0 [...] M_V), d(kpc)) are (1190 ± 006, 2. 4 ± 0. 06) for Be 89, (958 ± 007, 0. 81 ± 0. 03) for Ru 135, and (1116 ± 006, 1. 7 ± 0. 05) for Be 10, and the <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> {{of the ages}} ((A), A(Gyr)) are (9. 58 ± 0. 06, 3. 8 ± 0. 6) for Be 89, (9. 58 ± 0. 06, 3. 8 ± 0. 7) for Ru 135, and (9. 06 ± 0. 05, 1. 08 ± 0. 08) for Be 10.

40|$|RADIOCHExtended X-ray {{absorption}} {{fine structure}} (EXAFS) has been utilized {{to investigate the}} local atomic structure around Th, U, and Pu atoms in polycrystalline mixed dioxides Th 1 -xMxO 2 (with M = U, Pu) for x ranging from 0 to 1. The composition dependence of the two first-coordination-shell distances was measured throughout the entire composition range for both solid solutions. The first-shell distances vary slightly across the solid-solution composition with values close {{to those of the}} pure dioxide parents, indicating a bimodal cation-oxygen distribution. In contrast, the second-shell distance varies strongly with composition, with values close to the <b>weighted</b> amount <b>average</b> <b>distances.</b> Nevertheless, in both systems, the lattice cell parameters, deduced from the first- and second-shell bond determined by EXAFS, are very close to those measured from X-ray diffraction (XRD). They vary linearly with composition, accurately following Vegard's law...|$|R
40|$|Basically the Exponentially <b>Weighted</b> Moving <b>Average</b> (EWMA) charts were {{introduced}} for monitoring the process mean in 1959 by Robert. It is much sensitive in detecting small shifts of mean than Shewhart charts. But lately {{it was felt}} that monitoring process mean was not enough in some cases. Then it was essential to introduce EWMA chart for monitoring sample variance and such a chart was introduced by Chen and Gan in 1993. These both EWMA charts can be used to monitor process mean and variance independently. But later it was identified monitoring mean and variance is a bivariate problem. In this series Exponentially <b>Weighted</b> Moving <b>Average</b> <b>Distance</b> square scheme (EWMAD 2) was introduced with the claim that the control limits of the schemes are independent of sample size. In this research project the effect of sample size in EWMAD 2 scheme is analyzed with the simulated samples with the different sample size and Average Run Lengths. In conclusion it is proved that EWMAD 2 scheme is independent of sample size in determining the control limits...|$|R
