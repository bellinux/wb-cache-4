5|$|Following {{the release}} of their 1969 debut, the Allman Brothers Band toured the United States {{extensively}} to promote the album, which had little commercial success. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth exposure that extended to more famous musicians, such as Eric Clapton, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> group leader Duane Allman to contribute to his 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.|$|E

5|$|Ford's {{first step}} into {{organised}} team football came with local Swansea based side Tower United, joining the club {{at the age}} of 15 as a full-back. Despite his young age, he played for the senior men's side in local amateur leagues where he attracted scouts from several clubs. The scouts included Albert Lindon of Arsenal, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Ford and teammate Frank Davies to attend a trial in Cardiff. Ford impressed enough to be offered an amateur contract with the London-based side, which was initially to be withheld until the end of hostilities in the Second World War. However, Ford himself rejected the contract as he felt he was too young too move away from his home and family.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Merrick to be examined and photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, Szilard {{moved to}} New York City, taking {{a room at}} the King's Crown Hotel near Columbia University. He {{encountered}} John R. Dunning, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That month, Niels Bohr brought news to New York of the discovery of nuclear fission in Germany by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction.|$|E

5|$|Sir William Sterndale Bennett (13 April 18161 February 1875) was an English composer, pianist, {{conductor}} {{and music}} educator. At {{the age of}} ten Bennett {{was admitted to the}} London Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he remained for ten years. By the age of twenty, he had begun to make a reputation as a concert pianist, and his compositions received high praise. Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer Felix Mendelssohn, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to Leipzig. There Bennett became friendly with Robert Schumann, who shared Mendelssohn's admiration for his compositions. Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|The KPD {{meeting in}} Berlin {{was held in}} secret. Fellow party members urged him to {{continue}} his studies in another country. He went into hiding for five months in the apartment of a fellow party member. In August 1933, he attended an anti-fascist conference in Paris chaired by Henri Barbusse, where he met an English couple, Ronald and Jessie Gunn, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Fuchs to stay with them in Clapton, Somerset. He was expelled from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in October 1933.|$|E
5|$|The {{first task}} which Qutayba set himself was the {{suppression}} of the rebellion in Lower Tokharistan, which was accomplished swiftly with the reconquest of Balkh. Qutayba then secured the submission of the local princes in the upper Oxus valley, most notably of Tish, king of al-Saghaniyan, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Qutayba to aid him in his dispute with the ruler of nearby Akharun (or Akhrun) and Shuman, in the northern mountainous districts of Tokharistan. After extensive negotiations led by Sulaym the Persian, the tarkhan Nizak, ruler of the Hephthalite principality of Badghis, surrendered to Qutayba, and pledged to accompany him in his expeditions.|$|E

5|$|When he was 24, {{his work}} with the United States Navy {{involved}} going to Australia and he deserted again, this time in Melbourne. There, he met Charlie Peters, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to his home to have a meal with his family including Jessie, Peters' 23-year-old daughter. Jessie and Jenner married a year later, on 6 July 1929, at HMAS Cerberus. They continued to live in Melbourne after their wedding and Jenner joined the Royal Australian Navy. He soon {{became one of the}} sailors assigned to travel to England to retrieve HMAS Canberra. He was serving on HMAS Australia in 1937 when he was legally discharged from the navy, buying his way out but not receiving a pension.|$|E
5|$|After Italy, Hungary was {{the first}} European country where the renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came {{directly}} from Italy during the Quattrocento to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks {{to the development of}} early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E

5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{trained by}} his mother, Kerry enjoyed success in {{swimming}} and surf lifesaving as a teenager. His swimming career progressed to senior Australian standards after {{he switched to}} the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to Queensland. He made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships and promptly won the 200m freestyle and backstroke events to win selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{at the age of}} 16. At the Olympics, Kerry reached the final in two events, coming seventh and fifth in the 100m and 200m backstroke respectively. Kerry was disappointed with his performances, but they attracted the attention of American coach Doc Counsilman, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Kerry to swim under him at the Indiana University. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, but his international career hit trouble when he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaking a curfew.|$|E
5|$|Kerry was {{disappointed}} with his performances, {{feeling that he}} had failed to perform to his potential amid the pressure and excitement of an Olympics. However, he felt that his experience of racing against the likes of Naber and Roland Matthes would hold him in good stead. On a brighter note, Kerry's performances impressed the leading American coach Doc Counsilman, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to come and swim at Indiana University after Kerry finished his secondary schooling in Australia. Kerry successfully defended his 200m backstroke national title in 1977, but the time was more than four seconds slower than his effort in the previous year. He combined with his New South Wales teammates to win all three relays, again in times substantially slower than in the preceding Olympic year. The performances earned him selection for the Australian team for the Coca-Cola Meet in London, but Kerry felt that he lacked motivation after the Olympics. Upon returning, he decided to absent himself from such events.|$|E

5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Front Mission 3, the third {{game of the}} main series and the fifth game of the total series, was {{composed}} by Koji Hayama and Hayato Matsuo, with one track contributed by Shigeki. Matsuo handled the orchestral pieces, while Hayama worked on the techno ones. The pieces were performed with synthesizers that were designed to sound like higher-quality versions {{of the types of}} sounds used in the original Front Mission, rather than sounding more like the actual instruments they represented. Hayama worked for Square as an in-house composer prior to the game, and was the one <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Matsuo, who was an independent composer, to meet the sound team and work on the game. An album of music from the game, titled Front Mission 3 Original Soundtrack, was released by DigiCube on September 22, 1999. The two-disc album has 47 tracks, is 2:30:00 long, and has a catalog number of SSCX-10035.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in {{the fact that he had}} returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{he began}} his comedy career by {{following}} up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) {{to go to the}} library and borrow books on how to write jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs {{over the next few years}} in Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, <b>who</b> <b>invited</b> Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E

5000|$|Dawah is an {{important}} Islamic concept which denotes the preaching of Islam. Da‘wah literally means [...] "issuing a summons" [...] or [...] "making an invitation". A Muslim who practices da‘wah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a dā‘ī, plural du‘āt. A dā‘ī is thus a person <b>who</b> <b>invites</b> people to understand Islam through a dialogical process, and may be categorized in some cases as the Islamic equivalent of a missionary, as one <b>who</b> <b>invites</b> people to the faith, to the prayer, or to Islamic life.|$|R
