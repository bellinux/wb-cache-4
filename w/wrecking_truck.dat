5000|$|On 27 March 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in the recorded history of North America struck South-Central Alaska. Tsunamis devastated Valdez, Seward and Kodiak. Gaping fissures, crumbled buildings and burst pipes dotted Anchorage. In the immediate aftermath, Major James Rowe arrived at Kulis from the airport, reporting that its control tower had been demolished. Two Air Guard members sped {{over with a}} <b>wrecking</b> <b>truck,</b> which they used to free three men trapped in the rubble. Rowe, meanwhile, started the engines of a C-123 and went aloft, serving as an emergency control tower and relaying what he could see {{to the rest of}} the world.Within 20 minutes after the quake ended, the Anchorage Times reported, Guard members began streaming into Kulis without being called. Personnel from the Motor Vehicle Section supplied electricity using emergency power units. Maintenance Squadron members took emergency steps to bring heat to strategic buildings, and the dispensary was prepared by medical technicians. A warehouse on base was converted to a shelter for civilians rendered homeless by the quake, with a makeshift dining hall and over 100 beds. By midnight, 97 of those beds were occupied. Over the next few weeks the 144th would fly 131,000 pounds of cargo and 201 passengers in support of earthquake relief efforts ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Red Throne" [...] {{was written}} by Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone. A {{separate}} group of writers– Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto– {{came up with the}} idea for the episode, which Kim and Xayaphone then adapted into a storyboard. Employing other crew members, background artist Derek Ballard depicted a derelict van, a <b>wrecked</b> <b>truck,</b> and ruined musical instruments in one piece for the episode. This was inspired by his growing up in the desert of Utah. Since he himself was in a band, he would often let other bands temporarily stay at his house during their tours, often taking them to auto shops due to their vans and campers breaking down.|$|R
50|$|A panicked Miles {{suggests}} the FBI and his police unit use the heroin as bait in a sting. He arranges {{to be with}} the heroin in the delivery truck, but is soon joined by Tulley (who he secretly set free from holding) and Deacon. During the drug deal, Deacon tries to expose Miles as a cop to the drug runners. While Miles and Tulley attempt to distract the dealers, the police and FBI raid the deal. Deacon escapes with the diamond in an armored truck and the police and FBI follow as he approaches the border with Mexico. The police and FBI are forced to halt their pursuit at the border, but Miles steals a patrol car and continues after Deacon. Miles forces Deacon to <b>wreck</b> the <b>truck</b> and then offers him a deal: Deacon gives Miles the diamond and allows Miles to arrest him and in exchange Miles takes him back to the United States and cuts him back in on the diamond. Deacon agrees, and Miles immediately double-crosses him by handcuffing him to the <b>wrecked</b> <b>truck</b> for the Federales to find. Deacon draws a gun to shoot Miles but Miles turns and shoots him first, killing him and avenging Eddie's death.|$|R

60|$|The train drew up at last. She did {{not know}} where George lodged, and {{would have to go to}} his hospital. She planned to get there at half past nine, and having eaten a sort of breakfast at the station, went forth into the town. The seaside was still wrapped in the early glamour which haunts chalk of a bright morning. But the streets were very much alive. Here was real {{business}} of the war. She passed houses which had been <b>wrecked.</b> <b>Trucks</b> clanged and shunted, great lorries rumbled smoothly by. Sea--and Air-planes were moving like great birds far up in the bright haze, and khaki was everywhere. But it was the sea Noel wanted. She made her way westward to a little beach; and, sitting down on a stone, opened her arms to catch the sun on her face and chest. The tide was nearly up, with the wavelets of a blue bright sea. The great fact, the greatest fact in the world, except the sun; vast and free, making everything human seem small and transitory! It did her good, like a tranquillising friend. The sea might be cruel and terrible, awful things it could do, and awful things were being done on it; but its wide level line, its never-ending song, its sane savour, were the best medicine she could possibly have taken. She rubbed the Shelly sand between her fingers in absurd ecstasy; took off her shoes and stockings, paddled, and sat drying her legs in the sun.|$|R
