6000|$|The {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} nature of Life, which have fallen within my knowledge, presuppose the arbitrary division of all that surrounds us into things with life, and things without life—a division grounded on a mere assumption. At the best, it can be regarded only as a hasty deduction from the first superficial notices of the objects that surround us, sufficient, perhaps, {{for the purpose of}} ordinary discrimination, but far too indeterminate and diffluent to be taken unexamined by the philosophic inquirer. The positions of science must be tried in the jeweller’s scales, not like the mixed commodities of the market, on the <b>weigh-bridge</b> of common opinion and vulgar usage. Such, however, has been the procedure in the present instance, and the result has been answerable to the coarseness of the process. By a comprisal of the petitio principii with the argumentum in circulo,—in plain English, by an easy logic, which begins with begging the question, and then moving in a circle, comes round {{to the point where it}} began,—each of the two divisions has been made to define the other by a mere reassertion of their assumed contrariety. The physiologist has luminously explained Y plus X by informing us that it is a somewhat that is the antithesis of Y minus X; and if we ask, what then is Y-X? the answer is, the antithesis of Y+X,—a reciprocation of great service, that may remind us of the twin sisters in the fable of the Lamiæ, with but one eye between them both, which each borrowed from the other as either happened to want it; but with this additional disadvantage, that in the present case it is after all but an eye of glass. The definitions themselves will best illustrate our meaning. I will begin with that given by Bichat. “Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted,” in which I have in vain endeavoured to discover any other meaning than that life consists in being able to live. This author, with a whimsical gravity, prefaces his definition with the remark, that the nature of life has hitherto been sought for in abstract considerations; as if it were possible that four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together in one sentence than are here assembled in the words, life, death, function, and resistance. Similar instances might be cited from Richerand and others. The word Life is translated into other more learned words; and this paraphrase of the term is substituted for the definition of the thing, and therefore (as is always the case in every real definition as contra-distinguished from a verbal definition,) for at least a partial solution of the fact. Such as these form the first class.—The second class takes some one particular function of Life common to all living objects,—nutrition, for instance; or, to adopt the phrase most in vogue at present, assimilation, for the purposes of reproduction and growth. Now this, it is evident, can be an appropriate definition only of the very lowest species, as of a Fungus or a Mollusca; and just as comprehensive an idea of the mystery of Life, as a Mollusca might give, can this definition afford. But this is not the only objection. For, first, it is not pretended that we begin with seeking for an organ evidently appropriated to nutrition, and then infer that the substance in which such an organ is found lives. On the contrary, in a number of cases among the obscurer animals and vegetables we infer the organ from the pre-established fact of its life. Secondly, it identifies the process itself with a certain range of its forms, those, namely, by which it is manifested in animals and vegetables. For this, too, no less than the former, presupposes the arbitrary division of all things into not living and lifeless, on which, as I before observed, all these definitions are grounded. But it is sorry logic to take the proof of an affirmative in one thing as the proof of the negative in another. All animals that have lungs breathe, but it would be a childish oversight to deduce the converse, viz. all animals that breathe have lungs. The theory in which the French chemists organized the discoveries of Black, Cavendish, Priestly, Scheele, and other English and German philosophers, is still, indeed, the reigning theory, but rather, it should seem, from the absence of a rival sufficiently popular to fill the throne in its stead, than from the continuance of an implicit belief in its own stability. We no longer at least cherish that intensity of faith which, before Davy commenced his brilliant career, had not only identified it with chemistry itself, but had substituted its nomenclature, even in common conversation, for the far more philosophic language which the human race had abstracted from the laboratory of Nature. I may venture to prophecy that no future Beddoes will make it the corival of the mathematical sciences in demonstrative evidence. I think it a matter of doubt whether, during the period of its supposed infallibility, physiology derived more benefit from the extension, or injury from the misdirection, of its views. Enough of the latter is fresh in recollection to make it but an equivocal compliment to a physiological position, that it must stand or fall with the corpuscular philosophy, as modified by the French theory of chemistry. Yet should it happen (and the event is not impossible, nor the supposition altogether absurd,) that more and more decisive facts should present themselves in confirmation of the metamorphosis of elements, the position that life consists in assimilation would either cease to be distinctive, or fall back into the former class as an identical proposition, namely, that Life, meaning by the word that sort of growth which takes place by means of a peculiar organization, consists in that sort of growth which is peculiar to organized life. Thirdly, the definition involves a still more egregious flaw in the reasoning, namely, that of cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (or the assumption of causation from mere coexistence); and this, too, in its very worst form. For it is not cum hoc solo, ergo propter hoc, which would in many cases supply a presumptive proof by induction, but cum hoc, et plurimis aliis, ergo propter hoc! Shell, of some kind or other, is common to the whole order of testacea, but it would be absurd to define the vis vitæ of testaceous animals as existing in the shell, though we know it to be the constant accompaniment, and have every reason to believe the constant effect, of the specific life that acts in those animals. Were we (argumenti [...] causá) to imagine shell coextensive with the organized creation, this would produce no abatement in the falsity of the reasoning. Nor does the flaw stop here; for a physiological, that is a real, definition, as distinguished from the verbal definitions of lexicography, must consist neither in any single property or function of the thing to be defined, nor yet in all collectively, which latter, indeed, would be a history, not a definition. It must consist, therefore, in the law of the thing, or in such an idea of it, as, being admitted, all the properties and functions are admitted by implication. It must likewise be so far causal, that a full insight having been obtained of the law, we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law. Suppose a disease in question, which appeared always accompanied with certain symptoms in certain stages, and with some one or more symptoms in all stages—say deranged digestion, capricious alternation of vivacity and languor, headache, dilated pupil, diminished sensibility to light, &c.—Neither the man who selected the one constant symptom, nor he who enumerated all the symptoms, would give the scientific definition talem scilicet, quali scientia fit vel datur, but the man who at once named and defined the disease hydrocephalus, producing pressure on the brain. For it is the essence of a scientific definition to be causative, not by introduction of imaginary somewhats, natural or supernatural under the name of causes, but by announcing the law of action in the particular case, in subordination to the common law of which all the phenomena are modifications or results.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a data acquisition solution using a RISC type microcontroller {{with a very}} few components around, {{taking advantage of the}} ratiometric functioning of the load cells. The need of thermally stable circuits is minimized through the use of the same amplification chain for both signal and reference. The amplification and filtering are done trough switched-capacitor techniques controlled by the microcontroller. This option allows the choice of the proper scale according to the platform and permits the auto-calibration of the system. The weighing tests show errors below 100 gr in 400 kg for an industrial platform of 8 smart load cells.

This paper describes, in outline form, a series of laboratory and field tests on an instrumented heavy goods vehicle. The vehicle was instrumented in the laboratory and an extensive series of calibration tests performed to establish the relationship between measurements of axle strain and vehicle load; this testing regime was also used to validate the instrumentation. A field trial was then conducted with the vehicle being returned to service and axle strain measurements being recorded continuously. Estimates of the static load were then validated against daily <b>weigh-bridge</b> measurements. The system has been in continuous service {{for several years now}} and {{has proven to be a}} robust and accurate method of calculating static vehicle load which can be easily installed on a vehicle at relatively low cost. When combined with a vehicle tracking unit real time load data can be made available to a fleet operator and on the spot load data displayed to the driver. Inadvertent overloading, with all its implications for safety and road damage, can thus be avoided...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pavement/vehicle {{interaction}} {{is one of}} the growing areas in asphalt pavement design. Traffic volumes have increased considerably over the past few decades, and not only are modern trucks carrying heavier payloads, but they are also using fewer tyres which have higher inflation pressures and hence higher contact stresses than was previously the case. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the variabilities associated with actual measured three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact loading/stress regimes of modern truck tyres. Tyre-pavement contact stress measurements were carried out on a busy national road (N 3) in South Africa from the port of Durban to the inland province of Gauteng. The three-dimensional tyre-pavement contact stress regimes of 45 227 individual tyres were measured using the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) system. In addition, the loading on each tyre was also captured. This measurement series was performed at slow (< 5 km/hr) creep speed conditions at a controlled <b>weigh-bridge</b> as part of the N 3 Traffic Control Centre (N 3 -TCC) near Heidelberg in SA. Mechanistic Analysis indicated that near surface Strain Energy of Distortion (SED) may be utilised for pavement rutting studies in this asphalt layers...|$|E
40|$|Transportation is an {{important}} cost of operations, representing about 15 % of the total wood value. One of the greatest opportunities to reduce transport cost is through increased payload, where every kilogram increase in payload represents between $ 5 and $ 10 savings per year. Improving payload reduces cost, and can also decrease the fuel use and carbon emissions from a fixed freight task by 3 % to 5 % for every tonne increase in payload. Under the load-restricted conditions of transport on public road networks, once the largest configuration is in use with good load management, {{the only way to}} legally increase payload is to decrease the tare weight of the vehicle by using the lightest design available. In some instances tare weight can be reduced by changing the specifications of the vehicle, i. e. by using lightweight bullbars, completely removing bullbars, or using lightweight material (aluminum over steel) for trailer construction. For this analysis, five companies provided one year of <b>weigh-bridge</b> data including vehicle identification, tare weight, gross weight and time of each load. This report is limited to examining the tare weights and focuses on the opportunity to reduce costs, fuel use and carbon emissions by improving the fleet to the lightest current vehicle design available...|$|E
