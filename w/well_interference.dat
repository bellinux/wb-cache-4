50|$|Samuel Laws {{became a}} {{professor}} at Westminster College in 1854. At the college's first commencement in June 1855, the Board of Trustees elected Laws {{to the position of}} president of the college. Laws was officially confirmed to the position in October of that year. His term as president of Westminster was highly successful. He raised funds to establish an endowment that compared favorably with the more established east coast schools, and enrollment ranked fourth among all colleges of the Presbyterian Church. Laws had a dominating personality, and he did not tolerate <b>well</b> <b>interference</b> from other school officials. Laws came into conflict with the Westminster trustees over matters of discipline, and at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 he was arrested and tried for treason after refusing to sign an oath of allegiance to the federal government. As a Virginia native, Laws was a southern sympathizer. He was removed from his position and jailed for three months in a St. Louis, Missouri prison, where he spent his time reading Aristotle. Laws was released on the condition that he leave the United States. He spent 1862 teaching in Paris, but in 1863 he returned to the United States and settled in New York.|$|E

The burden of well failure is more or less equally shared by all categories of farmers but small farmers are the worst victims of resource scarcity. As a result, overexploitation of groundwater has different impacts on different categories of farmers in terms of access to groundwater, cost and returns to groundwater irrigation and its negative externality cost. The study suggests maintaining inter-well distance to prevent resource mining and calls for supply and demand side interventions.

The work was funded under the Water Plan Program of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the aquifer for future water supply development. Future work will include a calibrated groundwater flow model of the Osceola County Rural Water District (OCRWD) northern wellfield, which will be used to predict future <b>well</b> <b>interference,</b> available drawdown, optimal maximum pumping rates, and quantifying induced (river) recharge. Based on the groundwater elevation data, surface water flows toward OCRWD and Iowa Lakes Regional Water (ILRW) wellfields. Without this induced recharge, high capacity production wells and irrigation wells would not be able to sustain their pumping rates during prolonged droughts. Groundwater recharge sources are precipitation, induced recharge from surface water, and seepage from glacial drift and terraces along the valley wall. A groundwater study conducted in 2011 calibrated an average annual groundwater recharge of approximately 8 inches within the alluvium near the ILRW wellfield in Clay County (Gannon, 2011). At an average groundwater recharge rate of 8 inches per year, approximately 13 billion gallons per year (bgy) of precipitation would recharge the aquifer. If we classify a severe drought as half the annual precipitation (Gannon, 2006), and we assume this corresponds to an estimated recharge of 4 inches per year (half the average recharge), approximately 6. 5 bgy of precipitation recharge enters the aquifer during a severe drought. Much of this recharge is removed from the aquifer through river baseflow and evapotranspiration. The actual rate of groundwater available for use would need to be quantified using hydrographs, analytical methods, and numerical modeling. Total current water usage for the study area, not including private wells, is estimated at 3. 1 billion gallons per year (8. 6 million gallons per day), with a peak usage of 16. 33 million gallons per day. <b>Well</b> <b>interference</b> likely occurs between the irrigation wells and the OCRWD and ILRW wells during peak summer-time usage. The application of a calibrated groundwater flow model will help evaluate the magnitude and significance of this <b>well</b> <b>interference.</b> The distribution of potential well yield was estimated by converting the transmissivity value to specific capacity, and multiplying this by one-half the saturated sand and gravel thickness. Potential well yields greater than 400 gallons per minute (gpm) are found near Spencer, ILRW, and OCRWD. There appears to be areas between the City of Everly and south of OCRWD, and near the upper Little Sioux River that have potential well yields less than 100 gpm. [URL]...|$|E

This study proposes correcting the method for analyzing flowing well tests presented by Jacob and Lohman (1952) by considering the head losses due to friction in the well casing. The application of the proposed correction allowed the determination of a transmissivity (T = 411 m(2) /d) and storage coefficient (S = 3 x 10 (- 4)) which appear to be representative for the confined Guarani Aquifer in the study area. Ignoring the correction due to head losses in the well casing, the error in transmissivity evaluation is about 18 %.

This thesis presents a field case history of the integrated analysis and interpretation developed using all of the available petrophysical, production, and well test data from the condensate zone of Block A, Santa Barbara Field (Monagas, Venezuela). The reservoir units in Santa Barbara Field present substantial structural and fluid complexity, which, in turn, presents broad challenges for assessment and optimization of well performance behavior. Approximately 60 well tests have been performed in the gas condensate sections within Santa Barbara Field, and the analysis and interpretation of this data suggests the existence of condensate banking and layered reservoir behavior, as well as "well interference" effects. We demonstrate and discuss analysis and interpretation techniques that can be utilized for wells that exhibit condensate banking, layered reservoir behavior, and <b>well</b> <b>interference</b> effects (where all of these phenomena are observed in the well performance data taken from Block A in Santa Barbara Field). We have established that the layered reservoir model (no crossflow), coupled with the model for a two-zone radial composite reservoir, is an appropriate reservoir model for the analysis and interpretation of well performance data (i. e., well test and production data) taken from wells in Santa Barbara Field. It is of particular importance to note our success in using the "well interference" approach to analyze and interpret well test data taken from several wells in Santa Barbara Field. While it is premature to make broad conclusions, it can be noted that <b>well</b> <b>interference</b> effects (interference between production wells) could be (and probably is) a major influence on the production performance of Santa Barbara Field. In addition, our well test analysis approach corroborates the use of the Correa and Ramey (variable rate) plotting function for the analysis of drillstem test (DST) data. In summary, we are able to use our integrated analysis developed for Block A (Santa Barbara Field) estimate areal distributions of "flow" properties (porosity, effective permeability, and skin factor), as well as "volumetric" properties (original gas-in-place, gas reserves, and reservoir drainage area (all on a "per-well" basis)) ...|$|E
