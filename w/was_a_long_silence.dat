25|$|New Zealand cricketer Warren Lees {{recounted the}} underarm {{incident}} on New Zealand's 20/20 current affairs show, on Thursday 17 February 2005. He {{said that after}} the affair there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> in the dressing room, which was broken suddenly and unexpectedly by fellow player Mark Burgess smashing a tea cup.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
5000|$|Hidden track: when track 11 ends, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> {{before the}} hidden bonus track [...] "Intro (The xx Booty Mix)" [...] (at 13:35) starts.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> ominous <b>silence,</b> {{broken only}} by quickly muttered invocations to the saints and to Our Lady.|$|R
6000|$|There had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Deronda {{had stood}} still, even thankful for an {{interval}} before {{he needed to}} say more, and Gwendolen had sat like a statue with her wrists lying over each other and her eyes fixed--the intensity of her mental action arresting all other excitation. At length something {{occurred to her that}} made her turn her face to Deronda and say in a trembling voice-- ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> {{which was}} again {{interrupted}} by the stranger.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Then Anna spoke {{more seriously}} than usual.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Joan {{felt the}} tears {{trickling}} between her fingers.|$|E
60|$|Bobby's {{sentence}} {{died away}} as The Infant collapsed on a divan {{and said no}} more than, 'Your commissions!' There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> again <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> He whistled {{to himself}} {{like a man}} much {{agitated}} but defiant. Suddenly she went across to him and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> soft <b>silence,</b> {{that seemed}} to last for ever. Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Then Peter spoke three words, {{straight}} from the heart.|$|E
60|$|Hilary bowed. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Mr. Stone's {{eyes had}} {{travelled}} to the window.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed his}} eyes. The cigar dropped from his fingers. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pained <b>silence.</b> The {{little man}} seemed {{withered}} by the coarse {{brutality of the}} reply. In his face was unutterable hurt and woe.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her and smiled. He saw she was pure woman. He had met at last with a sister soul. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> deep <b>silence.</b>|$|R
6000|$|There <b>was</b> then <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Ridley murmured <b>a</b> {{few lines}} of poetry under his breath, and remarked, {{as if to}} conceal {{the fact that he}} had done so, [...] "Very hot to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Her {{face was}} radiant like gold, {{as she sat}} thinking.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Then {{the coroner}} asked the usual {{question}} of the jurymen.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Then {{the door}} closed gently and he heard her go upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'True! True! Correct! Correct!' {{said the}} Subadar-Major. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> easy <b>silence.</b> One heard a water-wheel {{creaking}} somewhere and the nearer sound of meal being {{ground in a}} quern.|$|R
60|$|There had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> whilst Ursula {{mounted the}} stairs and finally disappeared, but the rustle of her silk skirt did not {{penetrate}} through the solid panels of the closet door. Wessex {{did not know whether}} she had gone, or had been ordered to wait until Her Majesty had quitted the room. He wondered now how soon he would meet her, how she would look when she finally released him from this torture-chamber. He knew that he would not upbraid her, and feared but one awful eventuality, his own weakness if she were guilty.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{minute of}} <b>silence.</b> Shorty {{was the first}} to speak.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> The {{men looked}} in one another's faces, and Keesh went on eating.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> {{during which}} the old frontiersman sat gazing into the fire with sad eyes.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> {{at the end}} {{of which}} Herries uttered another cry, but upon an entirely new note.|$|E
25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefullyâ€”we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|R
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{peculiar}} <b>silence,</b> {{and then}} the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly: [...] "I won't take you back." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{all three}} listened intently. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> spell of <b>silence,</b> {{and then from}} a {{distance}} came an answering whistle, that sounded like an echo of their own.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> broken at last by a {{firework}} {{display of}} expletives. Mrs. Porter, still smiling, sat unmoved.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> {{during which}} Holmes leaned his chin upon {{his hands and}} stared into the {{crackling}} fire.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Each was {{undergoing}} a self-revelation; each {{was trying to}} face a future without the other.|$|E
60|$|Once I heard a great uproar in the village. Men were shouting--women were {{screaming}} and moaning. After a time this subsided, and again there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> interval of <b>silence.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. What {{could she}} say? As the world went, {{they had known}} each other rather less than eight and a half hours, but the matter was one that did not concern the world. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> while the breath in their {{nostrils}} drew cold and sharp as it might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fume of ether.|$|R
60|$|They had all {{listened intently}} to Ozma's story, {{and when she}} {{finished}} speaking there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of <b>silence</b> while all thought upon the curious magical power of the Water of Oblivion.|$|R
