5|$|As well as {{numerous}} stand-alone sketches and songs, the show also had many recurring items. Each show <b>would</b> <b>open</b> with Wood performing a stand-up comedy monologue, often using material {{she had already}} honed on her stage tours. Within the half-hours that followed, there were usually several fairly regular sketch items mixed in.|$|E
5|$|Completion was {{postponed}} to July 4, before being again postponed to late summer 1940 when rain delayed paving operations. Paving would conclude {{by the end}} of the summer, and on September 30 the turnpike commission announced that the road <b>would</b> <b>open</b> on October 1, 1940. Since the turnpike was opened on short notice, no ribbon-cutting ceremony was held.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Stephenson and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company, a {{locomotive}} works at Forth Street, Newcastle, {{from which the}} following year the S ordered two steam locomotives and two stationary engines. On 16 September 1825, with the stationary engines in place, the first locomotive, Locomotion No. 1, left the works, and the following day it was advertised that the railway <b>would</b> <b>open</b> on 27 September 1825.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Alton Towers {{added the}} Thunder Looper roller coaster; the {{addition}} was only temporary due to planning restrictions imposed on its installation. The park began {{planning for a}} new roller coaster which <b>would</b> <b>open</b> prior {{the closure of the}} Thunder Looper. They desired a roller coaster that was big, different and exciting, but they were constrained by the tree-level height limit imposed on the park.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, Universal {{confirmed}} that the roller coaster would not open as originally planned and said it <b>would</b> <b>open</b> in the summer. Though Universal has never mentioned what the exact problem with the roller coaster was, it is believed by newspapers that issues with the anti-rollback devices on the lift hill that were not working correctly caused the delay.|$|E

The group also sponsored billboard advertising criticizing McConnell in the heavily Republican counties of Clay, Laurel, Madison, Pulaski and Whitley.

5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{announced that it}} <b>would</b> <b>open</b> two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community.

She {{said it would be}} a short-term solution to the problem and that temporary detention centres would be closed.|$|E
5|$|Malone took up {{the study}} of law, {{becoming}} a solicitor in 1894 and a barrister five years later. In 1903, {{the same year that}} he and his family moved to New Plymouth, he formed a partnership dealing mostly with land transactions with James McVeagh and W. D. Anderson. The partners <b>would</b> <b>open</b> several law offices around the Taranaki region.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, Six Flags Great Adventure {{announced}} that it <b>would</b> <b>open</b> a Green Lantern-themed roller coaster in 2011.

5|$|Six Flags Fiesta Texas {{announced}} in August 2012, {{that they would}} be revamping their wooden coaster, The Rattler, into a steel track coaster, to be called Iron Rattler. The renovation would be performed by Rocky Mountain Construction and would feature the I-Box steel track on some of the original wooden coaster supports, Rattler-themed trains supplied by Gerstlauer, and a barrel roll. The new ride <b>would</b> <b>open</b> for the 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn. Stavka hoped a quick breakthrough at the Emaj√µgi front <b>would</b> <b>open</b> {{a path for}} the armoured units to the north, thus cutting the Army Detachment Narwa {{off from the rest}} of Army Group North. The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, and concentrated their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E
5|$|With {{the funds}} released, {{construction}} on the Green Line proceeded quickly. In November 1986, WMATA awarded a $36.2 million contract to Mergentime Corp. to build the Navy Yard Station. A month later, WMATA awarded a $19.5 million contract to excavate a tunnel from the Navy Yard Station to the tunnels being built under the Anacostia River. On March 23, 1986, {{the second of the}} two 2,450-foot (747.25 metre), concrete-lined tunnels under the Anacostia River was completed. With the tunnels finished and other contracts awarded, WMATA announced yet another revised timeline for opening the Green Line in April 1987. The transit agency estimated that the Mount Vernon Square, Shaw, and U Street stations <b>would</b> <b>open</b> in late 1990, the Mount Vernon Square to Anacostia link in late 1991, and the Fort Totten to Greenbelt link by 1994. In January 1988, WMATA awarded a $179.1 million contract to build the Green Line from Fort Totten to Greenbelt, and a $6.9 million contract to complete the Waterfront station. In December 1988, WMATA reaffirmed that the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations <b>would</b> <b>open</b> in late 1991.|$|E

5|$|Written by Alan Drury, {{the scripts}} were {{commissioned}} on 2 April 1979 for this four-part story. The story {{was set in}} the Victorian era and the entire action would take place in and around a vicarage. The vicar has recently died and fake spiritualists are exploiting the widow. The first episode <b>would</b> <b>open</b> with a seance during which the TARDIS would arrive. On 19 September 1979, the story was accepted subject to alterations.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that <b>would</b> <b>open</b> the door for an Egyptian take-over {{and the loss of}} his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs <b>would</b> <b>open</b> fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 1911 and January 11, 1913, it was {{announced}} that the station <b>would</b> be <b>open</b> during the winter. On November 4, 1913, it {{was announced}} that the station <b>would</b> be <b>opened</b> anytime where necessary. The freight service started from June 1, 1917. The temporary stop was renamed as ≈ånuma on June 15, 1920 and promoted to a full station on November 11, 1924.|$|R
50|$|Eleven more Chinese ports <b>would</b> be <b>opened</b> {{for foreign}} trade, {{including}} Newchwang, Tamsui (Taiwan), Hankou and Nanjing.|$|R
