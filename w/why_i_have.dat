5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
500|$|Critchell re-signed for Weymouth on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} {{for an undisclosed}} fee on 9 August 2012, with the club now in the Southern League Premier Division. He explained the transfer by saying [...] "The biggest reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come back is seeing everyone smiling and being positive again. The right atmosphere seems to {{be back at the}} club and that can only bode well for the future".|$|E
500|$|In , {{the authors}} utilize {{statements}} made by Homer in the episode to analyze the difference between heuristic and algorithmic decision-making. Homer explains to Lisa, [...] "Stupid risks are what make life worth living. Now your mother, she's the steady type and that's fine in small doses, but me, I'm a risk-taker. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> so many adventures!" [...] The authors of The Psychology of The Simpsons interpret this statement by Homer to mean that he [...] "relies on his past experiences of taking massive, death-defying risks and winding up okay to justify forging ahead in the most extreme circumstances".|$|E

500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is too often. The name of Arsenal has been sullied and that is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken this action." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his {{liner notes}} to the 2010 reissue of That's the Way God Planned It, Preston's first Apple album, music {{journalist}} Andy Davis {{refers to the}} American musician's extended [...] "apprenticeship", and quotes from a 1975 interview in which Preston said: [...] "I’ve never asked anybody to help me or give me a break. What I don't have now I believe will come. <b>Why?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say it's God … the God in me." [...] Davis describes these sentiments as the [...] "lyrical thrust" [...] behind Preston's composition [...] "That's the Way God Planned It".|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{included}} neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings {{reflect his}} Catholic worldview. In {{one of his}} letters Tolkien states, [...] "The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism." ...|$|E

[...] "I agree that what is needed is a real discussion by the candidates about their vision for the future of our country." [...] He suggested that the first debate be held in New Hampshire.|$|E
2500|$|Gerrard {{missed the}} start of the 2011–12 season due to a groin injury, which had also kept him out of action for large parts of the {{previous}} season. Gerrard later went on to reveal he rejected the chance to join Bayern Munich in the summer to focus on getting Liverpool back in the Champions League, saying [...] "...a traditional club like Liverpool still has a value, that's the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stuck around for so long... {{it is more important to}} win a couple of trophies and achieve something that is a lot more difficult than go down the easy road and move to a club where it becomes easier." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New York Times magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. [...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what I decided to do with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to use film directors as a model." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Elric's {{albinism}} appears {{influenced by}} Monsieur Zenith, an albino Sexton Blake villain whom Moorcock appreciated enough to write into later multiverse stories.

In fact it was a friend who found it {{under lock and key}} and got a copy of it to Savoy who are, at last, about to reprint it! <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> spent so much energy making public the evidence of my vast theft from Anthony Skene, I'm not entirely sure... [...] Moorcock later said, [...] "As I've said in my introduction to Monsieur Zenith: The Albino, the Anthony Skenes character was a huge influence. For the rest of the character, his ambiguities in particular, I based him on myself at the age I was when I created Elric, which was 20". The influence of Zenith on Elric is often cited in discussions of Zenith.|$|E
