5|$|Having, it is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been copied directly from it.|$|E
5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} activity undertaken {{during the reign}} of Djedkare Isesi was the construction of his pyramid complex in Saqqara. Djedkare also either completed or undertook restoration works in the funerary complex of Nyuserre Ini in Abusir, as indicated by a now damaged inscription, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> detailed Djedkare's activities on the site. Further building works took place in Abusir {{during the second half of}} Djedkare's reign following the curious decision by members of the royal family to be buried there rather than next to Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. A group of mastabas was thus constructed for princess Kekheretnebti and her daughter Tisethor, princess Hedjetnebu, the courtiers Mernefu and Idu, who was buried with his wife Khenit, and prince Neserkauhor.|$|E
5|$|By 17:35, Sydney {{was heading}} south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from {{multiple}} fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing {{and could not}} be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> happened some time earlier. The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E

5|$|John Komnenos was {{a rather}} {{unimportant}} figure in the court, and in a marginal note dating to the late 13th century, Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos, who briefly became emperor during Constantinople's final siege by the Fourth Crusade, was named as the real mastermind behind the coup. He was certainly supported by a wider circle of nobles from the Komnenian era, possibly even the brothers Alexios Komnenos and David Komnenos, who later founded the Empire of Trebizond. Thus the historian Michael Angold traces the coup's inception {{to the events of}} early 1199, when Alexios III married his two daughters Irene and Anna to Alexios Palaiologos and Theodore Laskaris respectively. This marriage not only spoke of increasing confidence for the Emperor, but also provided for the imperial succession and began the establishment of a separate aristocratic power-base, <b>which</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> displeased many noble families.|$|E

5000|$|Imitation is {{explained}} in terms of social learning theory, which argues that [...] "humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences". Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, <b>which</b> people <b>must</b> <b>have</b> seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, <b>which</b> the learner <b>must</b> <b>have</b> the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, <b>which</b> people <b>must</b> <b>have</b> sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.|$|R
