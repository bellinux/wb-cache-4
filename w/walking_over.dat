5|$|The City of Gretna on the West Bank of the Mississippi River {{received}} considerable {{press coverage}} when, {{in the aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina (late August 2005), displaced and dehydrated survivors who attempted to escape from New Orleans by <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the edge of the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the edge of the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} known for its large populations of caribou, which summer there before {{migrating}} in the autumn by <b>walking</b> south <b>over</b> the sea ice.|$|R
50|$|For the 2007 {{season as}} a whole, Bergmann accrued a win-loss record of 6-6 and a 4.45 ERA, {{striking}} out 86 batters and <b>walking</b> 42 <b>over</b> 115⅓ innings.|$|R

25|$|In May 1892 Scottish Mountaineer William W. Naismith devised Naismith's rule while <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> Cruach Ardrain {{on the way}} to the {{neighbouring}} mountain of Ben More. The rule is a simple formula for estimating walking time taking into account not just distance but also height to be ascended.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} {{began on}} 13 November at 7:30p.m. when Gray confronted neighbour Garry Holden {{about one of}} Holden's dogs wandering onto his property. After the confrontation, Gray went into his house, retrieved a Norinco 84S semi-automatic rifle, walked outside and shot Holden multiple times in his chest, before <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> to him and shooting him fatally through the head.|$|E
25|$|TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter that {{requires}} players to kill enemies and complete objectives {{using a variety}} of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios. Armour and health bars {{on the sides of the}} screen lower when the player is shot, which can be increased by <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> body armor and medical kits.|$|E

25|$|At present, {{the primary}} method of {{controlling}} desert locust infestations is with insecticides applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at ultra-low volume (ULV) rates of application. The insecticide is {{acquired by the}} insect directly or via secondary pickup (i.e. <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> or eating the residue on a plant). Control is undertaken by government agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized {{organizations such as the}} Desert Locust Control Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA).|$|E
25|$|San Francisco stormed back, driving 70 {{yards in}} seven plays on a drive that {{consumed}} only 2:24 {{and ended with}} Garcia's 26-yard touchdown pass to Owens. Owens added a 2-point conversion catch on the next play, cutting the 49ers deficit to 38–22. After the play, an iconic scene of defensive lineman Michael Strahan <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> to Owens and pointing to the scoreboard {{to remind him of}} the deficit they still faced would be a highlight of the game.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{constructed}} of hardwood planking and selectively clad with armour plate, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat {{with a crew}} of four could ferry an infantry platoon of 31, with space to spare for five additional specialist troops, to shore at 7 knots (13km/h). Men generally entered the boat by <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> a gangplank from the boat deck of a troop transport as the LCA hung from its davits. When loaded, the LCA was lowered into the water. Soldiers exited by the boat's bow ramp.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} low humidity in extraterrestrial environments, very large static charges can accumulate, causing a major hazard for the complex electronics used in space exploration vehicles. Static electricity {{is thought to}} be a particular hazard for astronauts on planned missions to the Moon and Mars. <b>Walking</b> <b>over</b> {{the extremely}} dry terrain could cause them to accumulate a significant amount of charge; reaching out to open the airlock on their return could cause a large static discharge, potentially damaging sensitive electronics.|$|E
25|$|In September 2003, TV3 again {{launched}} {{a new set of}} idents. Again, this series of idents consisted of live action scenes. The final scene would see a large 'swoosh' effect {{in the center of the}} screen with the 3 logo appearing in the centre of the screen. These idents consisted of outdoor activities such as a walk at the beach, children playing football, children playing, people <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the Ha'penny bridge etc. The presentation package was produced by Bruce Dunlop Associates.|$|E
25|$|A committal shelter {{was built}} for the {{observance}} of funeral services. The committal shelter, or funeral shelter, is a roofed pavilion, open on three sides, and was intended to make graveside services unnecessary, as elderly mourners may have difficulty <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> uneven ground. The shelter can mitigate the inconvenience of inclement weather. Within the shelter is a bier for the casket, and space to accommodate twenty chairs for family members. In 1998, Camp Nelson National Cemetery {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places (Reference #98001134).|$|E

50|$|Tour of the Lake District is a 93 mi walking {{route through}} the English Lake District. It is not waymarked, but is {{recognised}} by the Long Distance Walkers Association, and by several commercial companies which offer packaged <b>walking</b> holidays <b>over</b> the route.|$|R
50|$|Today's {{infrastructure}} of the station consists of the station building, two low-lying through passenger platforms and one cargo platform, <b>walking</b> bridge <b>over</b> south yard neck. Station layout consists of 8 tracks including 2 stub ended tracks (the first six tracks are electrified 25 kV AC system).|$|R
25|$|In hand-to-hand combat, {{the player}} {{has four main}} attacks; high kick, low kick, punch, and grapple. After hitting an enemy {{a certain number of}} times, the enemy will be stunned, at which point the player can perform a combo by {{pressing}} a series of buttons. During stealth missions, the player is automatically placed into stealth mode. The player can approach enemies from behind and either knock them out or kill them. Bumping into objects or <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> broken glass or plastic bags will cause nearby enemies to become aware of the player's presence.|$|E
25|$|They feed in {{the mornings}} and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the plant, with legs {{on both sides and}} using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down {{to the level of the}} mouth. Mothers also use this {{technique}} to make food edible for their calves. They drink for a minute or two at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.|$|E
25|$|Hiking {{boots are}} {{designed}} to provide extra ankle and arch support, as well as extra padding for comfort during hiking. They are constructed to provide comfort for miles of <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> rough terrains, and protect the hiker's feet against water, mud, rocks, and other wilderness obstacles. These boots support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's movement too much. They are fairly stiff to support the foot. A properly fitted boot and/or friction-reducing patches applied to troublesome areas ensures protection against blisters and other discomforts associated with long hikes on rugged terrain.|$|E
5000|$|October 2006 was {{the first}} ever International Walk to School Month. The month of {{activities}} meant it fitted around school holidays across the globe, as well as giving people time to [...] "develop the <b>walking</b> habit". <b>Over</b> 10 million pupils, across 40 different countries took part.|$|R
50|$|Mass {{participation}} and religious devotion are unmatched, for the Jat involves {{a long and}} arduous journey over treacherous terrains rising to an altitude of 5335 mts. at Jiura Gali Dhar from a near 900 mts. at Nauti, <b>walking</b> barefoot <b>over</b> snow and moraines and passing through deep forests.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Kabir's film Guns 3 is {{released}} and is hugely successful {{at the box}} office. In the end, Kabir proposes to Ayesha and they reunite, just like Roy and Tia in Kabir's film.
