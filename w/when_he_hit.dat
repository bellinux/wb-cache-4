5|$|In 1996, Bonds {{became the}} first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. The {{other members of the}} 40–40 club are José Canseco–1988, Alex Rodriguez–1998, and Alfonso Soriano–2006; his father Bobby Bonds was one home run short in 1973 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> 39 home runs and stole 43 bases.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following year <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower.

5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part {{of some of the most}} memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Mets' lead {{began to}} dissipate, as the Phillies {{combined}} several solid series; Rollins {{was a key}} component of their success. Rollins was named the National League Player of the Week for August 27 to September 2, 2007. On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves, Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30–30 season. On {{the last day of the}} 2007 season, Rollins became the seventh player to collect at least 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in one season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> his 20th triple of the year in a 6–1 win over the Washington Nationals that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies, which confirmed Rollins' preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence. The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World Series loss; however, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Mick Foley faced Ric Flair in a 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match. Foley gained the {{advantage}} after he executed a Double Underhook DDT. Foley {{then began to}} taunt Flair and took out Mr. Socko, a dirty sock puppet, dressed like Flair. Foley controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the Figure-Four Leglock, but Flair countered with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall. Frustrated, Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring {{and brought it to}} the ring to hit Flair with it. But, Flair avoided the attacked, as he tripped Foley to apply the Figure-Four Leglock. At the end, Foley got disqualified <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> Flair with the trash can. The referee awarded Flair the win. After the match, Foley attacked Flair with a barb-wired bat, leaving Flair busted open.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match of}} the pay-per-view {{was supposed to}} be Ludvig Borga vs. Tatanka. The two were engaged in a feud that began prior to Survivor Series 1993. Tatanka had been undefeated in the WWF since his debut in 1991. Borga ended this streak on the October 30, 1993 edition of WWF Superstars (taped on September 28, 1993), <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> Tatanka with a steel chair while the referee was distracted. As a results of storyline injuries from this attack and the beating he suffered afterward at the hands of Borga and Yokozuna, Tatanka was forced to miss the main event match at Survivor Series. Although Tatanka defeated Borga by disqualification on the December 20, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw, the bitterness between the two remained.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. The third and final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Clint Bowyer was fastest, placing ahead of Biffle in second, and Johnson in third. Gordon was fourth fastest, and Edwards placed fifth. Kurt Busch, David Ragan, Jeff Burton, Keselowski and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Max Papis damaged {{the right-hand side of}} his car <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> the turn two wall; Jamie McMurray, David Reutimann and Mike Bliss also hit the turn two wall. Bliss went to a back-up car because {{the right side of his}} car was heavily damaged. John Andretti's engine failed during the early phase of the session, and Andretti changed engines. Burton switched to a back-up car after he collided with the turn two outside wall.|$|E

5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|Hamence scored 58 and 45 in {{his first}} match upon return to Australia, playing for Bradman's XI against a team captained by Lindsay Hassett on 3 December 1948. He then scored a career best 173 against New South Wales, and 55 the {{following}} match against Queensland. He then faced Western Australia for his 91st first-class match, scoring another century <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> 117 against Western Australia. Hamence then suffered a loss of form, not exceeding 31 for 11innings. He scored a 53 against New South Wales, 64notout against Queensland and 58 against Victoria, however he then scored nine, one and five in his next three innings. A 48 and 78 against New South Wales and Western Australia followed, however it was becoming clear that his form was waning. Hamence played his final match against Freddie Brown's MCC team on 27 October 1950, scoring 114 in the first innings as South Australia reached 350, and then seven in his final innings before being run out by Bob Berry. His final full season saw him score 418runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.|$|E

5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook Bräck {{around the}} outside at turn three and moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of Bräck {{around the outside}} at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the side of their cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged the left side of his car <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner. Moreno was sent into a spin while Takagi's suspension had broke and retired from the event. de Ferran and Tagliani made pit stops for fuel and tires during the caution and could reach the end of the race without a second pit stop. De Ferran and Tagliani rejoined in 14th and 15th places.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race: two on Friday {{and one on}} Saturday. The first session ran for 105 minutes, the second 75 minutes, and the third 60 minutes. Conditions were foggy for the first session which cleared up later in the day. Junqueira was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 31.948 seconds; Tora Takagi was second and Paul Tracy third. Kenny Bräck was fourth-fastest, ahead of da Matta and Patrick Carpentier. Papis, Tony Kanaan, Michel Jourdain Jr. and Roberto Moreno rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Five yellow caution flags came out: the first was for Carpentier who had an engine failure while entering the fourth turn, the second for Bräck when he collided heavily with the turn four outside wall. Adrian Fernández's engine failed which littered debris onto the track, Papis spun after leaving the frontstretch and damaged his rear-end of his car <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> the pit road exit barrier. A track inspection was necessitated when Castroneves' car leaked fluid onto the circuit.|$|E
5|$|After {{protracted}} negotiations, Bill Nicholson signed Greaves for Tottenham Hotspur in December 1961 for £99,999– {{the unusual}} fee {{was intended to}} relieve Greaves of the pressure {{of being the first}} £100,000 player in British football. He joined Spurs just after they became the first club in England to complete the First Division and FA Cup double during the 20th century. He played his first game in a Spurs shirt for the reserve team on 9 December 1961, and scored twice in a 4–1 win over Plymouth Argyle Reserves at Home Park. He scored a hat-trick on his first team debut, including a flying scissor kick, in a 5–2 win over Blackpool at White Hart Lane. He went on to feature against Benfica in the semi-finals of the European Cup; in the first leg at the Estádio da Luz he had a goal disallowed for offside, and another disallowed in the return fixture also for offside. He played in all seven games of the club's FA Cup run, scoring nine goals in the competition as they beat Birmingham City (after a replay), Plymouth Argyle, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and Manchester United to reach the 1962 FA Cup Final against Burnley at Wembley. Greaves opened the scoring against Burnley on 3 minutes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> a low shot past goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw from a tight angle, and Spurs {{went on to win the}} game 3–1. They finished the league in third place in 1961–62, four points behind champions Ipswich Town.|$|E
