In order to investigate this discrepancy between spatial positioning and temporal sequencing for vowels in Thai, eye movements of twenty university students reading 50 pairs of words with misaligned and aligned vowel words matched for length and frequency embedded in same sentence frames was conducted. In addition, rapid naming data from 40 adults was collected. Behavioural data from children 6 to 9 years old reading and spelling comparable words was also analysed.

In response to a teacher generated prompt, 10 th-grade students completed 3 brief constructed response (BCR) and 2 extended constructed response (ECR) writing samples throughout the academic year. Writing samples were scored for total words written (TWW), words spelled correctly (WSC), correct <b>writing</b> <b>sequences</b> (CWS), correct minus incorrect <b>writing</b> <b>sequences</b> (CMIWS), percentage of words spelled correctly (%WSC), percentage of correct <b>writing</b> <b>sequences</b> (%CWS), production dependent index, and production independent index.

Alternate form reliability correlation coefficients between scoring measures were only in the weak to moderate range. Results revealed that girls wrote more words, spelled more words correctly, produced more correct <b>writing</b> <b>sequences,</b> and produced more correct minus incorrect <b>writing</b> <b>sequences.</b> Across <b>writing</b> samples, statistically significant but small increases were found on scoring measures.

40|$|Starting {{with some}} sceptical {{remarks on the}} idea that the {{relationship}} between linguistics and literary studies has broken down and that linguistics is primarily concerned with texts for daily use, the article proposes some elements of a text-linguistic approach covering notions, ideas and activities long since familiar to literary scholars, especially those preparing editions. The notion of virtual text is introduced to denote the abstract entity underlying different versions and copies of one and the same text. Following Ehlich's suggestion that a (prototypical) text is not necessarily a <b>written</b> <b>sequence</b> of signs, but a complex sign passed on by tradition, the importance of reproducing texts - and hence the role of members of the speaking community in producing textuality - is emphasized: Re-reading, reciting, reading aloud to others, reprinting, reediting, and even rewriting, resuming or referring to, by allusions are different means of transmitting the text or elements of it to others, including the following generations. Some of them require a complete 'cognitive copy' of the text, but the longer the text is, the more probable it is that only fragments are part of the linguistic knowledge of (groups of) the community. Nevertheless, (fragments of) texts can be stocked in the individual memory, just as lexical items are. The last chapter presents the number and type of transmission authorities (commercial editors, scientific editors, lecturers, literary agents, and so on), as well as the number and type of versions and copies as criteria to differentiate texts for daily use, scientific and literary texts...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissetation. August 2009. Major: Philosophy. Advisors: Doug Lewis, Sandra Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 156 pages, appendices A-B. Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations is an unconventionally <b>written</b> <b>sequence</b> of about 700 short remarks which often contain brief dialogues between {{the author and}} many unidentified voices. This unconventional form poses major difficulties to interpretation, particularly together with Wittgenstein’s professed intentions of criticizing the very activity of philosophy, maybe {{to the point of}} ending it. Between two broad camps of interpretation—readings attempting to paraphrase the book into standard argumentative forms, and ‘therapeutic’ readings which see the book’s criticism of philosophy as an achievement of certain of its elements fundamentally resistant to paraphrase—this dissertation supports the latter, arguing that the Investigations lacks a complementary relationship between its formal structure (distinct, non-hierarchicallyordered remarks) and its rhetorical structure (in its use of ‘signposting’ at salient structural locations to guide the reader’s progress). Failing to satisfy these conventions, the book does not permit an argumentative reading, and thus lacks a structure permitting paraphrase into argumentative form. This reading begins with a survey of ‘signposting’ rhetoric through the entire text, then selects four key locations for suggesting argumentative structure: § 1, § 65, the ‘philosophy sections’ 89 – 133, and the final remark. A close reading of each shows that the text permits a conventional, ‘argumentative’ interpretation only when the reader distorts the text; and that it permits an unconventional, ‘therapeutic’ interpretation when the reader attends more carefully to his own role in identifying what happens in the text, using its formal and rhetorical features as checks on interpretation. After this argument concerning large-scale structure, an objection that the book’s many brief dialogues constitute arguments is addressed with an interpretation of the unusual dialogue in § 28. The dissertation concludes with two essays in practical criticism. The first concerns textual features and critical concepts which must be at the forefront of any attempt to capture a stronger sense of resistance to paraphrase—that the reader has to read the Investigations ‘for himself’. The second considers how a paraphrase-resistant reading and a focus on ‘therapeutic’ criticism of philosophy are reinforced by a different perspective on the Investigations’ place in the history of philosophy...|$|E

The current study investigated the effects of peer-mediated goal setting and feedback on curriculum-based measurement indices of written expression. Participants were 106 students in six 5 th-grade classrooms completed bi-weekly writing probes and classrooms were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition. Students in the experimental group received peer-mediated goal setting and feedback and students in the control condition did not receive any information regarding performance or goals. The results revealed that students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control condition on the Total Words Written index over time. The results also indicated that students in the experimental classrooms had significantly higher rates of growth on the Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, and Correct <b>Writing</b> <b>Sequences</b> indices. Rates of growth for the Percentage of Words Spelled Correctly, Percentage of Correct <b>Writing</b> <b>Sequences,</b> and Correct Minus Incorrect <b>Writing</b> <b>Sequences</b> indices were similar.

This paper presents a new statistical method to reconstruct the writing order of a handwritten script from a two-dimensional static image. The reconstruction process consists of two phases, named the training phase and the testing phase. In the training phase, the writing order with other attributes, such as length and direction, are extracted from a set of training on-line handwritten scripts statistically to form a universal writing model (UWM). In the testing phase, UWM is applied to reconstruct the drawing order of offline handwritten scripts by finding the highest total probability. 300 off-line signatures with ground truth are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the reconstructed <b>writing</b> <b>sequence</b> using UWM is close to the actual <b>writing</b> <b>sequence.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Part 7 : Session 7 : Best Paper – 2 International audienceThe limited {{lifespan}} is the Achilles’s heel of Solid State Drive (SSD) {{based on}} NAND flash memory. NAND flash has two drawbacks that degrade SSD’s lifespan. One is the out-of-place update. Another is the sequential write constraint within a block. To extend the lifespan, SSD usually employs a write buffer to reduce write traffic to flash memory. However, existing write buffer schemes only {{pay attention to}} the first drawback, but fail to overcome the second one. We propose a virtual write buffer architecture, which covers the two aspects simultaneously. The virtual buffer consists of two components, DRAM and the reorder area. DRAM is the normal write buffer which aims at the first drawback. It endeavors to reduce write traffic to flash memory as much as possible by pursuing higher hit ratio. The reorder area is actually a part of SSD’s flash address space. It focuses on reordering <b>write</b> <b>sequence</b> directed to flash chip. Reordering <b>write</b> <b>sequence</b> helps to overcome the second drawback. The two components work together just like the virtual memory adopted by operating system. So, we name the architecture as virtual write buffer. Our virtual write buffer outperforms traditional write buffers because of two reasons. First, the DRAM can adopt any existing superior cache replacement policy, it achieves higher hit ratio than traditional write buffers do. Second, the virtual write buffer reorders the <b>write</b> <b>sequence,</b> which hasn’t been exploited by traditional write buffers. We compare the virtual write buffer with others by trace-driven simulations. Experimental results show that, SSDs employing the virtual buffer survive longer lifespan on most workloads...|$|R

The most attractive characteristic of SSD is its high random read speed because of no mechanical latency. However, poor random write performance becomes the bottle neck in wider applications. Random write is almost two orders of magnitude slower than both random read and sequential access. In our database prototype based on Oracle Berkeley DB (BDB), we propose to insert unmodified data into random <b>write</b> <b>sequence</b> in order to convert random writes into sequential writes, and then data sequence can be flushed at the speed of sequential write. Further, we optimize the write performance by reducing quantity of unmodified data to be inserted.

40|$|All {{published}} studies on micrographia, a diminution of letter size, examine handwriting in the horizontal direction. Writing horizontally typically requires increased wrist extension as handwriting progresses {{from left to}} right. Chinese characters, however, can be written not only horizontally from left to right, but also vertically from top to bottom. We examined the effect of handwriting direction on character size and stroke length. Fifteen participants with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 15 age-matched controls wrote the same Chinese characters both horizontally and vertically. Handwriting performance was recorded with a digitizing tablet, and a custom-written computer program was used to provide objective data about character size and stroke length. The PD group had a linear decrease in overall character size and horizontal strokes along the <b>writing</b> <b>sequence</b> in the horizontal direction, {{but not in the}} vertical direction. The controls had shorter horizontal strokes in the horizontal than the vertical direction, but there was no progressive shortening of stroke length along the <b>writing</b> <b>sequence.</b> The results suggest that traditionally reported progressive micrographia in horizontal writing may not be generalizable to vertical writing. The observed decrease of handwriting size in the horizontal direction suggests that micrographia in PD may be associated with wrist extension.
