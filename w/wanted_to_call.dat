5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{was unable}} to {{directly}} influence the Johnson administration, which expanded U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He became increasingly wary of what he felt was undue influence by the CIA and big businesses on foreign policy. In 1964 during {{the debate over the}} Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Senator Wayne Morse <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Shoup to testify against the measure, but was blocked by Senator J. William Fulbright. On 14 May 1966, Shoup began publicly attacking the policy in a speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California, for their World Affairs Day.|$|E

When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four Sides to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play on {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver.

25|$|To {{make up for}} {{the lack}} of an album, Sheer Terror re-recorded many of the songs from Ugly And Proud, {{releasing}} the result on Blackout as Thanks Fer Nuthin, a jab at the owner of Maze Records.

En route, the engineer told the taxi driver that he felt unsafe leaving a locomotive running while it was spitting oil and thick, black smoke. He said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the US office of MMA (in Hermon, Maine) as {{they would be able}} to give him other directives.

Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.|$|E

25|$|Karel Čapek {{introduced}} and made popular the frequently used international word robot, which {{first appeared in}} his play R.U.R. in 1920. While it is frequently {{thought that he was}} the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef Čapek, as its actual inventor. In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he also explained that he had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the creatures laboři (from Latin labor, work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested roboti (robots in English).|$|E
25|$|According to Plutarch, Pericles faced, twice, serious accusations. The {{first one}} was just before the {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War and the second one was {{during the first year}} of the war, when he was punished with a fine, the amount of which was either fifteen or fifty talents. Before the war a bill was passed, on the motion of Dracontides, according to which Pericles should deposit his accounts of public moneys with the prytanes and the jurors should decide upon his case with ballots which had lain upon the altar of the goddess on the acropolis. This clause of the bill was however amended with the motion that the case be tried before fifteen hundred jurors in the ordinary way, whether one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it a prosecution for embezzlement and bribery, or malversation.|$|E

They took over a local garage – Ken Barrington Motors Ltd – in 1971, which sold Jaguar and Rover cars and proved to be a profitable enterprise.|$|E
