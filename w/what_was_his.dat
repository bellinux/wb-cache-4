5|$|The {{middle of}} 2005 saw Shearer reverse his {{decision}} to retire, after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness. He decided to continue playing in a player-coach capacity {{until the end of}} the following season. and he returned for one more season in the 2005–06 season. This last season saw him break Jackie Milburn's 49-year-old record of 200goals for Newcastle United (not including his 38 World War II Wartime League goals) when he netted his 201st strike in a home Premier League fixture against Portsmouth on 4 February 2006, becoming the club's highest-ever league and cup competition goalscorer with 206 goals altogether. On 17 April 2006, with three games remaining in his final season as a player, Shearer suffered a tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee after a collision during the 4–1 win at Sunderland in which he scored his 206th goal in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> 395th appearance for the club. The injury caused him to miss those final three games, effectively bringing forward his retirement. Shearer finished his final season with 10goals in 32 league games.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{returned}} to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog-shortened event. In the final 8-lap sprint, Richmond competed in a three-car battle with Geoff Bodine and Ricky Rudd. Richmond crossed {{the finish line}} beside Rudd, winning the race by 0.05 seconds. He notched four more victories that season, and over a span of twelve races, Richmond earned three second-place finishes, and six wins. The National Motorsports Press Association named him Co-Driver of the Year with Earnhardt after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10.

5|$|After Hayden's departure, Ponting {{was joined}} by Martyn, who {{completed}} his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two sixes off Harbhajan and one off Ashish Nehra. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At {{the end of the}} innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (off 121 balls; four fours and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the 2015 competition, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 extras. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> last international game.|$|E
5|$|During {{the truce}} of 1206–1208, John focused on {{building}} up his financial and military resources {{in preparation for}} another attempt to recapture Normandy. John used some of this {{money to pay for}} new alliances on Philip's eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern France's neighbours. By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, {{as well as with the}} counts Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou. Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his elder son, Louis, to invade Flanders with the intention of next launching an invasion of England. John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat. He launched his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme. The attack was a success, destroying Philip's vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year. John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but baronial discontent again delayed his invasion plans until early 1214, in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> final Continental campaign.|$|E

He recorded the first hat-trick in the Mariners' history in their 7–2 home win over Sydney FC on 3 November 2012, scoring {{in the first half}} with a penalty kick and in the second half with a close range finish and a header from Joshua Rose's cross. This marked the start of a run of 14 goals from 15 matches, helping the Mariners to second place in the 2012–13 A-League table and thus a place in the finals series. With 17 goals McBreen won the A-League Golden Boot, awarded to the division's top scorer. In the semi-final of the finals series he scored the only goal in the Mariner's 1–0 win over Melbourne Victory on 14 April 2013 with a powerful shot in the 42nd minute. One week later he scored the second goal with a 68th-minute penalty kick as the Mariners beat Western Sydney Wanderers 2–0 at Sydney Football Stadium in the 2013 A-League Grand Final. This {{was the first time the}} Mariners had won the A-League Championship, and McBreen was awarded the Joe Marston Medal, given to the man of the match of the Grand Final, before being named as a substitute in the PFA A-League Team of the Season. He made six appearances in the team's run to the round of 16 of the AFC Champions League, when they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao of the Chinese Super League.

5|$|Murray took a {{wildcard}} {{into the}} inaugural Shenzhen Open in China, entering {{as the number}} 2 seed. Victories over Somdev Devvarman, Lukáš Lacko and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon. In the final he faced Tommy Robredo of Spain, the second final between the two. After saving five championship {{points in the second}} set tie break, Murray {{went on to win the}} title in three sets, Robredo's drop in fitness ultimately proving decisive. He then took his good form into Beijing, where he reached the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets, however he lost in the third round at the Shanghai Masters to David Ferrer despite being a set up. Following his early exit in Shanghai, Murray took a wildcard into the Vienna Open in an attempt to claim a place at the ATP World Tour Finals. He reached the final, where he once again faced Ferrer, and triumphed in three sets for his second title of the season, and the 30th of his career. Murray defeated Ferrer again in the semifinals of the Valencia Open to move into his third final in five weeks, and further strengthen his bid for a place at the season finale in London. In a repeat of the Shenzhen Open final, Murray again saved five championship points as he overcame Tommy Robredo in three sets. Murray then went on to reach the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters, where he was eliminated by Djokovic in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> 23rd match in the space of only 37 days. However, his win over Dimitrov in the third round had already guaranteed him a spot at the ATP World Tour Finals.|$|E

Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again.

Moments later, Liverpool thought they had won a penalty when Kevin Keegan seemed to have been brought down by Berti Vogts, however the referee waved play on. Five {{minutes after the}}ir goal, Simonsen crossed the ball from the wing, it was met by Uli Stielike whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence. Two minutes later Liverpool regained the lead.

5|$|The Indians hired Bill McKechnie as a {{pitching}} coach after the 1946 season. One {{of his first}} jobs was to work with Gromek during the offseason and improve his pitching due to his struggles the prior year, in particular against left-handed batters. The Indians talked with the Yankees during the offseason about making a trade for second baseman Joe Gordon. The teams settled on Gromek as the main piece originally, but Joe DiMaggio suggested the team trade for Reynolds instead. Gromek remained on the Indians for the 1947 season as a result, but {{was moved to the}} bullpen instead of remaining in the starting rotation. The highlight of his season came on July 1 in relief of Feller, who left the game due to injury. In the game against the Browns, he threw 7.2 innings and allowed two runs in a 9–3 victory in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> longest appearance of the season at that time. For the year, Gromek pitched in 29 games, starting 7, and had a 2–5 record and a 3.74 ERA in 84.1 innings pitched, his first full season in which he pitched under 150 innings.|$|E
5|$|After {{meeting with}} the Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs, it was {{reported}} that Vlasic signed a two-year deal with the Chiefs in March, with Vlasic's agent confirming but Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson denying it. The Cowboys stated that they would not enter a bidding war, and the signing was confirmed shortly afterward. Vlasic spent the 1991 preseason competing with Steve Pelluer and Mike Elkins for the backup quarterback job. By the end of the preseason, both Pelluer and Elkins were cut, leaving Vlasic as the backup behind Steve DeBerg. He spent most of the season backing up DeBerg and getting occasional action. His most significant day as a backup came on November 17 against the Denver Broncos. Vlasic relieved DeBerg, who had thrown four interceptions, and completed nine of 14 passes for 91 yards and a touchdown in a 2420 loss. The highlight of Vlasic's season was a matchup on December 8 against his old team, the Chargers. After replacing DeBerg in the second half with the Chiefs down by 14 points, Vlasic completed 12 of 18 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown as the Chiefs beat the Chargers in overtime, 2017, and giving the Chiefs a playoff berth in the process. As a result of this performance, Vlasic was given the start for next week's game against the San Francisco 49ers. However, he sprained his knee in the second quarter, and did not play the final regular season game. Vlasic missed the wild card playoff game against the Oakland Raiders, but was available for the divisional playoff series against the Buffalo Bills. After DeBerg left in the second quarter due to injury, Vlasic entered the game in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> only playoff appearance. He completed nine of 20 passes for 124 yards and threw four interceptions in a 3714 blowout that marked the end of the Chiefs' playoff run. Vlasic's stats for 1991 were 28 completions in 44 attempts, 316 yards, two touchdowns, and a passer rating of 100.2.|$|E
