5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> the Democrats and another <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> the Republicans.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to reexamine, through a look at {{childcare}} support workers practice cases, analytical frameworks regarding ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. Much research has been performed so far using the theory of “Reflection” to discuss the role of practice in the ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. “Reflection” as used in previous research regarding those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study has treated formal educational as its area of analysis. Namely, there has been a tendency in research on ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study to employ the theory of “Reflection” to fixed-form course and training session situations. However, ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study occurs not only in formal learning settings alone. It is thought that the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills via the process of awareness, learning, and growing while supporting the learner amidst a relationship of praxis, also leads to the ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. Therefore, it is it is necessary to examine ability formation by examining not only approaches in formal settings in which courses and training have been set, and programs developed intentionally, for those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study, but also to widen one 2 ̆ 7 s view to include nonformal settings in which ability formation occurs as a natural result of daily practice. Based on this premise, this study seeks to clarify ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study in nonformal settings by focusing on workers involved in childcare support. My examination centers on interviews with such supporters to consider how their ability forms through daily interactions with parents and children. In interviewing, I invoked a “praxis daily life based” method of collaborative learning to clarify the study supporter 2 ̆ 7 s ability formation in nonformal settings...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} met in Limoges {{and then}} withdrew to Poitiers and Bordeaux, {{but as the}} French military situation deteriorated, became split over what should happen. The government was split between those <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> staying in France or staying with the French government and those <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> withdrawing to the United Kingdom. Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{increasing}} isolation from the majority of anti-war anarchists, George Woodcock notes that Kropotkin and anarchists <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> his position drew closer together in the months that preceded the Manifestos creation.

5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E

5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E
