500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E

500|$|The UK {{government}} had investigated expelling Bakri {{even before the}} terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and in July 2003 the headquarters of al-Muhajiroun, and the homes of Bakri and Choudary, were raided by the police. [...] The following year, under new anti-terrorist legislation, the government announced that it wanted to ban al-Muhajiroun. [...] In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers, and in August left the UK for Lebanon, where he claimed that he was on holiday. [...] After leaving a television station where he said [...] "I will not return to Britain unless I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> as a visitor or as a tourist", he was detained by Lebanon's general security department and held in a Beirut prison. [...] Several days later, Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on the grounds that his presence in Britain was [...] "not conducive to the public good." [...] Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban. [...] He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return. [...] In November Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon, and returned to the UK. [...] Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations, claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah.|$|E

2500|$|Trade rumours {{followed}} Kiprusoff as well, {{despite his}} reluctance to leave Calgary following {{the birth of}} his second child. The Flames gave the Toronto Maple Leafs permission to speak with Kiprusoff's agent to see if the team could convince the goaltender to accept a trade. [...] According to Feaster however, Kiprusoff told Toronto that [...] "Miikka was clear that he didn't want to lead Toronto on, that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> if his heart wasn't 100 per cent set on it and committed to it", therefore the Flames agreed to honour Kiprusoff's request to remain in Calgary.|$|E

You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1969, {{when the}} Beatles were recording/filming what became Let It Be, {{tensions}} became so acute that Harrison quit {{the group for}} several days, prompting the others to consider replacing him with Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to John Lennon. Michael Lindsay-Hogg, television director of the recording sessions for Let It Be, states, [...] "I was there when John mentioned Clapton—but that wasn't going to happen. Would Eric have become a Beatle? No. Paul didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> He didn't want them to break up. Then George came back." [...] Clapton was on good terms with {{all four of the}} Beatles; in December 1968 he had played with Lennon at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus as part of the one-off group the Dirty Mac.|$|E
