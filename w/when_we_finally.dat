25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

Gillian Anderson said, [...] "I never quite understood whether {{it was going to}} work or not. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> saw 'Triangle' after this new way of filming everything, a style that we'd never attempted before, as well as trying new scenes...trying this, trying that... that was terrific." [...] Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, [...] "One thing I really like about The X-Files was that they were always challenging themselves. Chris [...] would write an episode in which we're going to do Rope without any cuts, seemingly. A great challenge for a cast and crew." ...|$|E

[...] "A friend who heard the record recently said he now {{had no interest in}} listening to our older work anymore, that we had made all our old material redundant.

It is the only time a portrait of the band has appeared on the cover of one of their releases.

2500|$|After the Secret of the Runes tour, {{the band}} had amassed 55 {{unreleased}} songs {{which included the}} ones Johnsson had shelved as well as contributions from the Niemann brothers. Johnsson remarked that [...] "we went through the songs and realized that we had enough good material for three albums. Recording one after the other, promoting, and touring each one separately would have taken several years {{and would have been}} a bad idea; and being so productive, we would have had another 55 songs waiting <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> came to the end of it." [...] In 2004, the band released 21 tracks on two albums: Lemuria and Sirius B. The albums were released simultaneously and were available as separate albums or a twin-pack. 171 musicians participated, including the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and a 32-member choir. Contributing to lead vocals were Mats Levén and a returning Piotr Wawrzeniuk.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
5000|$|While not {{accepting}} the full, radical approach of Maier, I {{think we can}} agree with him on one basic point: in the earliest rabbinic sources, {{there is no clear}} or even probable reference to Jesus of Nazareth. Furthermore, ... <b>when</b> <b>we</b> do <b>finally</b> find such references in later rabbinic literature, they are most probably reactions to Christian claims, oral or written.|$|R

5000|$|Reviews for Tattoo You {{were largely}} positive, proclaiming the album {{a return to}} form and ranking among the Rolling Stones' finest works. Debra Rae Cohen commented in Rolling Stone: [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>we</b> might <b>finally</b> have lost patience, the new record dances (not prances), rocks (not jives) onto the scene, and the Rolling Stones are back again, with a matter-of-fact {{acceptance}} of their continued existence - and eventual mortality …" ...|$|R

40|$|Digital media users may be easy {{to track}} {{but they can be}} very hard to follow, writes Jock Given in Inside Story • “The Net… is different,” wrote Randall Rothenberg in Wired in January 1998. “The Net is accountable. It is knowable. It is the highway leading {{marketers}} to their Holy Grail: single-sourcing technology that can definitively tie the information consumers perceive to the purchases they make. ” What we have learned in the decade-and-a-half since is that some of what happens on the internet is much more accountable. Newspapers, for example, have learned which of their stories attract online readers in a way they never knew offline. Digital technology has given us many better tools to measure what people are doing with media. But it has also enabled people to do new things with media that are incredibly hard to measure reliably. Audiences and users may have become less knowable at precisely the moment <b>when</b> <b>we</b> thought <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> had the technology to pin them down. Some extraordinary machines have been built to drive that highway to the marketers’ Holy Grail, but the road still winds on and uphill… Read the full article Photo: Nicole Emanuel/ The Ag...|$|R

The boat had 'smelt' the bar in good earnest; the foamy ridges that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared, a great dead swell came rolling forward and swept ahead of her, she careened far over to larboard, and went tearing away toward the other shore as if she were about scared to death.

She knew no fear, being one of those enviable folk who can because they think they can. One hundred and twenty miles of half-flooded prairie trail--camping out at night in the solitude of the Great Lone Land--rain--muskegs--Indian guides--nothing had any terror for my dauntless cousin.|$|E

Even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.|$|E
500|$|Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum. He {{considered}} {{making the}} former but {{was worried about}} similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because {{it was a lot}} more graphic and in the second place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did <b>finally</b> make Masque of the Red Death we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it." ...|$|R

I believe that the Polish people should know those who govern them, including those who helped the UB and SB to keep Poles enslaved. I believe the collaborators of the former communist political police constitute a threat to the security of the free Polish people.

At first she frightened me; but presently I was aware that she was quite as safe here as was I. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> came to my ledge and I again held her in my arms, she recalled to my mind that for several weeks she had been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of hatchet-men. They had been driven from their former caves by another tribe which had slain many and carried off quite half the females, and the new cliffs to which they had flown had proven far higher and more precipitous, so that she had become, through necessity, a most practiced climber.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{we changed}} a direct descent to work {{gradually}} along the slopes toward a great level bench covered with pines. We {{had to cross}} gravel patches and pits where avalanches had slid, and at last, gaining the bench {{we went through the}} pine grove, out to a manzanita thicket, to a rocky point where the ledges were toppling and dangerous. The stand here afforded a magnificent view. We were now down in the thick of this sloped and canyoned and timbered wildness; no longer above it, and aloof from it. The dry smell of pine filled the air. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> halted to listen we at once heard the baying of the hounds in the black notch below us. We watched and listened. And presently across open patches we saw the flash of deer, and then Rock and Buck following them. Thus were my suspicions of Rock fully confirmed. Copple yelled down to Edd that some of the hounds were running deer, but apparently Edd was too far away to hear.|$|E
60|$|Of Cornish {{hospitality}} {{we experienced}} many proofs, {{one of which}} may be related as a sample. Arriving late at a village, in the far west of the county, we found some difficulty in arousing the people of the inn. While we were waiting at the door, we heard a man who lived in a cottage near at hand, and of whom we had asked our way on the road, inquiring of some female member of his family, whether she could make up a spare bed. We had met this man proceeding in our direction, and had so far outstripped him in walking, that we had been waiting outside the inn about {{a quarter of an hour}} before he got home. When the woman answered his question in the negative, he directed her to put clean sheets on his own bed, and then came out to tell us that if we failed to obtain admission at the public-house, a lodging for the night was ready for us under his own roof. We found on inquiry, afterwards, that he had looked out of window, after getting home, while we were still disturbing the village by a continuous series of assaults on the inn door; had recognised us in the moonlight; and had thereupon not only offered us his bed, but had got out of it himself to do so. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> succeeded in gaining admittance to the inn, he declined an invitation to sup with us, and wishing us a good night's rest, returned to his home. I should mention, at the same time, that another bed was offered to us at the vicarage, by the clergyman of the parish; and that after this gentleman had himself seen that we were properly accommodated by our landlady, he left us with an invitation to breakfast with him the next morning. Thus is hospitality practised in Cornwall--a county where, it must be remembered, a stranger is doubly a stranger, in relation to provincial sympathies; where the national feeling is almost entirely merged in the local feeling; where a man speaks of himself as Cornish in much the same spirit as a Welshman speaks of himself as Welsh.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} a sense of {{greatest}} relief that I stood {{near the edge of the}} scuttle wiping the perspiration from my face <b>when</b> <b>finally</b> <b>we</b> had got the scoundrelly cur where we wanted him, and then the satisfaction which should have been mine because of having thus far succeeded in holding our own, was entirely wiped out by thoughts of the future.

60|$|About {{this time}} a dispute arose as to whether we should attempt to prevent the Black Kendah from {{crossing}} the river which was now running down, a plan {{that some of the}} elders favoured. At last the controversy was referred to me as head general and I decided against anything of the sort. It seemed to me that our force was too small, and that if I took the rifle-men a great deal of ammunition might be expended with poor result. Also in the event of any reverse or <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>finally</b> driven back, which must happen, there might be difficulty about remounting the camels, our only means of escape from the horsemen who would possibly gallop us down. Moreover the Tava had several fords, any one of which might be selected by the enemy. So it was arranged that we should make our first and last stand upon the Holy Mount.|$|R
