25|$|For {{any given}} level of {{clinical}} impairment, {{there is a}} higher degree of neuropathological change in the brains of those Alzheimer's disease sufferers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> greater number of activities. This is true even when education and IQ are controlled for. This suggests that differences in lifestyle may increase cognitive reserve by making the individual more resilient. Mortimer et al. performed cognitive testing on a population of 678 nuns in 1997, in which they showed that different levels of cognitive activity and performance were possible in patients diagnosed with Alzheimers. One subject showing reduced neocortical plaques survived with mild deficits, despite (or due to) low brain weight.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that {{men are more likely}} to engage in extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are {{more likely to engage in}} extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E
