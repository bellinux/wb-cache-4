25|$|Indirect Object Pronouns {{are used}} as a suffix after the verb and before the ش- -š of the negation. When there is a {{combination}} of direct and indirect object pronouns, indirect object pronouns are always written in the end. Furthermore, the first short i for the indirect Object pronoun is always dropped <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> after a vowel.|$|E
25|$|SQL Server buffers {{pages in}} RAM to {{minimize}} disk I/O. Any 8KB page can be buffered in-memory, and {{the set of}} all pages currently buffered is called the buffer cache. The amount of memory available to SQL Server decides how many pages will be cached in memory. The buffer cache is managed by the Buffer Manager. Either reading from or writing to any page copies it to the buffer cache. Subsequent reads or writes are redirected to the in-memory copy, rather than the on-disc version. The page is updated on the disc by the Buffer Manager only if the in-memory cache has not been referenced for some time. While writing pages back to disc, asynchronous I/O is used whereby the I/O operation is done in a background thread so that other operations {{do not have to}} wait for the I/O operation to complete. Each page is written along with its checksum <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written.</b> When reading the page back, its checksum is computed again and matched with the stored version to ensure the page has not been damaged or tampered with in the meantime.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{an option}} will rarely be exactly at the money, except for <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> (when one may {{buy or sell}} an ATM option), one may speak informally of an option being near the money or close to the money. Similarly, given {{standardized}} options (at a fixed set of strikes, say every $1), one can speak of which one is nearest the money; [...] "near the money" [...] may narrowly refer specifically to the nearest the money strike. Conversely, one may speak informally of an option being far from the money.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mathematical}} analysis originated in {{observations of the}} behaviour of game equipment such as playing cards and dice, which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of indifference. [...] This {{is not the only}} way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that [...] "it will probably rain", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. [...] Likewise, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> that [...] "the most probable explanation" [...] of the name of Ludlow, Massachusetts [...] "is that it was named after Roger Ludlow", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.|$|E

2500|$|The northwestern dialect {{is known}} by pronouncing r as [...] <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> before an ā or ū. Furthermore, {{it is known}} for the {{substitution}} of [...] by [...] when it comes {{at the beginning of}} a word and when that word contains [...] or [...] in its middle or end. Also, it is known for the pronunciation of ū and ī respectively as [...] and [...] when they are in an emphatic or uvular environment. As well, northwestern dialect is known for using مش miš that is pronounced as [...] instead of مانيش mānīš to mean the negation of future predicted action. Similarly, the conjugation of مش miš as a modal verb uses مشني mišnī instead of مانيش mānīš, مشك mišk instead of ماكش mākš, مشّو miššū instead of موش mūš and ماهوش māhūš, مشها mišhā instead of ماهيش māhīš, مشنا mišnā instead of ماناش mānāš, مشكم miškum instead of ماكمش mākumš and مشهم mišhum instead of ماهمش māhumš. Moreover, northwestern dialect is known for the use of نحنا naḥnā instead of أحنا aḥnā as a plural second person personal pronoun and the southern area of this Tunisian dialect like El Kef is known for the use of ناي nāy or ناية nāya instead of آنا ānā (meaning I) excepting Kairouan that is known for using يانة yāna in this situation.|$|E

50|$|An educated {{reading of}} the biblical text {{requires}} knowledge of <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written,</b> by whom, and for what purpose. For example, many academics would agree that the Pentateuch was in existence some time shortly after the 6th century BCE, but they disagree about <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>written.</b> Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One popular hypothesis points to the reign of Josiah (7th century BCE). In this hypothesis, the events of, for example, Exodus would have happened centuries before they were finally edited. This topic is expanded upon in dating the Bible.|$|R

60|$|If {{you are now}} {{satisfied}} that The Rhine Gold is an allegory, do not forget that an allegory is never quite consistent except <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> by someone without dramatic faculty, in which case it is unreadable. There {{is only one way}} of dramatizing an idea; and that is by putting on the stage a human being possessed by that idea, yet none the less a human being with all the human impulses which make him akin and therefore interesting to us. Bunyan, in his Pilgrim's Progress, does not, like his unread imitators, attempt to personify Christianity and Valour: he dramatizes for you the life of the Christian and the Valiant Man. Just so, though I have shown that Wotan is Godhead and Kingship, and Loki Logic and Imagination without living Will (Brain without Heart, to put it vulgarly); yet in the drama Wotan is a religiously moral man, and Loki a witty, ingenious, imaginative and cynical one. As to Fricka, who stands for State Law, she does not assume her allegorical character in The Rhine Gold at all, but is simply Wotan's wife and Freia's sister: nay, she contradicts her allegorical self by conniving at all Wotan's rogueries. That, of course, is just what State Law would do; but we must not save the credit of the allegory by a quip. Not until she reappears in the next play (The Valkyries) does her function in the allegorical scheme become plain.|$|E
60|$|XXIV. I am grieved to have {{to insist}} upon what seems so simple; it looks trite and commonplace <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>written,</b> but pardon me this: for it is {{anything}} but an accepted or understood principle in practice, and the less excusably forgotten, because it is, of all the great and true laws of art, the easiest to obey. The executive facility of complying with its demands cannot be too earnestly, too frankly asserted. There are not five men in the kingdom who could compose, not twenty who could cut, the foliage with which the windows of Or San Michele are adorned; but there is many a village clergyman who could invent and dispose its black openings, and not a village mason who could not cut them. Lay a few clover or wood-roof leaves on white paper, and a little alteration in their positions will suggest figures which, cut boldly through a slab of marble, would be worth more window traceries than an architect could draw in a summer's day. There are few {{men in the world}} who could design a Greek capital; there are few who could not produce some vigor of effect with leaf designs on Byzantine block: few who could design a Palladian front, or a flamboyant pediment; many who could build a square mass like the Strozzi palace. But I know not how it is, unless that our English hearts have more oak than stone in them, and have more filial sympathy with acorns than Alps; but all that we do is small and mean, if not worse--thin, and wasted, and unsubstantial. It is not modern work only; we have built like frogs and mice since the thirteenth century (except only in our castles). What a contrast between the pitiful little pigeon-holes which stand for doors in the east front of Salisbury, looking like the entrances to a beehive or a wasp's nest, and the soaring arches and kingly crowning of the gates of Abbeville, Rouen, and Rheims, or the rock-hewn piers of Chartres, or the dark and vaulted porches and writhed pillars of Verona! Of domestic architecture what need is there to speak? How small, how cramped, how poor, how miserable in its petty neatness is our best! how beneath the mark of attack, and the level of contempt, that which is common with us! What a strange sense of formalised deformity, of shrivelled precision, of starved accuracy, of minute misanthropy have we, as we leave even the rude streets of Picardy for the market towns of Kent! Until that street architecture of ours is bettered, until we give it some size and boldness, until we give our windows recess, and our walls thickness, I know not how we can blame our architects for their feebleness in more important work; their eyes are inured to narrowness and slightness: can we expect them at a word to conceive and deal with breadth and solidity? They ought not to live in our cities; there is that in their miserable walls which bricks up to death men's imaginations, as surely as ever perished forsworn nun. An architect should live as little in cities as a painter. Send him to our hills, and let him study there what nature understands by a buttress, and what by a dome. There was something in the old power of architecture, which it had from the recluse more than from the citizen. The buildings of which I have spoken with chief praise, rose, indeed, out of the war of the piazza, and above the fury of the populace: and Heaven forbid that for such cause we should ever have to lay a larger stone, or rivet a firmer bar, in our England! But we have other sources of power, in the imagery of our iron coasts and azure hills; of power more pure, nor less serene, than that of the hermit spirit which once lighted with white lines of cloisters the glades of the Alpine pine, and raised into ordered spires the wild rocks of the Norman sea; which gave to the temple gate the depth and darkness of Elijah's Horeb cave; and lifted, out of the populous city, grey cliffs of lonely stone, into the midst of sailing birds and silent air.|$|E
