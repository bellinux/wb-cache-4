25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} political application of social media is Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008. It {{was the first of}} its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forever more in the ever-changing technological world <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> today. His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos. Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook. Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80 million views.|$|E

He argued that Greece needed something similar to the Marshall Plan, with a payment scheme that took into account {{the strength of the}} economy. He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People say that we are responsible for the situation <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in.</b> OK, sure. But I think that Germany will find it hard to argue that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E

A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republicans, he became a generous donor to ThomasE.Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency. In 1946 he was {{a founding member of}} the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated they [...] "believ in, and like, the American Way of Life... <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life". In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|The Multiverse {{hypothesis}} proposes {{the existence}} of many universes with different physical constants, {{some of which are}} hospitable to intelligent life (see [...] ). Because we are intelligent beings, it is unsurprising that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> a hospitable universe {{if there is such a}} multiverse. The Multiverse hypothesis is therefore thought to provide an elegant explanation of the finding that we exist despite the required fine-tuning. (See [...] for a detailed discussion of the arguments for and against this suggested explanation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Hawking, {{along with}} Thomas Hertog of CERN, {{proposed}} that the Universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, {{only a small fraction}} of which contributed to the conditions we see today. According to their theory, it is inevitable that we find our Universe's [...] "fine-tuned" [...] physical constants, as the current Universe [...] "selects" [...] only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.|$|E

In this piece, Marcos compares and contrasts the Third World War (the Cold War) with the Fourth World War, which he says is the new type of war that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> now: [...] "If the Third World War saw the confrontation of capitalism and socialism on various terrains and {{with varying degrees of}} intensity, the fourth will be played out between large financial centers, on a global scale, and at a tremendous and constant intensity."

2500|$|The {{three great}} results of {{psychological}} observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason. [...] These three facts {{are different in}} character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or {{the facts of the}} sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> a strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.|$|E
