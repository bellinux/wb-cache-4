25|$|Esperanto has not {{fragmented}} into regional dialects through {{natural language}} use. This {{may be because}} it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and jargon have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication – the <b>whole</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> Esperanto – and so have generally been avoided.|$|E

One of our central conclusions is that the system of education in Africa in general, and higher education in particular, is highly dysfunctional, especially in terms of wasted human capacity as well as financial resources. African higher education institutions cannot close their eyes to the immense skills shortage and the frightening percentages of (youth-) unemployment. This leads to the recommendation that the responsibilities of a university concerning the generation of relevant new knowledge, preparing students adequately as active citizens for the challenges in the labour market, contributing to the development of communities, and fostering critical thinking need to be given high priority. </p...|$|R

50|$|In the {{foundational}} approach of André Weil, developed in his Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, generic points {{played an important}} role, but were handled in a different manner.

This approach worked, without any need to deal directly with the topology of V (K-Zariski topology, that is), because the specializations could all be discussed at the field level (as in the valuation theory approach to algebraic geometry, popular in the 1930s).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} anesthesia {{recovery and}} hemodynamic status in patients under thiopental infusion or halothane maintenance anesthesia undergoing ocular surgery. Methods: Fifty-nine voluntary patients undergoing ocular surgery in Farabi hospital were allocated {{to one of}} two maintenance anesthesia groups: inhaled halothane, 0. 8 to 1 per cent, (group I, n= 37) and thiopental infusion, 10 to 12 mg/kg/hour, (group II, n= 22). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at the time of patient entrance to the operation room and at the 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 minutes following anesthesia. Anesthesia recovery variables were also compared between the two groups. Results: In group I, arterial blood pressure at 10 to 40 min and heart rate at 1 and 25 min after the administration of anesthetics were significantly lower when compared with group II (W- 2 = 25. 10, p= 0. 005).

At CRYPTO 2009, Icart [5] introduced a deterministic function Fq → E(Fq) {{which can be}} computed efficiently, and allowed him and Coron [3] to define well-behaved hash functions with values in E(Fq). Some properties of this function rely on a conjecture which was left as an open problem in [5]. We prove this conjecture below as well as analogues for other hash functions. This allows us to prove that a related function is surjective, which {{is a first step}} towards efficient hashing to the <b>whole</b> set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> {{elliptic curve}}s.
