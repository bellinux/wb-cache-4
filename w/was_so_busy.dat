[...] There McCain debated second-tier candidates Alan Keyes, Orrin Hatch, and Steve Forbes instead. [...] Bush finally did participate in the December6 debate from the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix, by which time McCain <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> campaigning in New Hampshire {{that he had to}} join via a video linkup. [...] There McCain's signature push for campaign finance reform led to one of the few lively exchanges in an otherwise placid event.|$|E
500|$|... he {{narrative}} evolved out of Haley's {{interviews with}} Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, {{and had made}} interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, {{at least in the}} earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.|$|E

500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} officially {{in the scientific}} literature by English mycologist Miles Berkeley in an 1873 publication. Berkeley obtained the specimens from Moses Ashley Curtis, which had in turn been sent to him by Ravenel from collections he made at the Santee River in South Carolina in 1846. Although the specimen had been sent with Ravenel's extensive collection notes, Berkeley's description was brief, and he neglected to mention the veil. American Curtis Gates Lloyd later disparaged the quality of Berkeley's description, and noted [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> {{that he could not}} take the time to consider the details, and his [...] "description" [...] tells nothing of the leading characters of the species." [...] Charles Horton Peck, upon encountering the fungus in North America, could not identify it using Berkeley's description, and instead had to contact Ravenel to obtain his original collection notes before he could confirm its identity. Peck later wrote a full description of the species. In 1898, Edward Angus Burt placed the taxon in the genus Dictyophora, based on the presence of the veil. Otto Kuntze transferred the taxon to the genus Aedycia (now equivalent with Mutinus), resulting in the synonym Aedycia ravenelii. The mushroom is commonly known as the eastern stinkhorn or Ravenel's stinkhorn.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} story in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> that it risked running awry, but was kept together {{by a number of}} strong comedic moments and subplots. Pierce particularly enjoyed watching the parks department scrambling to do Leslie's work, and the chemistry between both April and Andy, and Leslie and Dave. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said he [...] "thoroughly enjoyed" [...] the episode, especially the subplot of the parks department employees realizing how much work Leslie does due to her absence. However, he said way the sex scandal consumed the entire town and local media countered the central conceit of the series, [...] "that Leslie treats her mundane, small-town civil service job {{as if it were a}} high-stakes national politics job, while everyone else sees their world for what it is". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was [...] "a sweet and clever way to celebrate the holiday season", but that the media frenzy in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was [...] "a little out of place in an episode filled with a ton of subtler, character-building moments". Fowler said the parks department employees splitting up to do Leslie's work was [...] "a great element" [...] that helped develop Leslie's character.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could {{only be described as}} shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even heard he was retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E

In fact, the journey came to embrace Norway almost exclusively. Returning to Gothenburg after several months, he sent his report to the Department of State, an excerpt of it reads: ...|$|E

2500|$|Development of Advance Wars began {{alongside}} the Game Boy Advance launch titles; however, because Nintendo <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> with them, they requested that Intelligent Systems {{assist in the}} development. Director Makoto Shimojo commented that {{the early stages of}} development often feature Intelligent Systems coming up with unique game mechanics for it, and upon presenting to Nintendo, typically being told that it was [...] "too sophisticated" [...] or [...] "not balanced for a general audience". At which point, they began working on adjustments. The game was designed with the Game Boy Advance's young children audience, giving the game a [...] "pop design", with bright colors, rounded characters, and comedy. Shimojo commented that in spite of this, the majority of purchasers were teenage boys. In order to cope with bringing a strategy game to a handheld with a younger audience, Shimojo and his team made the game featuring [...] "waves of excitement"; he compared this to how long films will introduce calm periods in order to have good pacing.|$|E
2500|$|Shrove Tuesday {{was once}} known as a [...] "half-holiday" [...] in Britain. It started at 11:00am with the ringing of a church bell. On Pancake Day, [...] "pancake races" [...] are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The {{tradition}} {{is said to have}} originated in 1445 when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her frying pan and pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning. The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England. Participants with frying pans race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan while running. The pancake race at Olney traditionally has women contestants who carry a frying pan and race over a 415-yard course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants must toss the pancake at the start and the finish, and wear a scarf and apron.|$|E
2500|$|The 1930s and 1940s {{were the}} Golden Age {{of radio and}} there were {{significant}} financial rewards {{to be made for}} those writing for radio comedy programs. Phil Baker, for whom Block was the head writer, reportedly spent $1,500 per week on his three writers, equivalent to $24,000 in 2010 dollars. However, the failure rate of those attempting to make it a career was high. Despite the risk, and against his father's expressed wishes, in 1935 Block abandoned [...] the study of law and moved to New York City. He was able to achieve immediate success, being hired by the [...] comedy team of Abbott and Costello. He also continued to write for Phil Baker, for whom he would write even into the 1940s, including Baker's hit game show, The $64,000 Question. By 1937, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> as a writer that in September he only had three hours to stop off in Chicago for his parent's anniversary party before continuing by train to Hollywood, writing for Baker's radio show. In the years that followed, Block would establish his reputation by writing for many of the top comedians in radio, including Bob Hope, Burns and Allen, Eddie Cantor, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Milton Berle.|$|E

2500|$|While {{writing a}} poem about God one day he was {{interrupted}} by the visit of a business acquaintance who {{expressed an interest in}} his activity, perhaps because he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>busy</b> typing. Mr. Chase read a portion of what he was writing and he was astounded when his friend told him that he had recently come upon a man who had declared that God had “walked upon the earth.” Immediately Mr. Chase expressed interest and asked to be conducted to this person. Chase was then put in touch with Ibrahim George Kheiralla, recently immigrated to the United States and the second Bahá'í in America after Anton Haddad. A small group began to study the religion with Kheiralla. Stockman indicates that 5 June 1894 was probably the day the class began. A week later he was noted in Pueblo, CO, and then attended a memorial observance for Bunker Hill back in Chicago. Chase's status as a Bahá'i is accepted pointing to this time though several others accepted the new religion before him, but did not stay with the religion. Thus Chase should be considered the first American to become and remain a Bahá'í, and not the first American Bahá'í chronologically. In January 1897 his speech at an insurance agents convention was described as [...] "beautiful…, bright and sublime in its imagery", about attaining to noble ideals above [...] "killing time". In February Chase used an editorial commending of the insurance agent association for [...] "inviting men in various walks of life to its banquets to speak to the members on topics that inspire, elevate, and encourage", and expands on the theme, quoting his words: ...|$|E
