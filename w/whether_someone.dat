50|$|Indian {{religions}} {{are known to}} have co-existed and evolved together for many centuries before the arrival of Islam in the 12th century, followed by Mughal and colonial era. Ashoka about 2200 years ago, Harsha about 1400 years ago accepted and patronised different religions. The people in ancient South Asia had freedom of religion, and the state granted citizenship to each individual regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>someone’s</b> religion was Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or any other. Ellora cave temples built next to each other between 5th and 10th centuries, for example, shows a coexistence of religions and a spirit of acceptance of different faiths.|$|R

25|$|Person-positivity bias is the {{tendency}} to evaluate an object more favorably the more the object resembles an individual human being. Generally, the more a comparison target resembles a specific person, the more familiar it will be. However, groups of people {{are considered to be}} more abstract concepts, which leads to less favorable judgments. With regards to the optimistic bias, when people compare themselves to an average person, <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> of the same sex or age, the target continues to be viewed as less human and less personified, which will result in less favorable comparisons between the self and others.|$|E

Who owned the home and <b>whether</b> <b>someone's</b> ex-partner moved in upon partnership formation are of prime importance to whether a separated person moves. Furthermore, separated persons whose parents live nearby and those who {{have a long history of}} living in the same municipality have a smaller probability of moving than other separated persons...|$|R

25|$|Since {{most cases}} of AF are {{secondary}} to other medical problems, {{the presence of}} chest pain or angina, {{signs and symptoms of}} hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) such as weight loss and diarrhea, and symptoms suggestive of lung disease can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, or rheumatic fever may indicate <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> with AF is at a higher risk of complications. The risk of a blood clot forming in the left atrium, breaking off, and then traveling in the bloodstream can be assessed using the CHADS2 score or CHA2DS2-VASc score.|$|E
25|$|When the {{shelling}} stopped, the police entered the village on 12 August. OSCE observers could hear gunfire and explosions {{coming from inside}} the village. Three people {{were killed by the}} police inside the village, and four were killed while trying to escape by snipers located in positions outside the village. Around one hundred men from the village were arrested by the police and taken to the neighbouring village of Mirkovci, where they were subjected to the paraffin glove test (a test used to determine <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> has recently shot a firearm.) Twenty-seven men tested positive and were detained and sentenced for terrorism. The rest were released. Evidence later indicated that the detainees were subjected to severe beatings, as a result of which one person had to be hospitalised.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{corruption}} of minors statute against adults corrupting the morals of minors under 18 years of age. However, the corruption of minors statute only applies to perpetrators 18 {{years of age and}} older, so it is always legal for minors 16-17 to have sex with each other but not always with a partner 18 or older. Pennsylvania prosecutors use this law against adults who have consensual intercourse with 16- and 17-year-olds, and it would count as a misdemeanor offense. In 2005 JoAnne Epps, a former prosecutor and Temple University Beasley School of Law dean of academic affairs, stated that the corruption of minors charge {{is considered to be a}} separate crime from that of statutory rape; she stated that the consideration of whether a minor is consenting to sexual activity is a separate issue from <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> is corrupting the minor's morals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>someone's</b> {{belief is}} true {{is not a}} {{prerequisite}} for (its) belief. On the other hand, if something is actually known, then it categorically cannot be false. For example, if a person believes that a bridge is safe enough to support him, and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under his weight, {{it could be said}} that he believed that the bridge was safe but that his belief was mistaken. It would not be accurate to say that he knew that the bridge was safe, because plainly it was not. By contrast, if the bridge actually supported his weight, then he might say that he had believed that the bridge was safe, whereas now, after proving it to himself (by crossing it), he knows it was safe.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{sources of}} {{variation}} have been understood in discrete categories, such as age, height, weight, gender, geographical region (altitude), and race or ethnicity. Global {{efforts have been}} made in the early 20th century to standardize these sources to enable proper diagnosis and accurate evaluation of pulmonary function. However, rather than further aiming to understand the causes of such variations, the primary approach for dealing with observed differences in lung capacity has been to “correct for” them. Utilizing results from comparative population studies, attributes are empirically factored together into a “correction factor.” This number is then utilized to form a personalized ‘reference value’ that defines what is considered normal for one individual. Practitioners may thereby find the percent deviation from this predicted value, known as ‘percent of predicted,’ and determine <b>whether</b> <b>someone’s</b> lung function is abnormally poor or excellent.|$|R

North Carolina, which held that age is relevant to determining if someone is in custody).

500|$|The first device {{has been}} {{approved}} by the courts: in Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts, Lord Denning allowed the court and trustees to engage a Chief Rabbi to determine whether a beneficiary's wife was [...] "of the Jewish faith" [...] which determined the beneficiary's eligibility to the trust. Though this condition was conceptually uncertain, owing to the court's inability to determine with certainty <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> is of a particular faith, the trust document explicitly set out that a Chief Rabbi could determine it.

40|$|Changing someone's {{opinion is}} arguably {{one of the}} most {{important}} challenges of social interaction. The underlying process proves difficult to study: it is hard to know how someone's opinions are formed and <b>whether</b> and how <b>someone's</b> views shift. Fortunately, ChangeMyView, an active community on Reddit, provides a platform where users present their own opinions and reasoning, invite others to contest them, and acknowledge when the ensuing discussions change their original views. In this work, we study these interactions to understand the mechanisms behind persuasion. We find that persuasive arguments are characterized by interesting patterns of interaction dynamics, such as participant entry-order and degree of back-and-forth exchange. Furthermore, by comparing similar counterarguments to the same opinion, we show that language factors play an essential role. In particular, the interplay between the language of the opinion holder and that of the counterargument provides highly predictive cues of persuasiveness. Finally, since even in this favorable setting people may not be persuaded, we investigate the problem of determining <b>whether</b> <b>someone's</b> opinion is susceptible to being changed at all. For this more difficult task, we show that stylistic choices in how the opinion is expressed carry predictive power.

500|$|For Georgian England, {{the story}} of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. [...] Little {{attention}} was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to [...] "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). [...] The author Kristina Straub compares {{the case with the}} more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a [...] "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or [...] "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". [...] The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal [...] "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". [...] Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather [...] "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order."

500|$|Coming {{after two}} episodes {{focused on the}} series' [...] "mythology", or fictional history, [...] "Squeeze" [...] helped {{establish}} that the show could cover other paranormal subjects, {{and was the first}} [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episode of The X-Files. Series creator Chris Carter thought that the show could not sustain its momentum unless it branched out from the previously UFO-centered plots. Co-writers Glen Morgan and James Wong were inspired to write the episode when they looked at a ventilation shaft outside of their office and thought about <b>whether</b> <b>someone</b> could crawl inside it. Although the episode has parallels with the second [...] film, The Night Strangler (1973), which featured a man who commits murders every 21 years, Morgan and Wong have stated they were inspired by the serial killers Jack the Ripper and Richard Ramirez. After eating foie gras during a trip to France, Carter proposed the idea that the villain should consume human livers. Morgan noted that the writers settled on the liver because it was [...] "funnier" [...] than any other organ. The idea to have Tooms use a nest for hibernation came from Morgan and Wong; they liked that if the agents were unable to catch Tooms, he could return after weeks of dormancy.|$|E
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience.

40|$|Responding {{to reports}} of missing persons {{represents}} one of the biggest demands on the resources of police organisations. In the UK, for example, it is estimated that over 300, 000 missing persons incidents are recorded by the police each year which means that a person in the UK is recorded missing by the police approximately every two minutes. However, there is a complex web of behaviours that surround the phenomenon of missing persons which can make it difficult to establish <b>whether</b> <b>someone’s</b> disappearance is ‘intentional’ or ‘unintentional’ or whether they might be at risk of harm from themselves or others. Drawing on a set of missing person case reconstructions and interviews with the officers involved with these cases, this paper provides insights into the different stages of the investigative process and some of the key influences which shape the trajectory of a missing person’s investigation. In particular, it highlights the complex interplay between actions which are ‘ordered and conditioned’ by a procedural discourse around how missing persons investigations should be conducted, and the narratives that officers construct about how they approach investigations which are often shaped by a mix of police craft, ‘science’ and ‘reputational’ issues...|$|R
