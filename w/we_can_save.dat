While performing in the theater he's known to become emotional and challenge the audience. Kershaw addressed the country of El Salvador on national news across 7 million homes bringing together congressional leaders and administration officials in hopes to furnish clean water to communities. On December 30, 2014 Kershaw hung water paintings on corners of rural villages and W.U. Caribbean Magazine claimed an immediate impact on rural communities and they stated Kershaw's energy spread and his light shined bright on the world water crisis. The Caribbean's Drive Time Radio Show publicized Kershaw's clean water campaign and recorded him speaking out against the lack of sanitation in rural communities and he said, “If everybody stops {{going to the bathroom}} right now then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> lives, but that’s never going to happen.” Kershaw was called 'He No Faking Jamaican' for his activism in the Caribbean.|$|E

There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art {{can go a long}} way." [...] Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture's potential.|$|E

2500|$|Facing a {{coalition}} which included Austria, France, Russia, Saxony and Sweden, and having only Great Britain, Hesse, Brunswick, and Hanover as his allies, Frederick narrowly kept Prussia {{in the war}} despite having his territories repeatedly invaded. He suffered some severe defeats himself and was frequently at the last gasp, but always managed to recover. Prussia's position became even more desperate when Britain (having made gains in India and the Americas) ended their financial support for Prussia {{after the death of}} King George II, Frederick's uncle. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> from the avidity of my enemies". [...] With the Russians slowly advancing towards Berlin, it looked as though Prussia was about to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} of 1761 {{was almost as}} abortive as the {{campaign of}} 1760. Frederick acted on the defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian fortress of Kolberg on Christmas Day 1761, by Rumyantsev, was the sole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762 he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> from the avidity of my enemies," [...] which means, if words mean anything, that he was resolved to seek a soldier's death on the first opportunity. A fortnight later he wrote to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, [...] "The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear fellow. I have received the news of a great event." [...] The great event which snatched him from destruction was {{the death of the}} Russian empress (5 January 1762 (N.S.)).|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel's {{previous}} {{statements on}} rationing {{were about the}} [...] "allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines" [...] such as who should get a [...] "liver for transplantation". Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television. In 1994 Emanuel said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, [...] "Just because we are spending a lot of money on patients who die does not mean that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> a lot of money on end of life care." ...|$|E
