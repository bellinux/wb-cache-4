5|$|The tank used in {{the film}} is a {{modified}} M5A1 Stuart. It was purchased from the government of Peru about twelve years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for Tank Girl, the tank's 37mm anti-tank gun <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> modified flag pole to {{give the appearance of}} a 105mm gun. An entire 1969 Cadillac Eldorado was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the fender welded to the front.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles {{were found on the}} floor of the kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{is said to}} {{have been}} found {{enclosed}} in a wooden box in a dry cave in the highlands of Chiapas near Tortuguero; it was said to have been found with a turquoise mask that is now in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks. In 1965 Mexican collector Dr. Josué Sáenz was taken by two men on a light plane to a remote airstrip in the foothills of the Sierra Madre near Tortuguero in Tabasco state; the compass of the plane <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cloth but Sáenz recognized his approximate location. At the airstrip he was shown the codex along with some other looted Maya artifacts and was told that he could take the items back to Mexico City for authentication before purchasing them. The antiquities expert that Sáenz consulted declared that the artifacts were fakes but Sáenz later purchased the codex and permitted Michael Coe to display the codex at the Grolier Club in 1971. In 1976, the United States-Mexico Artifacts Treaty of 1970 was invoked by the Attorney General of Mexico. This resulted in the seizure of the codex and its return to Mexico. Sáenz donated the codex to the Mexican government and it is currently kept in a vault in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City and is not on public display. The claimed discovery of the Grolier Codex would make it the only pre-Columbian codex discovered in the course of the 20th century, except for some codex fragments excavated by archaeologists.|$|E

25|$|An English merchant, William Finch, {{who visited}} the tomb in 1611, {{describes}} the rich interior furnishing of the central chamber (in comparison to the sparse look today).

25|$|Unusually for {{a cruise}} ship of her time, the Homeric was built with a {{somewhat}} ocean liner-like layout, with her dining room in particular reflecting liner-like design, being located on a lower deck. She was also built with a sizeable promenade deck and a one-deck-high theatre. She was built with two swimming pools, one {{to the rear of}} the ship and another amidship which <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magrodome.|$|E
25|$|The Beothuk {{followed}} elaborate burial practices. After {{wrapping the}} bodies in birch bark, they buried {{the dead in}} isolated locations. In one form, a shallow grave <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rock pile. At other times they laid the body on a scaffold, or placed it in a burial box, with the knees folded. The survivors placed offerings at burial sites to accompany the dead, such as figurines, pendants, and replicas of tools.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Dyer {{crashed into}} Melbourne's Frank Hanna in round 15. The umpire cleared him for rough conduct, though Hanna was knocked unconscious.

By three-quarter time, he still believed he had killed him until he asked a Demon player about Hanna's condition, and Hanna had recovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} {{surrounded}} by ramparts from the early Roman Empire. This house would put in place between 15 BC and 15 AD. In 1869, excavations {{to the south of}} the old town revealed the existence of a monumental gate defended by two protruding towers. The façade, or at least the pillars which were observed during the excavation, <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large piece of sandstone and adorned with a frieze of military trophies: Shields, leggings and reastplates.|$|E
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.|$|E

25|$|The Roman theatre, {{which dates}} from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered by {{accident}} in 1951. The theatre is well preserved but has not been completely excavated. The Augustan character of the inscriptions found there date it from this period. The theatre {{appears to have been}} abandoned in the 3rd century, as it <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dump rich in small finds of the 3rd–4th centuries. The upper part of the stage was not covered, and its material was reused by the Arabs in the Alcazaba.|$|E
