In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not.

25|$|Opioids include opiates, {{an older}} term {{that refers to}} such drugs derived from opium, {{including}} morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. Opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. Narcotic, derived from words meaning 'numbness' or 'sleep', as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as narcotics. The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the case.|$|E

2500|$|The {{net tonnage}} {{calculation}} {{is based on}} a number of factors, one of which is the moulded draft d. [...] The choice of the value to use for d can be complicated. [...] For ships subject to the International Convention on Load Lines, the Summer Load Line draft is used, with the exception of cases <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a timber load line. [...] For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision load line assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. [...] Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a load line by its national government, the draft for that summer load line is used. [...] If the ship has no load line, instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. [...] Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the moulded depth amidships.|$|E
