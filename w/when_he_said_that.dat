5|$|Chopra {{said in an}} {{interview}} that Saif Ali Khan and Vidya Balan were not the first choices for the lead roles in Parineeta. In fact Abhishek Bachchan was being cast as Shekhar and Saif Ali Khan as Girish. However Abhishek walked out of the project and Saif readily was accepted as a replacement. This fact was corroborated by Saif in {{an interview}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him.|$|E
5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted to be a}} grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

25|$|January 1996: A {{listener}} from Penang {{called in}} {{during one of}} Patrick's show to relate his recent experience {{with a member of}} the police force. At a roadblock, a policeman had stopped him for allegedly drinking and driving, and asked for a bribe from the listener. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he did not have money with him, the policeman allegedly told him that he could call someone to bring him the money. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not have a}} phone, the policeman allegedly offered him the use of his mobile phone. After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews. The media went to town with this issue; famous local cartoonist Lat drew a satirical cartoon on the incident which was published in the New Straits Times.|$|E
25|$|The stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 {{minutes later}} than {{scheduled}} because the German rider, Hans Junkermann, had been ill {{most of the}} night. At first he wasn't going to start. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> after all he felt well enough, the organisers gave him the extra time to get ready. Junkermann was leader of the Wiel's-Groene Leeuw team and was allowed his privilege {{because he was in}} eighth position.|$|E
25|$|On July 23, 2007, Dahle became {{subject to}} media {{attention}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban and other Afghan rebels had the full right to fight Norwegian soldiers stationed in Afghanistan. The attention occurred only days {{later with the}} death of a Norwegian army officer in the Logar Province as a Norwegian military unit came under hostile fire. Dahle later replied to the criticism, saying that he did not support the death of Norwegian military personnel.|$|E

25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said {{that the government should}} be honest to the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E
25|$|Von Däniken {{put forward}} {{photographs}} of ancient stones in Peru, with carvings of men using telescopes, detailed world maps, and advanced medical operations, all beyond {{the knowledge of}} ancient Peruvians. But the PBS television series Nova determined that the stones were modern, and located the potter who made them. This potter makes stones daily and sells them to tourists. Von Däniken had visited the potter and examined the stones himself, but he didn't mention this in his book. He says that he didn't believe the potter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he had made the}} stones. Von Däniken says that he asked Doctor Cabrera, a local surgeon who owns the museum, and Cabrera had told him that the potter's claims were a lie and that the stones were ancient. But the potter had proof that Cabrera had thanked him for providing the stones for the museum. Von Däniken claimed that the stones at the museum were very different from those made by the potter, but the Nova reporters oversaw the manufacturing of one stone and confirmed that it was very similar to those in the museum.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{had high}} {{expectations}} from Parineeta's music {{because of the}} award-winning music that was provided in some of Chopra's previous films, such as ( [...] (1993) and Mission Kashmir (2000)). Shantanu Moitra, Parineeta's music director composed hundreds of tunes before six of them got finalised after a year's effort. After finalising the soundtrack, Chopra was appreciative of the musician's abilities <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Moitra {{has the potential to}} become another R. D.

500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} {{judiciary}} Denning firmly believed that the press {{should have access to}} the courts and freedom to criticise magistrates and judges.

I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy.

500|$|Otto Frank {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, [...] "It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In my case the role is reversed." [...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child.

500|$|Patrick van der Eem, working {{undercover}} for De Vries, had befriended Van der Sloot, who {{was unaware}} {{that he was}} being taped <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, Van der Sloot said that he summoned a friend named Daury. The two men neither phoned for medical help nor checked Natalee to determine if she might still be alive. [...] Then, according to Van der Sloot, Daury volunteered to load her on a boat, and he dumped Natalee's body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed [...] "insufficient" [...] to warrant Van der Sloot's, or anyone's, arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, Van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress Van der Eem, who he believed was a drug dealer.|$|E

Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things.

500|$|As September began, {{while on}} the {{campaign}} trail in Iowa, Biden confided to the Associated Press that he was [...] "counting on Iowa a lot". He hoped to come in [...] "first, second or an indistinguishable third" [...] and if not he would leave the campaign trail and return to Washington. His early statements seemed to mirror the future as he would ultimately drop out of the race after finishing lower than third in the Iowa Caucus. The results also presented a refutation of what he stated in September 2007 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the campaign was [...] "gaining some traction [...]" [...] The September 2007 assessments made by University of Iowa professor Bruce Gronbeck and Drake University professor Dennis Goldford displayed more merit {{at the end of the}} race after Gronbeck stated that Biden was not gaining traction in the race and with Goldford adding that [...] " [...] talks like a senator, not a president". Democratic strategist Ron Parker argued in September that Biden still had a chance but just had to sell his case to the American people.|$|E
500|$|The gig was {{scheduled}} on July 3, Sunday afternoon. The day before, performances by Ray Charles and singing group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross {{were met with}} crowd rushes. About 300 drunken hipsters made an uproar during Charles' performance caused by poor police security. The policemen attacked with teargas and water hoses. The riots became so out of control that the National Guard was called in at midnight to calm the crowd. [...] When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver James Cotton saw John Lee Hooker standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should get into his car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the United States Information Agency (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach American culture in other countries.|$|E
