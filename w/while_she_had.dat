She was {{defeated}} at the 2005 general election, following {{which it was}} widely reported that Clark was planning to defect to the Conservative Party, an announcement which was not popular locally. However, by early June it emerged that <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left the Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and did not intend to.|$|E
5|$|Rosemary Fenton {{was born}} on Lord Howe Island on 17 November 1936. Her father, Stanley Fenton, worked as a radio {{operator}} at the Civil Aviation Department on the island. Her schooling until matriculation was at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, a boarding school. She also did a course in nursing. When her mother died in 1952, she returned to Lord Howe Island to look after her father and two younger siblings, brother Stan and sister Robyn. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left the island to attend secondary school, she used to come home twice a year. Her paintings adorned the walls of her father's house.|$|E
5|$|In her April 2008 budget, Stelmach's Finance Minister Iris Evans {{forecast}} a $1.6billion surplus for 2008–2009. By August, she had revised {{this prediction}} to $8.5billion. The {{major reason for}} this change {{is an increase in}} oil prices: <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> estimated in April that they would average $78 per barrel over the fiscal year, by August increases—including a high of $147 per barrel in July—have led her to make a new estimate of a $119.25 per barrel average. By November, prices had fallen to $55 per barrel, and Evans estimated a $2billion surplus. By February 2009, the government of Alberta appeared poised to run a $1billion deficit. In April 2009, Evans released her budget for 2009–2010, in which she anticipated a $4.6billion deficit. This is the largest deficit in Alberta's history, and its first in sixteen years. The government's fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012–2013, when it again anticipates a surplus.|$|E

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only {{competed in}} ten races {{during her first}} World Cup winter, Neuner became a fixture in the German team in the 2006–07 season. She proved {{to be one of}} the fastest {{cross-country}} skiers in biathlon, and at 19 years old, regularly set the fastest course times. On 5 January 2007, Neuner won her first World Cup event, the sprint race in Oberhof, Germany. Her victory on home soil, before a crowd of 19,000 people, received considerable media attention and put her into the national spotlight for the first time. Two days later at the pursuit race, she forgot to reload her rifle after warm-up. She was handed a new magazine during the prone shooting and managed to finish third despite a total of six shooting errors.|$|E

He closed his studio in Carmel {{and moved to}} Santa Monica Canyon, California, where he opened a new studio with Brett. He implored Wilson to come and live with him, and in August 1935 she finally agreed. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an intense interest in his work, Wilson {{was the first woman}} Weston had lived with since Flora who had no interest in becoming a photographer. This allowed Weston to concentrate on her as his muse and model, and in turn Wilson devoted her time to promoting Weston's art as his assistant and quasi-agent.|$|E
25|$|With {{concern over}} the {{movement}} south from Shanghai to Canton, a traditional hotbed of unrest in China, of the Chinese revolutionary, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Asheville was sent south to Swatow. Sailing on 27 January 1923 for South China, Asheville reached Swatow on the 30th. Asheville remained at that port until 24 February before she shifted to Hong Kong for fuel, supplies, a dry docking and minor repairs; she stayed there for a month before she returned to Swatow on 27 March. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been at Hong Kong, Sun Yat-Sen had assumed the title of Generalissimo on 2 March and established his party firmly at Canton.|$|E

25|$|Her {{career began}} in 1909 when she replied {{to a local}} {{newspaper}} advertisement placed by producer/director Thomas Ince's Bison Motion Pictures. The movie studio was looking for someone with the physical attributes to portray an American Indian and who was physically capable of doing stunts and riding horses. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never acted before, Workman fit the appearance that Ince wanted. She apparently embellished her riding skills, as {{she did not have}} any, but nevertheless quickly learned horsemanship. Given the stage name Mona Darkfeather, she was cast in her first starring role as an Indian maiden named Owanee in the 1911 movie Owanee's Great Love.|$|E
25|$|A Queen of Thebes {{and wife}} of Amphion, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{fourteen}} children (Niobids), seven boys and seven girls, Leto {{had only one}} of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, {{at the sight of}} his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the {{scientists}} finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, {{she was unable to}} fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on cerebral lateralization and its effect on linguistic development.|$|E

25|$|Hall's {{first novel}} was The Unlit Lamp, {{the story of}} Joan Ogden, a young girl who dreams of setting up a flat in London with her friend Elizabeth (a {{so-called}} Boston marriage) and studying to become a doctor, but feels trapped by her manipulative mother's emotional dependence on her. Its length and grimness made it a difficult book to sell, so she deliberately chose a lighter theme for her next novel, a social comedy entitled The Forge. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> used her full name for her early poetry collections, she shortened it to M. Radclyffe Hall for The Forge. The book was a modest success, making the bestseller list of John O'London's Weekly. The Unlit Lamp, which followed it into print, {{was the first of}} her books to give the author's name simply as Radclyffe Hall.|$|E
25|$|After Cyber Sunday, the feud between King Booker and Batista {{continued}} with Batista unable to wrest the title from Booker. Eventually {{this led to}} a match at Survivor Series on November 26, where King Booker declared that if Batista failed to defeat him this time, it would be the last World Heavyweight Championship match he would receive. On the night of the show, SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long decided that if King Booker got counted out or disqualified, Batista would become champion. Late in the match, Queen Sharmell handed King Booker his title belt while referee Nick Patrick was not looking. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> Patrick distracted, the King attempted to hit Batista with the belt. Batista moved out of the way, knocked the belt out of Booker's hands and hit the champion in the head, allowing him to score the pinfall. After losing the World title, Booker feuded alongside former royal court member Finlay against Batista and John Cena, which led up to Armageddon where they lost.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, it was {{announced}} that Brown would miss The X Factor final due to illness.

25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. <b>While</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} two gods at the kalendae {{of every}} month is that of {{presiding}} over {{the birth of the}} new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number of days to the nonae, a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the curia Calabra and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the pontifex minor had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated, that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her labours: the role of Juno Covella is hence {{the same as that of}} Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of the woman with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery, <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to invoke Juno Lucina. At the nonae Caprotinae similarly Juno had the function of aiding and strengthening the moon as the nocturnal light, at the time when her force was supposed to be at its lowest, after the Summer solstice.|$|E
