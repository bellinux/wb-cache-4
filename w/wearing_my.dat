The girls are <b>wearing</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with [...] "DTF" [...] on the rear and shotguns in their hands.

As the song transitions from Alien's vocals to Spears's original version we are shown a montage of the girls and Alien robbing other spring breakers at gunpoint.

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm <b>wearing</b> <b>my</b> glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
