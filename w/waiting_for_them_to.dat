Items such as computer mice, car tyres, tobacco, house doors, plywood, plastic bags, and women's summer shorts {{were among the}} contents of containers wrecked around St Mary's. Most locals assisted in the clean-up operation, removing the items from the coastline. Quinnsworth bags, bound for Ireland, were used in shops for months following {{the wreck of the}} vessel. A couple of months later, St Mary's Quay had several containers moored alongside by local fisherman, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be sold back to the shipping companies or for scrap.|$|E

25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, eating lunch at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual working patterns. He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sit on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E

25|$|The Union reorganized after Kernstown: McDowell's command {{became the}} Department of the Rappahannock, Banks's corps became the Department of the Shenandoah, while western Virginia (modern West Virginia) became the Mountain Department, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont. All three commands, which reported directly to Washington, {{were ordered to}} remove Jackson's force {{as a threat to}} Washington. The Confederate authorities meanwhile detached Richard S. Ewell's division from Johnston's army and sent it to the Valley. Jackson, now reinforced to 17,000 men, decided to attack the Union forces individually rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> combine and overwhelm him, first concentrating on a column from the Mountain Department commanded by Robert Milroy. While marching on a devious route to mask his intentions, he was attacked by Milroy at the Battle of McDowell on May 8 but was able to repulse the Union army after severe fighting. Banks sent a division to reinforce Irvin McDowell's forces at Fredericksburg, leaving Banks only 8,000 troops, which he relocated to a strong position at Strasburg, Virginia.|$|E

The end of Quinn's pregnancy secret was also well received. Poniewozik wrote that the pregnancy storyline had felt as though [...] "the early Glee wasn't confident that people would be interested in it without these over-the-top soap opera twists."

Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that easy when the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before she smiled approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E

500|$|Emma's {{relationship}} with glee club coach Will Schuester {{is an integral}} part of her character. They have had an on and off relationship since the show's first season. Television critics have responded extremely well to the pairing between the two. Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly said of the episode [...] "Vitamin D": [...] "Matthew Morrison communicates so much with his eyes. There’s a softness and a longing in them that I’m always surprised Emma (Jayma Mays) matches." [...] Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship in the episode Sectionals. Natalie Abrams of TV Guide noted that she had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> kiss since the pilot episode, and Eric Goldman of IGN has deemed their coming together [...] "very hard to not feel good about". Dan Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude when Will finds Emma's empty office, and having him then question whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. Eric Goldman of IGN commented of the following episode: [...] " [...] I would have liked to at least see Shue and Emma as a couple for a few episodes, rather than such a quick split. It felt rushed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff added: [...] "I loved Emma's eruption to Will about how Sue Sylvester must have cheated and the kids deserved to win." [...] Robert Canning said of the Britney Spears oriented episode: [...] "The true focus of the episode was Will dealing with his lack of spontaneity. This stood as a contrast to the impulsiveness of Emma's new boyfriend, sexy dentist Carl played by the somehow always charming John Stamos. There's a fun love triangle building here which should only get better as Will becomes less of an insecure whiner." ...|$|E

[...] They appear to be cheating by peeking out from under their blindfolds, however.

2500|$|While {{screening}} the American {{invasion of}} Saipan, in June 1944 Spruance also defeated the Japanese fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Although {{he broke the}} back of the Japanese naval airforce by sinking three carriers, two oilers and destroying about 600 enemy airplanes (so many that, for Halsey in the Battle of Leyte Gulf a few months later, the remaining Japanese carriers were used solely as decoys {{due to the lack of}} aircraft and aircrews to fly them), Spruance has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in exploiting his success in the Philippine Sea. Buell quotes Spruance speaking with Morison: [...] "As a matter of tactics I think that going out after the Japanese and knocking their carriers out would have been much better and more satisfactory than <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attack us, but we were at the start of a very important and large amphibious operation and we could not afford to gamble and place it in jeopardy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first group}} of {{anti-tank}} dogs arrived at the frontline {{at the end of}} the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by [...] "special departments" [...] (military counterintelligence). Out of the {{first group of}} 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers. Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Soviet Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.|$|E
