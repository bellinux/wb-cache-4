Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that [...] "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be {{put off by the}} general weirdness of the show." [...] Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as [...] "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point," [...] and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that [...] "it's as if executives at the premium cable network <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen". James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes [...] "frustrating" [...] as well as [...] "spellbinding." [...] Amanda Murray of BBC said [...] "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to pass judgment on the show—it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great." ...|$|E
