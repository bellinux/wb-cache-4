5|$|Small {{numbers of}} AIF {{personnel}} also served in other theatres. Australian {{troops from the}} 1st Australian <b>Wireless</b> <b>Signal</b> Squadron provided communications for British forces during the Mesopotamian Campaign. They participated {{in a number of}} battles, including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army. A special force, known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Dunsterville, was formed from hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and one party under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. Australian nurses staffed four British hospitals in Salonika, and another 10 in India.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{broadband}} <b>wireless</b> communication, the <b>signal</b> processing {{may have}} these {{problems in the}} frequency aliasing and frequency offset. This paper presents an improved wavelet decomposition and reconstruction algorithm for the different properties of <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> in the interference. In order to achieve much better beamforming with low noise, this paper discusses the issue about beamforming and processing of broadband <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> based on wavelet packet decomposition. Simulation results show the effectiveness for the accuracy and calculation speed, and the results also prove that this method can have a strong anti-Doppler shift performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{optical fiber}} is well adapted to pass {{multiple}} <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> having different carrier frequencies by using radio-over-fiber (ROF) technique. However, multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> {{which have the}} same carrier frequency cannot propagate over a single optical fiber, such as wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) signals feeding multiple antennas in the fiber wireless (FiWi) system. A novel optical frequency upconversion (OFU) technique is proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, the novel OFU approach is used to transmit three <b>wireless</b> MIMO <b>signals</b> over a 20 [*]km standard single mode fiber (SMF). The OFU technique exploits one optical source to produce multiple wavelengths by delivering it to a LiNbO 3 external optical modulator. The <b>wireless</b> MIMO <b>signals</b> are then modulated by LiNbO 3 optical intensity modulators separately using the generated optical carriers from the OFU process. These modulators use the optical single-sideband with carrier (OSSB+C) modulation scheme to optimize the system performance against the fiber dispersion effect. Each <b>wireless</b> MIMO <b>signal</b> is with a 2. 4 [*]GHz or 5 [*]GHz carrier frequency, 1 [*]Gb/s data rate, and 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The crosstalk between the <b>wireless</b> MIMO <b>signals</b> is highly suppressed, since each <b>wireless</b> MIMO <b>signal</b> is carried on a specific optical wavelength...|$|R

25|$|During {{the night}} of 8–9 November, Emden sailed to Direction Island. At 06:00 on 9 November, the ship {{anchored}} in the Cocos lagoon, deployed a steam pinnace (to tow a 50-strong landing party in two boats, led by Emdens first officer, Hellmuth von Mücke, ashore), and transmitted the coded summons for Buresk. The ship was spotted by off-duty personnel at the cable and wireless station, and although the ship was initially suspected to be Minotaur, the station's medical officer observed that the foremost funnel was false, and informed superintendent Darcy Farrant {{that it may be}} Emden in the bay. Farrant ordered the telegraphist on duty (already alerted by the German's coded signal) to begin transmitting a distress call by wireless and cable. Emden was able to jam the <b>wireless</b> <b>signal</b> shortly after it began, while the cable distress call continued until an armed party burst into the transmission room. Minotaur heard the wireless call and acknowledged, but von Müller was unconcerned, as the signal strength indicated that Minotaur was at least 10 hours away. Von Mücke instructed Farrant to surrender the keys to the station's buildings and any weapons, which the superintendent handed over, along with news that the Kaiser had announced awards for Emdens actions at Penang.|$|E

2500|$|On 13 May 1897, Marconi, {{assisted}} by George Kemp, a Cardiff Post Office engineer, transmitted the first wireless signals over water to Lavernock (near Penarth in Wales) from Flat Holm.

His star rising, {{he was soon}} sending signals across The English channel (1899), from shore to ship (1899) and finally across the Atlantic (1901). A study of these demonstrations of radio, with scientists {{trying to work out}} how a phenomenon predicted to have a short range could transmit [...] "over the horizon", led to the discovery of a radio reflecting layer in the Earth's atmosphere in 1902, later called the ionosphere.|$|E

50|$|Macdonald {{worked on}} {{electric}} waves and solved difficult problems regarding diffraction of these waves by summing series of Bessel functions. He corrected his 1903 {{solution to the}} problem of a perfectly conducting sphere embedded in an infinite homogeneous dielectric in 1904 after a subtle error was pointed out by Poincaré. The major problem which he tackled was that of wireless waves. About the time that Macdonald published his prize winning essay on electric waves, Guglielmo Marconi was successful in the transmission of the first <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> across the Atlantic. However this posed a major problem at first because <b>wireless</b> <b>signals,</b> like light, should not be capable of being bent round the surface of the earth as apparently Marconi <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> were. Macdonald suggested that the wireless waves were being refracted by the atmosphere. It is now known that in fact the waves are reflected by the ionosphere.|$|R

30|$|The working {{principle}} is that {{power is supplied}} to the wireless receiving board and the outer magnetic ring on the cover by the cable and voltage-stabilizing circuit board. The rotating inner magnetic ring receives the voltage-stabilizing <b>signal</b> by <b>wireless</b> induction transmission, and all sensors in the detection roller and all the circuit boards on the rotating head are powered by the excitation power board. The output signals of sensor are gathered by the analog acquisition board, and the digital processing board implements analog-to-digital conversion. Digital processing and coding are performed under the conditions of magnetic coupling isolation and photoelectric isolation. The signals are then delivered to the wireless transmission board. The wireless transmission board converts the <b>signals</b> into high-frequency <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> and transmits the <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> to the <b>wireless</b> receiving board. The wireless receiving board converts the <b>wireless</b> <b>signals</b> to wired signals. Finally, the signals are transmitted to the remote signal-processing computer via the shielded cable.|$|R
