40|$|Abstract. Internet {{end-users}} increasingly face {{threats of}} compromise by visiting seemingly innocuous websites that are themselves compromised by malicious actors. These compromised machines are then incorporated into bot networks that perpetuate further {{attacks on the}} Internet. Google attempts to protect users of its search products from these hidden threats by publicly disclosing these infections in interstitial <b>warning</b> <b>pages</b> behind the results. This paper seeks to explore {{the effects of this}} policy on the economic ecosystem of webmasters, web hosts, and attackers by analyzing the experiences and data of the StopBadware project. The Stop-Badware project manages the appeals process whereby websites whose infections have been disclosed by Google get fixed and unquarantined. Our results show that, in the absense of disclosure and quarantine, certain classes of webmasters and hosting providers are not incentivized to secure their platforms and websites and that the malware industry is sophisticated and adapts to this reality. A delayed disclosure policy may be appropriate for traditional software products. However, in the web infection space, silence during this period leads to further infection since the attack is already in progress. We relate specific examples where disclosure has had beneficial effects and further support this conclusion by comparing infection rates in the U. S. where Google has high penetration to China where its market penetration rate is much lower. 1...|$|R

50|$|Many {{nations that}} allow {{at least some}} types of {{pornography}} attempt to ensure that those under their legal age for accessing porn (often 18 or 21) cannot easily access it. Various measures have been tried but with varying success. Within the United States, most websites have taken voluntary {{steps to ensure that}} visitors to their sites are not underage. Many Web sites provide a warning upon entry, warning minors and those not interested in viewing porn not to view the site, and requiring one to affirm that one is at least 18 and wishing to view pornographic content. Such <b>warning</b> <b>pages</b> have little effect in preventing access by minors to porn, as any minor interested in viewing the site can simply click on the “I am an adult over 18” button without having to prove his or her age. Thus, such warnings are generally not used by themselves but with other techniques. Commercial porn sites generally restrict access to any pornographic content until a membership has been purchased using a credit card. This serves as both a way to collect payment and an age verification method since credit cards are usually not issued to minors. So-called age verification services have also sprung up that offer access to any Web site that participates in their program without additional charge. The users need only verify their age with the verification service, which then issues a username and password that can access all sites that use its services. Most age verification sites charge either a monthly or yearly fee to those wanting access to participating sites.|$|R

40|$|Social Media (OSM) {{has become}} a massive e-crime. To counter the {{dissemination}} of long complex URLs in emails and character limit imposed on various OSM (like Twitter), the concept of URL shortening has gained a lot of traction. URL shorteners take as input a long URL and output a short URL with the same landing page (as in the long URL) in return. With their immense popularity over time, URL shorteners have become a prime target for the attackers giving them an advantage to conceal malicious content. Bitly, a leading service among all shortening services is being exploited heavily to carry out phishing attacks, work-from-home scams, pornographic content propagation, etc. This imposes additional performance pressure on Bitly and other URL shorteners {{to be able to}} detect and take a timely action against the illegitimate content. In this study, we analyzed a dataset of 763, 160 short URLs marked suspicious by Bitly in the month of October 2013. Our results reveal that Bitly is not using its claimed spam detection services very effectively. We also show how a suspicious Bitly account goes unnoticed despite of a prolonged recurrent illegitimate activity. Bitly displays a <b>warning</b> <b>page</b> on identification of suspicious links, but we observed this approach to be weak in controlling the overall propagation of spam. We also identified some short URL based features and coupled them with two domain specific features to classify a Bitly URL as malicious or benign and achieved an accuracy of 86. 41 %. The feature set identified can be generalized to other URL shortening services as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study to highlight the issues with the implementation of Bitly’s spam detection policies and proposing suitable countermeasures. 1 I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} communication {{methods used}} to inform the vulnerable community of Hilo, Hawaii of the impending tsunamis that struck in 1946 and 1960. These tsunamis caused tragic loss of life and enormous economic damage in Hilo and along {{the shores of the}} Hawaiian Island chain. Over 12 h notice of a possible large tsunami was given in 1960 and the siren warning system sounded more than 4 h prior to the event. The government agencies knew there was a tsunami alert and the media were broadcasting warnings. However, the 1960 tsunami took the lives of 61 people in Hilo only 14 years after 96 people were killed during the 1946 event. In order to discover why so many people perished, government agency logs recorded during the 1960 tsunami were examined and personal accounts from survivors of both the 1946 and 1960 tsunamis were analysed. Contributing to the tragic loss of life was a lack of communication between government agencies in addition to media inaccuracies and a public that was not educated in tsunami safety. Effective tsunami mitigation can only be accomplished through continual tsunami awareness education for the public, media and emergency personnel, and with accurate and timely tsunami <b>warnings.</b> 15 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{issues associated}} with the introduction into road vehicles of multiple information sources related to the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Also, an argument is made for an In-Vehicle Information System (IVIS) to manage messages from the associated Intelligent Transportation System Services, {{as well as other}} information to be presented to the driver. The IVIS serves as the interface between the driver and all the information sources, including both input from and information display to the driver. Increasingly, aftermarket systems, such as routing and navigation aids, collision avoidance <b>warning</b> systems, yellow <b>pages,</b> can be added to vehicles to aid in travel and/or the conduct of business in the vehicle. The installation of multiple devices, each with its own driver interface, increases the likelihood of driver distraction and thus the risk of an accident.

40|$|Background: Establishments {{dedicated}} to hookah tobacco smoking recently have proliferated and helped introduce hookah use to U. S. communities. Purpose: To conduct a comprehensive, qualitative assessment of websites promoting these establishments. Methods: In June 2009, a systematic search process was initiated {{to access the}} universe of websites representing major hookah tobacco smoking establishments. In 20092010, codebook development followed an iterative paradigm involving three researchers and resulted in a final codebook consisting of 36 codes within eight categories. After two independent coders had nearly perfect agreement (Cohen's κ = 0. 93) on double-coding the data in the first 20 % of sites, the coders divided the remaining sites and coded them independently. A thematic approach to the synthesis of findings and selection of exemplary quotations was used. Results: The search yielded a sample of 144 websites originating from states in all U. S. regions. Among the hookah establishments promoted on the websites, 79 % served food and 41 % served alcohol. Of the websites, none required age verification, < 1 % included a tobacco-related warning {{on the first page}}, and 4 % included a <b>warning</b> on any <b>page.</b> Although mention of the word tobacco was relatively uncommon (appearing on the first page of only 26 % sites and on any page of 58 % of sites), the promotion of flavorings, pleasure, relaxation, product quality, and cultural and social aspects of hookah smoking was common. Conclusions: Websites {{may play a role in}} enhancing or propagating misinformation related to hookah tobacco smoking.

40|$|Schmidt's work in 1938 was {{considered}} {{to be the first to}} recognize that anaesthesia may influence physiological and pharmacological responses [7]. Despite this early <b>warning,</b> Olmsted and <b>Page</b> [17] reported that, between 1962 and 1964, 90 - 94 % of cardiovascular studies were still using anaesthe-tized animals. Although the proportion of investi-gations performed today in anaesthetized animals is not established, anaesthetized, acutely-instru-mented animals are the model most often used. Frequently, concepts are proposed on the basis of data collected in these experimental conditions. Yet the limitations of such an approach are rarely considered. On the contrary, it may be claimed that basal anaesthesia does not interfere with cardiovascular function. Although there were earlier attempts to understand the consequences of general anaesthesia for cardiovascular function, for technical reasons most of the knowledge in this field has been collected only in the past 3 decades. For example, the instruments permitting the development of chronically-implanted animal models for the study of cardiovascular function were developed in the late 1960 s. As is often the case, a limited number of groups contributed most to current knowledge. The effects of anaesthesia on cardiac function have been discussed in a number of reviews. Although humans were the main focus [2, 11, 18], in a few cases other species have also been considered [19]. However, little consideration has been given to the potential effects of basal anaesthesia on cardiac function in animals. Vatner and Braunwald [23] provided an important review of the mechanisms by which general anaesthesia affects cardiovascular function. The consequences of basal anaesthesia have to be evaluated in terms of additive, synergistic and antagonistic effects...|$|R
40|$|Directed {{energy for}} {{planetary}} defense {{is now a}} viable option and is superior in many ways to other proposed technologies, being able to defend the Earth against all known threats. This paper presents basic ideas behind a directed energy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to impart a deflecting force on the target. A conceptual philosophy called DE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other papers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as a reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a directed energy array that heats {{the surface of the}} target to the point of high surface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an ejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the object. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses conventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the spacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation, the asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest spacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a system of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity tractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m diameter) asteroid with a 1 - to 15 -year targeting time (laser on time) depending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission parameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and size. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than current proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect all known threats with sufficient <b>warning.</b> Comment: 33 <b>pages,</b> 17 figures. Submitted to AS...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} infant {{car seat}} {{has been proposed}} to increase highway safety by reducing the incidence of crying, fussy behavior, and other child-related distractions that divert an adult driver s attention from driving. In addition to a conventional infant car seat with safety restraints, the proposed advanced infant car seat would include a number of components and subsystems that would function together as a comprehensive infant-care system that would keep its occupant safe, comfortable, and entertained, and would enable the driver to monitor the baby without having to either stop the car or turn around to face the infant during driving. The system would include a vibrator with bulb switch to operate; the switch would double as a squeeze toy that would make its own specific sound. A music subsystem would include loudspeakers built into the seat plus digital and analog circuitry that would utilize plug-in memory modules to synthesize music or {{a variety of other}} sounds. The music subsystem would include a built-in sound generator that could synthesize white noise or a human heartbeat to calm the baby to sleep. A second bulb switch could be used to control the music subsystem and would double as a squeeze toy that would make a distinct sound. An anti-noise sound-suppression system would isolate the baby from potentially disturbing ambient external noises. This subsystem would include small microphones, placed near the baby s ears, to detect ambient noise. The outputs of the microphone would be amplified and fed to the loudspeakers at appropriate amplitude and in a phase opposite that of the detected ambient noise, such that the net ambient sound arriving at the baby s ears would be almost completely cancelled. A video-camera subsystem would enable the driver to monitor the baby visually while continuing to face forward. One or more portable miniature video cameras could be embedded {{in the side of the}} infant car seat (see figure) or in a flip-down handle. The outputs of the video cameras would be transmitted by radio or infrared to a portable, miniature receiver/video monitor unit that would be attached to the dashboard of the car. The video-camera subsystem can also be used within transmission/reception range when the seat was removed from the car. The system would include a biotelemetric and tracking subsystem, which would include a Global Positioning System receiver for measuring its location. This subsystem would transmit the location of the infant car seat (even if the seat were not in a car) along with such biometric data as the baby s heart rate, perspiration rate, urinary status, temperature, and rate of breathing. Upon detecting any anomalies in the biometric data, this subsystem would send a <b>warning</b> to a <b>paging</b> device installed in the car or carried by the driver, so that the driver could pull the car off the road to attend to the baby. A motion detector in this subsystem would send a warning if the infant car seat were to be moved or otherwise disturbed unexpectedly while the infant was seated in it: this warning function, in combination with the position- tracking function, could help in finding a baby who had been kidnapped with the seat. Removable rechargeable batteries would enable uninterrupted functioning of all parts of the system while transporting the baby to and from the car.

This outstrips the combined orders won by Japan (5. 9 million CGT) and the whole of Europe (7. 4 million CGT). Korea is the world s largest shipbuilding nation and Korean shipbuilders are expected to lead the global market for the next decade. Korean firms have secured enough orders for future, especially increased orders for liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. There are almost 80 shipbuilders in Korea, but nine major shipbuilders, {{who are members of}} the Korea Shipbuilders Association (KSA), take most of the shipbuilding orders. Seven of them are among the world's top 10. The main players are Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction (HHIC). These giant monsters have threatened other shipbuilding nations, especially Europe. The EU has accused Korean shipbuilders of threatening the future of Europe s shipbuilding industry through unfair subsidies and took some actions against Korea as follows. In 1999, European Commission reported to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding, which showed European yards trapped in a crisis of downward spiraling prices, {{due in large part to}} excess capacities in South Korea. This report promoted the European Commission to issue a proposal for a Council Decision on the signing and conclusion of an International Agreement between the European Community and Korea relating to assistance of the world shipbuilding market. Eventually, the European Communities took Korea to the WTO in 2002, claiming that Korean shipbuilders received subsidies in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Moreover the EU has had Temporary Defensive Mechanism for Shipbuilding (the "TDM Regulation"), which is keeping Korean builders from selling vessels in the European market. Norwegian shipbuilding industry also has dramatically declined, being trapped in a crisis since 1998 under pressure by increased competition from Asia, but it survived by shifting production towards the national offshore oil and gas industry and ship equipment manufacturing. Norway becomes a leading manufacturer of ship s gear in the world. Korea is a major market for Norwegian suppliers of ship s gear and related service. Therefore, good prospects for Korean shipyards are good news for the Norwegian supply industry. Trade and investments between Norway and Korea has grown significantly over the past ten years in maritime industry and Korea is today one of Norway's major trade partners in Asia. Norway has one of the world s largest commercial shipping fleets, so Norwegian shipowners are one of major target for Korean shipbuilders. In fact, Norwegian shipowners have built many of their ships at the Korean shipyards. These ships have been big oil tankers, container ships, combination carriers and ro-ro ships. Korean builders eager to take more shipbuilding orders and have focused on building high-tech and high value added vessels e. g. liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, liquefied petroleum/chemical gas (LPG) carrier and passenger ships. Since the Norwegian petroleum sector is a main national industry and the crews business is well established and developed, a number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway are likely to rise steadily. Moreover, soaring demand for LNG, driven by rising gas consumption and higher crude oil prices, will boost the number of shipbuilding contracts between Korea and Norway. In short, shipbuilding marker as itself clearly shows the reason why we have to look closely at shipbuilding contracts between Norwegian buyers and Korean builders. My thesis will be a nautical chart for Norwegian buyers and Korean builders when they sail on unclear and risky water (shipbuilding contract) between Norway and Korea. My chart will not encompass all dangerous areas and <b>warnings,</b> because 50 <b>pages</b> are too short to display the Whole Ocean of shipbuilding contract. So I will limit myself to compare and analyze only the most significant clauses relating to Subcontracting in different standard forms under English law. The subcontracting is triple relationship among the buyer, the buyer and a subcontractor. Two parallel disputes concerning same defect thus may arise: i) one between the buyer and the builder and ii) one between the builder and a subcontractor. To avoid discrepancies in the course of judging disputes, they should endeavor to harmonies procedure provisions to avoid two parallel disputes at different fora and with different arbitrators or judges. If it is commercially and practically difficult to do so, the parties shall strive to incorporate reasonable and adequate clauses while considering the peculiar characteristic of subcontracting in the shipbuilding context after carefully analyzing those issues which I will discuses in this study. I will go deep into the issues to answer the following questions What is Subcontracting? in Chapter 3, To what extent is subcontracting permitted? in Chapter 4, To what extent is the builder responsible for the performance of the subcontractor? in Chapter 5 and To what extent is the builder protected in particular by the force majeure clause against delay or non-performance by the subcontractors? in Chapter 6. The answers to these questions can differ much, depending on the different terms and clauses in different shipbuilding contract. So I will attempt to answer the questions based on the Norwegian standard form, HHI, SHI, DSME, and HHIC standard form, comparing and analyzing the terms and clauses in those standard shipbuilding contract forms...|$|R
