5|$|Throughout history, {{humans have}} {{utilized}} fish {{as a food}} source. Historically and today, most fish protein has come by means of catching <b>wild</b> <b>fish.</b> However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China, is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein {{is estimated to be}} provided by fish. That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of <b>wild</b> <b>fish</b> in West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. <b>Wild</b> <b>fish</b> populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} current study was to determine selected haematological changes that occur in Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822). infected with trypanosomes. Blood films were prepared according to standard techniques to confirm trypanosome infections and whole blood was collected, the serum and plasma separated, and prepared for albumin and total protein concentration analysis. Plasma albumin levels were significantly higher in infected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish</b> than in uninfected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish</b> and uninfected breeding stock. Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in infected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish</b> when compared to uninfected breeding stock. The total plasma and serum protein levels were within the normal range for C. gariepinus, that is, 3 g – 6 g/ 100 mL. The total plasma protein levels varied significantly between the three groups. However, the total serum protein levels were only significantly different between uninfected breeding stock and uninfected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish,</b> as well as uninfected breeding stock and infected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish.</b> The total protein levels were significantly higher in infected <b>wild</b> caught <b>fish</b> than in the other groups, a possible indication of an infection or inflammatory host response...|$|R

25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other <b>wild</b> <b>fish</b> and other marine organisms. Salmon farming {{leads to a}} high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of <b>wild</b> <b>fish</b> are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} hatchery-reared fishes for {{restoring}} threatened and endangered populations {{is one of}} the most controversial issues in applied ecology. A central issue has been to determine whether releases cause extinction of local wild populations. This may arise either through domesticated or non-local <b>fishes</b> hybridizing with <b>wild</b> <b>fishes,</b> or through inappropriate behavioural interactions; for example, many hatchery fishes show exaggerated aggressive and competitive behaviour and out-compete wild counterparts. The impact of the impoverished hatchery environment in shaping behaviour is only now receiving attention. Attempts to counteract hatchery-related behavioural deficiencies have utilized intensive training programmes shortly before the fishes are released. However, we show here that simple exposure to variable spatial and foraging cues in the standard hatchery environment generates fishes with enhanced behavioural traits that are probably associated with improved survival in the wild. It appears that fishes need to experience a varying and changeable environment to learn and develop flexible behaviour. Using variable hatchery rearing environments to generate suitable phenotypes in combination with a knowledge of appropriate local genotypes, rehabilitation of <b>wild</b> <b>fishes</b> is likely to succeed, where to date it has largely failed...|$|R
25|$|Several {{scientific}} {{studies have suggested}} that caged farmed salmon harbour lice to a degree that can destroy surrounding wild salmon populations.

Further studies to establish wild–farmed fish interactions are on-going, particularly in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. A reference manual with protocol and guidelines for studying wild/cultured fish interactions with sea lice has been published.|$|E

25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer <b>wild</b> <b>fish</b> was too much to take on for the team, particularly this close to the capture date.|$|E

The helminth parasites of freshwater fishes of commercial fish farms, in Morelos State, Mexico were analysed. A total of 419 organisms of six freshwater fish species were collected in three fish farms and in small streams adjacent, in rainy and dry seasons. A total of 40 528 helminth were collected; the metacercarian of the flatworm Centrocestus formosanus affected largest number of host species. There were high levels of infection in all fish for this fluke, specifically for the Mexican molly, Poecilia sphenops it was also found in the native poeciliid fish the Asian tapeworm Botriocephalus acheilognathi, although with lower values in the parameters of infection.

25|$|The tangle net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually <b>wild)</b> <b>fish</b> unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E
