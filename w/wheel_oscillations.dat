The work {{was motivated by}} machining carbide coatings in gas turbine engine applications. The objective is to explore the process conditions and parameters satisfying the ground surface quality requirements. Surface grinding experiments were conducted with water based grinding fluid on chromium carbide coated on flat surfaces of aluminum blocks for rough grinding at a fixed wheel speed vs = 30 m/s, and finish grinding at vs = 30, 60 m/s. The effects of depth of cut and workspeed on grinding power, forces, and surface roughness were investigated {{for each of the}} wheel speeds. Material removal rate Q = 20 mm 3 /s for rough grinding at a grinding width b = 101. 6 mm was achieved. It was found that the maximum material removal rate achievable in rough grinding was restricted by chatters, which was mainly due to the large grinding width. The specific energy ranged from 27 to 59 J/mm 3 under the tested conditions. Surface roughness Ra = 3. 5 - 3. 8 5 m were obtained for rough grinding, while Ra = 0. 6 - 1. 5 5 m were achieved for finish grinding. Surface roughness was not sensitive to grinding parameters under the tested conditions, but was strongly dependent on the diamond grain sizes.

40|$|Hydraulic servo {{controls}} {{are designed to}} facilitate rotation in place without providing increased ppower to steering wheels. In the initial design phase, the dimensions required for control systems are usually obtained through the calculation of their load when wheels rotate in place, where the torque is calculated empirically. The starting point in the project calculation is thus to determine the hydraulic power steering torque torsional resistance which is then {{used to determine the}} maximum value of force i. e. the torque on the stering wheel. The calculation of the control system servo control consists of determining the basic parameters, the required pump capacity, the main dimensions of the hub and the  pipeline and the conditions for the stability of the system control mechanism. Introduction The aim of the calculation of the steering control system is to determine the basic parameters of its components which ensure the fulfilment of requirements of the control system. Calculations are performed in several stages with a simultaneous  detailed constructive analysis of the control system leading to the best variant. At each stage, design and control calculations of the hydraulic servo of the steering mechanism are performed. The design allows the computation to complete the selection of basic dimensions of the amplifer elements, starting from the approved scheme and the basic building loads of approximate values. Calculations control is carried out to clarify the structural solution and to obtain the output characteristics of the control amplifier which are applied in the  estimation of  potential properties of the structure. Project calculation Baseline data must be sufficiently reliable, ie. must correspond to the construction characteristics of the vehicle design and the control system as well as to service conditions [...] A proper deterimination of the torque calculation of torsional resistance in wheels is of utmost importance. Moment of resistance to wheel rotation in place The magnitude of the torque required to rotate drive wheels in place, is affected by: 1) load on wheels; 2) coefficient of friction of the tire surface; 3) dimensions and shape of the tire footprint on the surface, as deterimined by the pressure in the tire and its construction; 4) lateral stiffness of the tire; 5) turning radius of drive wheels; 6) angles of inclination of the pin; 7) moment of friction in pins and steering gear mechanism. To achieve the proper torque values of torsional resistance in drive wheels, it is necessary to take into account all these influential factors, as this provides a lower load on the elements in the control system while enabling easier control and reducing the moment of force on the steering wheel. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Mitin Mitin obtained the coefficient  only for one tire so the use of this formula is practically impossible. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Taborek Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place according to Lisov This formula takes into account the radius of the tire, but {{does not take into account}} the pressure and elastic characteristics of tires. Moment of resistance ito rotating drive wheels in place by Litvinov For the calculation by this formula, it is necessary to know the dependence of the tire footprint surface and the load on it. Moment of resistance to rotating drive wheels in place by Gough Experimental studies have shown that this term is very acceptable. Dimensions of the executive hydraulic cylinder The control amplifier must provide that the wheels rotate in place when the force of the driver on the steering wheel is not above 160 – 200 N in a complete range of the rotation angles from   for the inner wheel to for the outer wheel. Reactive and centering elements of the hydraulic servo control The control system without a hydraulic servo control must have one very important characteristic which is to develop the ability of the driver to feel the road configuration, especially when going around a curve. In order to achieve this, a reactive element is built into the hydraulic servo control, with a task to absorb rapidly drive <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillations</b> during the reverse inclusion of the hydraulic servo control (from the drive wheels to the steering wheel). Determination of the dimensions of reactive elements and the stiffness of centering springs Taking the results of the static analysis into account, the dependence of force and the torsional resistance in drive wheels can be obtained. From this dependence, P can be found  as a function of. Control calculation The control calculation is performed after selecting general elements of the control system and the amplifier. The control  calculation allows the reduction of amplifier dimensions through the transmission gear mechanism, by selecting the   part onto which amplifier force. is applied. Conclusion The calculation of the control system helps in determining the basic parameters of its elements and assemblies, thus providing the control over the vehicle motion. The main input data in calculating hydraulic servo control is the determination of torsional resistance in drive wheels. In order to achieve proper torque values in torsional resistance, it is necessary to take into account  the given influencing factors since this ensures, on the one hand, lower load on the control system elements and, on the other hand, easier control by reducing the force applied to the steering wheel. ECE Regulation № 79 defines the maximum force that can be applied to the steering wheel, so this paremeter of control systems must be taken into account in vehicle design. The piston stroke and the cylinder length are determined for maximum torque angles of drive wheels, followed vy the determination of the cylinder piston diameter. The tendency to reverse the action of the  hydraulic servo control would violate the basic requirement to the control system which is to get drive wheels back into straight line motion under the influence of the stabilizing moment. In order to prevent reverse action, a reactive and centering element is installed into the hydraulic servo control. Prestressing of central springs provides the return of the steering and drive wheels under the influence of the stabilizing moment without involving the hydraulic servo control. Friction force in the control mechanism must be lower than the force of prestressed central springs. The control computation is performed after the determination of all parameters in order to test the operating ability of the hydraulic servo control and to obtain its characteristics. A properly designed hydraulic servo control has to provide that the summary execution of torque hydraulic servo control and the driver exceeds the moment of resistance throughout the range of angles of rotation of wheels. </p...|$|E

This paper assesses a new system {{designed}} to produce some motor priming (consisting of directional steering wheel vibrations) when a car is at risk of lane departure.

Whilst on the one hand the motor priming mode was assumed to operate at the action level, on the other hand, other tested driving assistance devices were assumed to favour driving situation diagnosis.

Observed behaviours showed that all tested devices improved drivers' steering performance; however, performance improvements were greater with a motor priming system. No performance enhancement was recorded when steering wheel vibration or motor priming systems were combined with auditory warning.

50|$|NIRA Dynamics' {{core product}} is its Tire Pressure Indicator (TPI), an {{indirect}} tire-pressure monitoring system (TPMS) capable of detecting underinflation simultaneously {{in up to}} four tires. At the moment, TPI is installed in several Audi models (the A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q3, Q5, Q7, and TT); several Volkswagen models (Polo, Golf, Jetta, Beetle, Scirocco, Passat, Tiguan, Touran, and Sharan); several SEAT and Skoda models; {{as well as the}} Chery Arrizo 7 and the MG 3. It is also fitted to many Volvo, Fiat and Renault vehicles. The system meets the American FMVSS 138 and the European ECE R-64 regulations on tire pressure monitoring systems. TPI is a software component that uses both relative rolling radius information as well as <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillation</b> measurement. It estimates tire pressure mainly from the signals of the wheel speed sensors {{that are part of the}} anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic stability control system (ESC). It gets active shortly after a reset which triggers a self-learning process. A reset needs to be initiated by the driver when the tires have been changed or the pressure adjusted. TPI does not require any in-wheel pressure sensors and RF (radio frequency) components. The Audi TT series was the first to be equipped with TPI, in 2006. The Audi A4 and A5 models followed the next year. TPI can be fit into different electronic stability control hardware hosts, including those of Continental AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, and TRW Automotive.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn initial {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} which aimed to evaluate a particular function delegation mode on the test track. A car was equipped with an automatic device in order to replace the driver's lateral control of the trajectory (driving in the lane centre). The longitudinal control (speed) remained under manual control. The results showed difficulties in returning to manual control outside the domain of validity of the automatic device, with a suspicion of complacency. However, longer experience with the device would have been necessary to reach a higher level of trust and performance in the interaction between the driver and the device. In addition, negative interference between the bend-taking styles of the device and the driver were identified. A second {{experiment was}} carried out, again on the test track, in order to evaluate two types of mutual control modes. This took the form of criticising the driver when the car deviated more than 60 cm from the lane centre. With the warning mode, the driver heard a lateral noise {{on the side of the}} deviation and felt a non-specific steering <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillation.</b> With the action suggestion mode, the driver felt a steering wheel oscillation; this made the driver turn it toward the opposite side of the deviation. The two modes have revealed themselves to be sometimes efficient in critical situations where a trajectory deviation beyond 60 cm was provoked by a visual occlusion. Individual differences in effects were larger with the action suggestion mode than with the warning mode. No adverse cooperation effects were noticed...|$|R

40|$|As {{one of the}} brake-induced {{noises and}} vibrations, hot judder is forced vibration, which is caused by {{unevenness}} of the brake disc due to the thermal mechanical interactions in wheel brakes. Brake disc unevenness is normally described and evaluated as the Disc Thickness Variation (DTV) and the disc’ Lateral Run-Out (LRO). DTV and LRO gener-ate Brake Pressure Variation (BPV) and Brake Torque Variation (BTV) in wheel brakes, which are transmitted to the driver and perceived by the driver as the brake pedal pulsa-tion, the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillation,</b> the car body vibrations, and low-frequency drone noises inside a vehicle. Hot judder is characterized by hot spots on the disc surfaces. The frequency of hot judder {{is dependent on the}} wheel rotational speed, showing order behaviors. The num-ber of hot spots generally corresponds to the dominant order of hot judder. In the last decades, most of the hot judder tests have been carried out with brake dynamometers, and high numbers (typically around 10) of hot spots were found in the majority of the tests. The generation and development mechanisms of the high dominant order have been almost the exclusive focus of current hot judder researches. However, the influ-ences of the vibrations and noises (with higher frequencies compared with the low-order cold judder) caused by high-order hot judder on the driver’s subjective perception have been still not clarified. That is to say, it is still unknown in which form and under which conditions, the high-order hot judder can be transmitted to and perceived by the driver, and thus causing customer complaints. A top-down approach is used in order to investigate the influences of high-order judder on driver’s perception with respect to two aspects: the incidence of high-order hot jud-der in vehicle tests and the drivers’ perception of high-order hot judder. The first aspect is mainly investigated by studying the transferability of dynamometer tests to vehicle tests and by identifying the incidence of high-order hot judder in production brakes. Specifically, identical brakes from one front brake and one rear brake are separately tested with a brake dynamometer and through vehicle tests by means of road tests and chassis dynamometer tests, and all brakes of four production passengers are identified with accelerometers attached on the brake caliper and the caliper bracket. The perception of high-order hot judder is chiefly studied by investigating its transfer behaviors. Global transfer functions from BPV/BTV to the selected driver interface quantities (brake pedal pulsation, steering <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillation,</b> seat track vibrations, and vehicle interior drone noise) are defined, which establish the links between the hot judder intensity in the wheel brake and the intensity at the driver interface. In order to identify the transfer functions with a high signal-noise-ratio and better reproducibility, a novel testing method is adopted: vehicle tests with brake discs that are artificially modi-fied with the desired surface shapes simulating the high-order DTV/LRO. Altogether three vehicles with seven different modified discs are tested. Two critical levels of drone noise (60 and 80 dB(A)) are selected according to the general vehicle total noise level and the human’s perception characteristics of sound. The perception threshold values of the driver interface vibrations are obtained through regression analysis between their subjective ratings and objective measurements. Based on the critical drone noise levels and the threshold values of vibrations, as well as the global transfer functions, threshold values of BPV and BTV for perceiving the high-order judder are computed. Concerning the incidence of high-order judder, both the dominant order and the thermal increases of BTV and BPV for the dominant order showed great discrepancies in differ-ent test types (e. g. brake dynamometer or vehicle, drag braking application with con-stant velocity and constant pressure/torque or stop braking application with decreasing velocity and constant deceleration/pressure). Hot judder behaviors in the brake dyna-mometer test were not transferable to the vehicle tests. Besides, no evident high-order hot judder has been identified in all the brakes of the four passenger cars. Generally, hot judder seems to be more likely to be excited at the brake dynamometer than in the vehi-cles. Therefore, brake dynamometer test is still appropriate for detecting hot judder in the early phase of brake development, and thus preventing its occurrence in the vehicle. Regarding the driver’s perception, the drone noise is the most probable reason leading to customer complaints, since higher than 100 Hz less than 10 Nm BTV is required to perceive the drone noise and 50 Nm BTV can already result in unacceptable drone noise. The driver is less sensitive to the vibrations caused by high-order judder. Roughly at least 20 Nm BTV or 2. 5 bar BPV is needed for perceiving the vibrations, and the perception is most possibly due to the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>oscillation</b> or the vertical vehicle vibration. Moreover, some resonances in the transfer paths {{play a significant role in}} the high-order judder transmission. Although the investigations in this work are limited to three vehicles, the practical significance of high-order hot judder on the driver’s percep-tion is revealed for the first time. With these results, the impact of the measured BTV and BPV of hot judder, e. g. in the brake dynamometer tests, can be assessed. Combining these results, the most effective and efficient way to mitigate the high-order hot judder would be reducing its occurrences in the wheel brakes and diminishing the prominent resonances in the transfer paths...|$|R

Hitherto, ABS studies have been conducted mostly with straight-line motion. Relatively simple vehicle models have been used which cannot capture the interactions between non-linear handling dynamics and tyre behaviour. This article takes such interactions into account, using a non-linear 14 -degrees-of-freedom vehicle model in combination with three different single-point contact tyre models with transient characteristics. They include a stretched-string-based model, a modified stretched-string model, and a contact mass model. The particularly demanding situation of combined cornering/ABS braking is investigated. It is shown that although all tyre models are of similar bandwidth (maximum frequency ≈ 15 Hz), the simple string tyre model fails to cope with the non-linearities involved in combined braking/cornering and predicts greater braking distances than the two more enhanced tyre models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract i A {{vehicular}} driveline {{consists of}} engine, clutch, transmission, shafts, and wheels, which {{are controlled by}} a driveline management system. Experiments and modeling using a heavy truck show that there are significant torsional resonances in the driveline. A linear model with a drive shaft flexibility is able to sufficiently explain the measured engine speed and wheel speed. Engine control for automatic gear shifting is an approach {{at the leading edge}} of technology. A critical step is the controlling of the engine such that the transmission transfers zero torque, whereafter neutral gear can be engaged. Driveline oscillations is a limiting factor in this system. A model of the transmission torque is developed and a state-feedback controller is used to drive this torque to zero. The result is a possibility to optimize the time needed for a gear shift. Furthermore, neutral gear can successfully be engaged also when facing load disturbances and initial driveline oscillations. Traditionally in diesel trucks, the engine speed is controlled by a system called RQV. This system has the desired property of a load dependent stationary error, and the undesired property of vehicle shuffle following a change in pedal position. A model based state-feedback controller is derived that actively reduces <b>wheel</b> speed <b>oscillations.</b> The performance and driveability is significantly improved, while maintaining the desired load characteristics for RQV control. In conclusion, the proposed strategies improve performance and driveability in both speed control and gear-shift control. Acknowledgment ii...|$|R
40|$|The {{antilock}} {{braking system}} (ABS) is an active control system, which prevents the wheels from locking-up during severe braking. The ABS control cycle rapidly modulates braking pressure at each wheel mainly based on tire peripheral acceleration. Significant <b>wheel</b> speed <b>oscillations</b> and consequent fast variations of tire longitudinal slip are a consequence, which, in turn, produce a corresponding variation of tire longitudinal force according to the ABS control cycle. Clearly, tire characteristics, namely, tire peak friction (regulating maximum vehicle deceleration), longitudinal stiffness, optimal slip ratio, curvature factor (regulating {{the position of the}} peak of µ-slip curve and the subsequent drop), and relaxation length (accounting for tire dynamic response) may significantly influence ABS performance. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the effect of the main tire parameters on ABS performance. This task is, however, very challenging, since tire characteristics are intrinsically related, and the analysis involves interaction between tires, vehicle, and ABS control logic. A methodology based on the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) technique is used. This approach was selected to overcome limitations of numerical simulations or difficulties related to the execution of onroad experimental tests (repeatability, costs, etc.). The developed HiL test bench includes all the physical elements of the braking system of a vehicle (comprising the ABS control unit) and a 14 degrees of freedom (dofs) vehicle model, which are synchronized by a real-time board.

40|$|Stability {{investigation}} of car-trailer combinations (CTCs) based on time-frequency analysis (TFA) {{is the focus}} of this thesis. A state-of-the-art survey shows that very few research activities were performed to study the influence of the coupling between the vertical dynamics and horizontal dynamics, particularly for the system stability analysis. Based on the theoretical foundation of the stability analysis for CTCs, a time-frequency analysis based parameter identification method (TFA-based PIM) is proposed, in which a linear single-track model (STM), a Moving-Time-Windowed-Fast Fourier transform (MTWFFT) analysis method and an evaluation algorithm for the instantaneous cornering stiffness and the instantaneous effective axle load are integrated. It aims to study the time varying vehicle dynamics characteristics under harmonic conditions. With this PIM, vehicle dynamics parameters can be estimated continuously in time domain with a high accuracy in case a suitable model representing the system (here is a linear STM) is available. Also, they can be cross-checked by the phases of the obtained complex values of the general parameters involved here. For the analysis {{of the impact of the}} nonlinearity-induced harmonic dynamic axle load on the dynamic stability of CTCs, a complex driving dynamics simulation model of a CTC validated in the horizontal plane is utilized. With the PIM, the system characteristics of the simulation model are adjusted aiming for those delivered from the CTC applied in the road tests. To simulate the influence of the harmonic <b>wheel</b> load <b>oscillations,</b> a synthetic force generator is applied, which is synchronized to the phase of the yaw rate with a defined phase shift. Hence, the sensitivity analysis of the influence of the harmonic amplitude or phase of this force on the system dynamic stability is performed with a simulation model validated in the horizontal plane. Through this variation, the change of the system dynamic critical speed is actually determined and so is the reason why the temporal changes of the system dynamic stability can be explained by the fluctuations in the amplitude and/or the phase of the superimposed harmonic dynamic axle load...|$|R

The hydraulic modulator is controlled by an embedded computer, running the Linux operating system, onto which a slightly modified version of the Bosch ABS algorithm is coded in C-language. Brake tests are conducted with the vehicle on hard concrete terrains for both smooth roads and rough Belgian paving. The algorithm is also implemented in Matlab/Simulink using co-simulation with a validated non-linear full vehicle ADAMS model employing a validated FTire tyre model. The co-simulation model was validated with the test data on both flat and rough terrains and experimental results correlate well with simulation results when the recorded brake pressures from the test data are given as input to the simulation model. Test data and simulation results indicate that wheel speed fluctuations can cause inaccuracies in the estimation of vehicle velocity and excessive noise on the derived rotational acceleration values. This leads to inaccurate longitudinal slip calculation and poor control decisions respectively. Although possible solutions to the identified problem are not explored in detail, the developed simulation model and test vehicle can be used to test improved ABS algorithms and suspension control strategies to solve the deterioration of ABS performance on rough terrain.
