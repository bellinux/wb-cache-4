40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether thematic {{relations of the}} novel words could be acquired via descriptive episodes, and if yes, whether it could be generalized to thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> a different scenario. In Experiment 1, a lexical decision task was used where the novel words served as primes for target <b>words</b> <b>in</b> four conditions: (1) corresponding concepts of the novel words, (2) thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the same episodes as that in learning condition, (3) thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> different episodes, or (4) unrelated words served as targets. Event related potentials elicited by the targets revealed that compared to the unrelated words, the corresponding concepts and thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the same episodes elicited smaller N 400 s with a frontal-central distribution, whereas the thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> different episodes elicited an enhanced late positive component. Experiment 2 further showed a priming effect of the corresponding concepts on the thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the same episodes {{as well as in}} a different episode, indicating that the absence of a priming effect of the learned novel words on the thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> different episode could not be attributed to inappropriate selection of thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the two conditions. These results indicate that only the corresponding concepts and the thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> the learning episodes were successfully primed, whereas the thematic association between the novel words and the thematically related <b>words</b> <b>in</b> different scenarios could only be recognized in a late processing stage. Our findings suggest that thematic knowledge of novel words is organized via separate scenarios, which are represented in a clustered manner in the semantic network. </p...|$|R

40|$|The sable is an {{important}} animal for fur trade in the world since the ancient time in Eurasia. Therefore,it is important to review the names for the sables in various languages in Eurasia to investigate the transmission of words for the sables. In the present paper, to give basic information for the transmission and transformation of the words for the sable <b>in</b> Eurasia, <b>words</b> for the sable and 3 other species of marten (Martes sp.), weasels, and squirrels in Eurasian languages were investigated. In East Asia, the sable is called <b>in</b> various <b>words.</b> The sable was called "furuki" (or fuluki) in ancient Japan (ca. 8 to 13 c.). It is called “hoinu" -like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Ainu language,"dambi" with modifiers or other <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Korean, "bulgan"-like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Mongolic languages,and "segep" -like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Tungusic languages, and "diao" with modifiers in Chinese. In the regions of central-western Eurasia where the sable is (was) distributed,the sable is called <b>in</b> <b>words</b> of "bulgan"-like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Mongolic languages, those of "kish"-like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Turkic languages, "nukse"-like <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Finno-Ugric languages, and "sobol'" in Russian. In Iranian languages, the sable is fundamentally called <b>in</b> "samur". The <b>word</b> "samur" is spread in central-western Asia and southeastern Europe. In northern-western Europe,the sable is called <b>in</b> "sobol"-like <b>words.</b> <b>In</b> Eurasian languages, martens are sometimes called <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> related with squirrels.
