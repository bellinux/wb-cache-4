5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> My Gal (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and I Got You by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party).|$|E
