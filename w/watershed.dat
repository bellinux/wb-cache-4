Smaller <b>watersheds</b> such as Valaiyur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Periyakaruppu Odai and Solaimati {{are likely to have}} lower mean annual run off, lower mean discharge, higher sediment yield and higher flood discharge per unit area. Among the <b>watersheds</b> Koneri, Kottarakunu, Talugai and Belur <b>watersheds</b> are longer whereas Nakkasalem, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Sendarapatti and Valaiyur are shorter. The low drainage density in the <b>watersheds</b> of Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur reflects the lower rainfall intensity, rock resistivity, mean annual run off and higher vegetation cover. In contrast, the high drainage density in the <b>watersheds</b> of Shobanapuram, Sengattuppatti, Thalugai, Kallar, Periyakaruppu Odai and Kalungi reflects the higher rainfall intensity, rock resistivity, mean annual run off and lower vegetation cover. The analysis the estimated stream frequency values reveals that Maruvattur, Pulambadi, Silaiyur and Valaiyur are likely to have higher mean annual rainfall and lower degree of dissection and lower run off. On the other hand <b>watersheds</b> with high stream frequency values such as Kallar, Shobanapuram, Kalungi, Belur and Sengattuppatti are likely to have lower mean annual rainfall and higher degree of dissection and higher run off. Shorter length of overland flow in Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti, Talugai, Kallar, Periyakarruppu Odai and Kalungi <b>watersheds</b> implies that rain water will enter the stream relatively quickly, and lesser rainfall is sufficient to contribute a significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge, and the lag time will be shorter making them flash flood prone. In case of <b>watersheds</b> with longer length of overland flow such as Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur <b>watersheds</b> rain water will take relatively more time to enter into the stream, and hence only in case of higher rainfall there would be significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge. Longer lag time in these <b>watersheds</b> implies easier flood management. The {{analysis of}} infiltration number reveals that infiltration potential is higher in Pulambadi, Maruvattur, Silaiyur and Valaiyur <b>watersheds</b> on account of lower infiltration number values.
