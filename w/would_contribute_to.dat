5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{expelled}} George of Poděbrady's {{troops from}} Silesia. Matthias's army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, {{forcing him to}} withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection of an extraordinary tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{the costs of the}} war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.|$|E

5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the development of multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned Xenogears series.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the limited}} scope of Operation Summer '95, the Split Agreement became a {{fundamental}} instrument to change the overall strategic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where Bosnian Serbs had had the upper hand {{since the beginning of}} the Bosnian war, as well as in Croatia, where the front lines had been largely static since the 1992 Sarajevo armistice. As Operation Summer '95 concluded, the RSK and Republika Srpska changed their priority from smashing the Bihać pocket to fending off a possible Croatian offensive to capture Knin (advancing from the recently gained territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina). RSK leaders Milan Martić and Mile Mrkšić agreed with UN Special Representative Yasushi Akashi to withdraw from the Bihać area on 30 July, hoping the move <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> averting the Croatian attack. Albeit, the attack materialized days later as Operation Storm, a decisive victory to the HV in the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

He <b>would</b> then <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the three last tracks on Doe Maar’s second album Skunk. He <b>would</b> eventually <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the songs 32 Jaar, Smoorverliefd, and De Laatste Keer.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
