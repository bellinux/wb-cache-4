40|$|An {{estimated}} 60, 000 {{people die}} of rabies annually. The {{vast majority of}} cases of human rabies develop following a bite from an infected dog. Rabies can be controlled in both human and canine populations through widespread vaccination of dogs. Rabies is particularly problematic in Malawi, costing the country an estimated 13 million USD and 484 human deaths annually, with an increasing paediatric incidence in Blantyre City. Consequently, {{the aim of this}} study was to vaccinate a minimum of 75 % of all the dogs within Blantyre city during a one month period. Blantyre's 25 administrative wards were divided into 204 <b>working</b> <b>zones.</b> For initial planning, a mean human:dog ratio from the literature enabled estimation of dog population size and dog surveys were then performed in 29 <b>working</b> <b>zones</b> in order to assess dog distribution by land type. Vaccination was conducted at static point stations at weekends, at a total of 44 sites, with each operating for an average of 1. 3 days. On Monday to Wednesday, door-to-door vaccination sessions were undertaken in the areas surrounding the preceding static point stations. 23, 442 dogs were vaccinated at static point stations and 11, 774 dogs were vaccinated during door-to-door vaccinations. At the end of the 20 day vaccination programme, an assessment of vaccination coverage through door-to-door surveys found that of 10, 919 dogs observed, 8, 661 were vaccinated resulting in a vaccination coverage of 79. 3 % (95 %CI 78. 6 - 80. 1 %). The estimated human:dog ratio for Blantyre city was 18. 1 : 1.

40|$|The most {{important}} quality indicators of machining tool are accuracy and productivity. The {{most important}} factor affecting these two indicators is the stiffness of the supporting structure of machine. The processing in machining tools {{is based on the}} relative movement between the working billet and the cutting tool. The aim of the research is to improve the processing accuracy through equalizing the pressure in guides. The paper describes an optimizing method of the cutting area in machining tools, solving the tasks of the active <b>working</b> <b>zone,</b> and processing accuracy. The plot of pressure in guides is limited to straight or plane. There are three options: 1) diagram of uneven pressure distribution along the non-full length of guides; 2) diagram of uneven pressure distribution along the full length of guides; 3) diagram of even pressure distribution along the full length of guides. For optimizing the processing accuracy of a positioning system should be determined coordinates of the cutting zone, at which the pressure in guides must be as even as possible. The study was based on mathematical modeling and optimization of the cutting zone coordinates. We found the formula to determine the pressure in guides surface. Parameters to be optimized were selected force vectors and magnitudes of saddle in guides. The calculation technique was implemented in matlab 12 b. The analysis of calculating results shows that the function η of active <b>working</b> <b>zone</b> and the difference ∆р of maximum and minimum pressures are approximately linearly changed. The graphs show an impact of the different factors on the function η and the difference ∆р of pressure, and alleviate finding the most optimal solution. As a result of the study it has been found that: 1) the developed technique enables us to determine the active <b>working</b> <b>zone,</b> in which the pressure is distributed along the full length of guides; 2) the dependence of the processing accuracy on the parameters of the active <b>working</b> <b>zone</b> is defined; 3) there is the possibility to improve the processing accuracy through appropriately varying parameters of the positioning system. </p...|$|E
