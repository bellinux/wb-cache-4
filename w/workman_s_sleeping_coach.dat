50|$|Tver Carriage Works {{was founded}} on 25 August 1898 with the name Upper Volga Railway Materials Plant. It was built at the {{initiative}} of the Franco-Belgian joint stock company Dyle et Bacalan in 1898. Initially the plant manufactured four-axle <b>sleeping</b> <b>coaches</b> for the international train company Express, passenger coaches of 4 classes, business cars with study lounges and sleeping compartments, and passenger coaches for hot-climate countries. The plant produced freight cars, platforms and refrigerator vans of different systems, tank cars, and latticed cars for peat transportation. It fulfilled the orders for production of tram cars, components, and spare parts for tram cars. Tver Carriage Works also manufactured military transports, guns, spare parts for agricultural equipment, and vehicles. Beginning in 1904 the plant manufactured double-decker passenger coaches for migrants to the Far East, and produced six-axle diner-lounges with a length of 26 m for the Grand-Ducal family.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced on {{the night}} of 5 October 1936, it {{featured}} newly constructed <b>sleeping</b> <b>coaches</b> from the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits built to an adapted design to fit the British loading gauge, of the so-called type F (for Ferry). Twelve carriages (3788-3799) were built by ANF at Blanc-Misseron (near Valenciennes) in France in 1935-36, of which 1936-built Sleeping Car No. 3792 has now been preserved in the National Railway Museum in York. A further six were built in 1939 by the Compagnie Générale de Construction at St. Denis (3800-3805), but only entered service in 1946. A final seven (3983-3989) came in 1952, also built at St. Denis, to replace wartime losses. Thus, a total of 25 F-sleepers were built, all of the same design. In addition to sleeping cars, the train normally included two SNCF [...] "Fourgon" [...] baggage vans. Only one of those seems to be extant, and is currently stored in French rail sidings along with an unrestored F Class Sleeper Car (see also links to the irps-site below). Each overnight train carried up to five (very occasionally six) sleeping cars. When loaded onto the train ferry the train was split into sections and loaded equally on tracks on the port and starboard sides of the ship, to maintain its balance.|$|R

40|$|Purpose : To {{find the}} {{relationship}} between parents 2 ̆ 7 sleeping and living behaviors and their children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sleeping</b> habits, and to investigate factors specifically related to children staying up late in recent Japan. Methods : During regular health check-ups of children at three local health centers in the city A, we recruited the parents of one-and-half-year-old and three-year-old children {{to participate in the}} Child Sleep Cohort Project (ChiSCoP). Parents of 184 children who consented to participation were mailed three questionnaires by placement method. These are 2 ̆ 2 sleeping diary for 10 days, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 sleeping and lifetime rhythm survey, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 emotional behavior assessment scale (CBCL : Child Behavior Checklist 2 rd/ 3 rd edition), 2 ̆ 2 of which valid data on 178 children were collected over two years and analyzed. Analysis : Participants 2 ̆ 7 demographic data, perceived and actual sleeping and living habits, and bedtime patterns were compared among the groups classified by bedtime of children. Bedtimes were classified as early (before 21 : 00), normal (21 : 00 to 21 : 59), and late (after 22 : 00). Using one-way analysis of variance with two (early vs. late) and three bedtime categories, significant differences were found among the three bedtime categories about childcare environmental factors (meal, daytime activity, TV, nap, and bath). So we performed logistic regression analysis with 2 ̆ 2 late bedtime 2 ̆ 2 as the dependent variable and scores of environmental factors (upper or lower than median values) as independent variables in a stepwise manner to eliminate collinear variables and to obtain adjusted odds ratios. Results : 1) Among the 178 children, 96 and 82 were recruited during the physical check-up for one-and-half-year-old and three-years-old, respectively. There were 49, 72, and 57 children in the early, normal, and late bedtime groups, respectively, and no significant difference in attribute factors was found. 2) In children of the early bedtime group, proportions of those with 2 ̆ 2 efforts to establish good life rhythm 2 ̆ 2 (P < 0. 0001), 2 ̆ 2 efforts to cultivate sleeping habits 2 ̆ 2 (P < 0. 0001), and 2 ̆ 2 keeping a regular bedtime 2 ̆ 2 (P < 0. 05) were significantly higher, as well as for children who had more than 105 minutes of 2 ̆ 2 daytime nap 2 ̆ 2 compared to children who had less (P < 0. 05). 3) Children 2 ̆ 7 s bedtimes were significantly correlated with 2 ̆ 2 mother 2 ̆ 7 s wake-up time on weekdays 2 ̆ 2 (r = 0. 33) and 2 ̆ 2 mother 2 ̆ 7 s bedtime on weekdays 2 ̆ 2 (r = 0. 33). Children 2 ̆ 7 s wake-up times were also correlated with 2 ̆ 2 mother 2 ̆ 7 s wake-up time on weekdays and weekends 2 ̆ 2 (r = 0. 49) and 2 ̆ 2 mother 2 ̆ 7 s bedtime on weekdays 2 ̆ 2 (r = 0. 34), which indicates that children 2 ̆ 7 s wake-up times had relationship with mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sleeping</b> and life habits. 4) Later 2 ̆ 2 wake-up time on weekends 2 ̆ 2 (odds ratio = 4. 9) and 2 ̆ 2 regular bedtime hour 2 ̆ 2 (odds ratio = 3. 53) were found to be the determinant of late bedtimes of children. Conclusions : To encourage earlier bedtimes in children, it is important to take he mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sleeping</b> and living habits into account and to maintain a regular wake-up and bedtime schedule across weekdays and weekends...|$|R

Strain F 199 contained 2 -OH 14 : 0 and 18 : 1 � 7 c as the predominant cellular fatty acids and sphingolipids that are characteristic of the genus Sphingomonas. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16 S rRNA sequence indicated that F 199 was most closely related to Sphingomonas capsulata among the bacteria currently in the Ribosomal Database. Five additional isolates from deep Southeast Coastal Plain sediments were determined by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis to be closely related to F 199. These strains also contained characteristic sphingolipids. Four of these five strains could also grow on {{a broad range of}} aromatic compounds and could mineralize [14 C]toluene and [14 C]naphthalene. S. capsulata (ATCC 14666), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (ATCC 29837), and one of the subsurface isolates were unable to grow on any of the aromatic compounds or mineralize toluene or naphthalene. These results indicate that bacteria within the genus Sphingomonas are present in Southeast Coastal Plain subsurface sediments and that the capacity for degrading a broad range of substituted aromatic compounds appears to be common among Sphingomonas species from this environment...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of manned operations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the crew had performed hygiene activities within the aisle way (the habitable volume, not including the sleep areas) of the ISS. The Crew used wet towels, re-hydrated body soap, and "no-rinse" shampoo to cleanse themselves amongst the stowage and systems hardware, referred to as "racks", even without a designated area to dry the wet items. Performing hygiene in this manner became an accepted method; no isolated location was available to the Crew. After several years of hygiene operations, some of the fabric-covered racks began to grow biological material (generically described as mold) and soon became a Crew health concern. Hygiene {{has one of the}} strongest impacts on Crew morale, and mandating changes to the Crew routine would have been met with strong resistance. The answer to the conundrum was to develop a liner to be placed within the Temporary Sleep Station (TeSS), one of the Crew <b>s</b> <b>sleeping</b> racks.
