2500|$|Prior to the Spanish {{financial}} crisis from 2008, the monarchy traditionally enjoyed wide support and popularity by Spanish citizens since its constitutional restoration in 1978, according to Fernando Villespin, {{president of the}} Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS, English: Sociological Research Center) [...] in 2008. According to Villespin, the king's traditional approval rating of over 70% through the years consistently out-performed those of elected political leaders, with a similar percentage of respondents considering that the king {{played an important role}} in maintaining Spanish democracy. Public trust in Juan Carlos’ kingship [...] "comes only behind that of the National Ombudsman", Villespin continued. Members of the royal family were routinely voted among the most respected public figures in Spain, and in 2010 as many as 75% of Spanish citizens ranked the monarchy as [...] "above any other public institution in the country", according to Dr Juan Díez-Nicolás, a former president of the CIS and founder of the private consulting firm ASEP (Análisis Sociológicos Económicos y Políticos). The CIS, a non-partisan government funded independent research institution, has been researching public opinion of the monarchy since 1984 and tracks three basic lines of inquiry; what is public confidence in the monarchy, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the monarchy in a democratic system, and to what degree has the king contributed to the democratic process.|$|E
