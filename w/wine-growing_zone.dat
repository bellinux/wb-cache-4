As a result, the three-year (2010 - 2012) study found that the majority of indigenous varieties had small number of fruitbearing shoots in the bush: the varieties with colored berry - 53, 3 - 73, 3 %, in white-berry - 46, 6 - 75, 9 % except Shabash variety - 79. 9 %. We have identified the most productive varieties which were Dzhevat kara (62. 2 t / ha), Kokur Beliy (48. 9 t / ha), Kapselsky Beliy (44. 4 t / ha), and varieties with female type of flower: Kefesiya, Ekim kara, Kock pandas, Sary pandas and Crona gave not high yield: 22. 2; 22. 2; 24. 4; 28. 9 and 28. 9 t / ha. On the strength of growth, productivity and the accumulation of sugars in the juice of berries, we picked out varieties of Dzhevat kara, Crona, Kapselsky beliy. According to the main economic indicators, {{it turned out that the}} most profitable varieties are Dzhevat Kara, Kokur beliy and Kapselsky beliy.
