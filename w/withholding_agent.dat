50|$|Every <b>withholding</b> <b>agent</b> or intermediary, whether U.S. or foreign, who has control, receipt, custody, {{disposal}} or {{payment of}} any fixed or determinable, annual or periodic U.S. source income over foreign persons, must file these forms with the IRS.

40|$|The {{qualified}} intermediary program allows foreign financial institutions to assume certain tax responsibilities ordinarily borne by U.

Nevertheless, the program has recently come under attack due to perceived abuse by wealthy U. S. citizens who use the system to evade income taxes. In response, the Obama Administration proposes numerous changes to the program, intended to strengthen it. But these changes fail to appreciate the balance of values at stake in reforming the {{qualified intermediary}} system. This Note argues that until more benign changes are made, the unique jurisdictional dilemma created by the U.

40|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{enactment}} of the windfall profit tax, quarterly liability per barrel has significantly decreased. The average windfall profit tax dropped from $ 9. 94 per barrel in the se-cond quarter of 1981 to $ 8. 55 for the third quarter, a decrease of almost 14 percent. This excise tax is generally levied on the "windfall profit " generated by the phased decontrol of oil prices. The windfall profit tax base is the removal price per barrel (generally the price the oil is sold for) less the adjusted base price (a set base price adjusted by a quarterly inflation factor) and the State severance tax adjustment. The windfall profit, and therefore the windfall profit tax liability, fluctuates largely with changes in oil prices. These fluctuations have been espe-cially apparent since the full decontrol of oil in January 1981. For the second quarter of 1981, the removal price rose 11 percent over the last quarter of 1980, the adjusted base price remained about the same, and the tax rose 43 percent. In contrast, the removal price dropped by almost $ 2. 00 per barrel from the second to the third quarter of 1981, a result of the excess supply of crude oil. Since the adjusted base price increased at the same time, the result was a significant decrease in the profit and tax. The windfall profit tax liability is also affected by adjustments made by the <b>withholding</b> <b>agent.</b> These adjustments can result from under- or over-withhold-ing or the net income limitation. Should any of these occur, the depositing or <b>withholding</b> <b>agent</b> i...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this second}} part, the essay {{focuses on a}} real case about the {{functional}} decomposition of the application, already dealt in Part 1. The real case described here is about the system design process for the 2016 tax return certification compilation. The input elements of this functional decomposition process are the compilation instructions, the project constraints and the clusters of non-conformity. The proposed method enables to select, on each analysis level, the robust decomposition among the possible substantial decompositions, such as the configuration with the minimum data content. The measure of the system's data content was determined using the technique of function point. The aim is to provide software designers with a robust logical design of the system, in order to respect the fiscal deadlines, satisfying the user's requirements and guarantee a solution {{of the problems in}} the operating environment. The proposed application has a strong pro-active value, as it leads to the development of ad hoc solutions, avoiding the implementation of unnecessary data entry that does not provide any benefit neither for the taxpayer, nor to the <b>withholding</b> <b>agent.</b> This approach also allows having the necessary technical documentation at hand, to plan and monitor the implementation of the time of action, thus facilitating the system adaptation in the years to come...|$|E
40|$|The Act {{requires}} the State {{and local governments}} to use the Systematic Alien Verification of Entitlement (SAVE) program operated by the U. S. Department of Homeland Security to verify the lawful presence of anyone 18 or older who applies for taxpayer-funded benefits. The Act {{requires the}} State and local governments to use the SAVE basic pilot program to verify the legal immigration status of every person that is hired {{by the government in}} the State of Georgia. The Act also requires any employer paying an individual more than $ 600 per year, including contract workers, to verify the worker is eligible to work before they claim that payment as a business deduction on their state income tax. Local law enforcement officials are required the verify the nationality and legal status of anyone arrested and booked into jail for a felony. If the person arrested is an illegal immigrant, the Act requires the local agency to report that person to federal immigration officials. It requires contractors and subcontractors with the state to participate in the verification program used by the state government. The Act also makes human trafficking a felony. The Act provides that property used in conjunction with producing false identification to be contraband and makes such property subject to seizure and to forfeiture. The Act places restrictions on individuals performing immigration assistance functions, but exempts individuals licensed to practice law in the State of Georgia.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} few years, the Italian Welfare State has {{suffered}} {{from the effects of}} the serious economic crisis. The crisis has hastened the need to cut down the public expenditures. The current study focuses on the improvement of the effectiveness, the efficiency and the inexpensiveness of those processes related to the management of the tax services provided by medium/large <b>withholding</b> <b>agents.</b> The proposed method aims to improve handling Non-Conformities in a process, by introducing a project plan based on the Axiomatic Design methodology. This method aids in producing a set of robust planning solutions {{for a wide range of}} issues. Starting from the reported issues emailed to the Customer Support Service of the process, it is possible to catalogue the encountered issues through an Holistic Non Conformity Reduction approach, so that introduces such a level of abstraction necessary to define Non-Conformities of process in a basic and logical way. Then, we turn to the Axiomatic Design methodology in an iterative way and we find the set of planning solutions, which are more logically suitable to the operating context. In practice, this allows innovative and sustainable clustering approaches, making the development of proactive lessons learned possible. These can be used both in the development and in debugging of the information systems supporting the process management, ensuring an enhanced robustness against the frequent changes related to legislative measures and the forecasts adopted...|$|R

40|$|Many {{patients}} with malignant gliomas {{do not respond}} to alkylating agent chemotherapy. Alkylator resistance of glioma cells is mainly mediated by the DNA repair enzyme O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells compromises this DNA repair mechanism and increases chemosensitivity. MGMT promoter methylation is, therefore, a strong prognostic biomarker in paediatric and adult {{patients with}} glioblastoma treated with temozolomide. Notably, elderly patients (> 65 - 70 years) with glioblastoma whose tumours lack MGMT promoter methylation derive minimal benefit from such chemotherapy. Thus, MGMT promoter methylation status has become a frequently requested laboratory test in neuro-oncology. This Review presents current data on the prognostic and predictive relevance of MGMT testing, discusses clinical trials that have used MGMT status to select participants, evaluates known issues concerning the molecular testing procedure, and addresses the necessity for molecular-context-dependent interpretation of MGMT test results. Whether MGMT promoter methylation testing should be offered to all individuals with glioblastoma, or only to elderly patients and those in clinical trials, is also discussed. Justifications for <b>withholding</b> alkylating <b>agent</b> chemotherapy in patients with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastomas outside clinical trials, and the potential role for MGMT testing in other gliomas, are also discussed...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{the abdomen}} and pelvis house many organs and tissues of varying volume and density but {{the volume of}} adipose tissue was the strongest {{predictor}} of radiation dose. This finding is fortunate however as during the interpretation of CT images, intra-abdominal fat, when present in sufficient volume, can separate bowel loops from adjacent intra- and retroperitoneal structures effectively providing “internal” contrast that can help the interpreting radiologist to more accurately localise and identify pathology. As a consequence, numerous {{studies suggest that the}} decision to administer or <b>withhold</b> oral contrast <b>agents</b> should be based on the patient’s adiposity [24 – 26]. The authors raise the possibility that more aggressive dose reduction could also be employed on the basis of adipose tissue volumes that could be derived from previous CT scans or from single-slice analysis in those without previous CTs. Further research is required to evaluate the practical relevance of these parameters and to better define how it may help to optimise the CT technique and reduce the radiation dose.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new approach}} to testing hypotheses about the causes of discrimination in housing sales. We follow previous research by using data from fair housing audits, a matched-pair technique for comparing the traetment of equally qualified black and white home buyers. Our contribution is to shift the focus from differences in the treatment of teammates during an audit to agent decisions concerning an individual housing unit. Our sample consists of all units seen by either a black of a white auditor in the 1989 national Housing Discrimination Study. We estimate a multinomial logit model to explain a real estate agent's joint decisions concerning whether to show each unit to a white auditor and to a black auditor. We find evidence that real estate agents make and act upon inferences about a customer's preferences {{on the basis of the}} customer's initial inequity and that agents practice redlining, defined as the withholding of units in integrated neighborhoods. We find little evidence to support the conclusion that agents discriminate because of their own prejudice, but some evidence that they discriminate because of the prejudice of their white customes. More importantly, we find strong evidence of statistical discrimination; <b>agents</b> <b>withhold</b> houses from blacks when the probability of a successful transaction is perceived to be low. ...|$|R
40|$|Under Italian law the {{permanent}} establishment (“p. e. ”) {{plays a role}} in a number of taxes, although it is the income taxes and VAT the areas where such entity is mainly investigated by scholars and commentators. Its relevance and definition differ in the two areas of tax law. In particular under income tax law the entity, the notion of which, with a few exceptions, mirrors the OECD Anti-Double Taxation Model Convention’s, constitutes a criterion to locate the enterprise’s income, being still debated whether or not it may also have a certain relevance with respect to the nature itself and related classification of the Italian sourced income (as an enterprise’s income). Other functions of the p. e. which is worth mentioning relate to the admission to the so-called domestic consolidated tax regime, granted to EU controlling companies with a p. e. in Italy, and the <b>withholding</b> tax <b>agent’s</b> obligations which must be fulfilled also by foreign entities having a fixed base in Italy (and, accordingly, by any entity having a p. e. in Italy). Very sketchy is the Italian framework concerning the calculation of the income attributable to a p. e. and this holds true also when the domestic foreign tax credit regime related to the income of a foreign p. e. of an Italian resident enterprise comes into consideration. With regard to VAT, while the main role of the p. e., in compliance with both the Sixth and Re-Casting Directives, is to locate services’ supplies (so as to exclude the taxing power of the State of “prime” establishment), its relevance cannot be denied also in cases where supplies of goods are concerned. For instance for VAT purposes the presence of a p. e. in Italy – the notion of which in the VAT area is influenced by the ECJ case law - must be reported to the competent tax authorities regardless of the type of supplies which are provided through it. Despite the recent FCE Bank ECJ ruling, there are a few cases where a p. e. can be regarded as an autonomous VAT entity, separated from its head office, when dealing with same...|$|R
