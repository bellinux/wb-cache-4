5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E

5|$|Between August 1994 and August 1995, two {{companies}} of the regiment, initially A Company, 2/4 RAR and then B Company, 2 RAR, {{served with the}} Australian contingent of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR).

Vastly outnumbered and frustrated by a mandate that did not allow them to engage the perpetrators, the infantrymen were forced into a passive role during the massacre. Throughout the incident, however, they <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> fire attempting to assist wounded refugees. Meanwhile, 8/9 RAR was disbanded in 1997 after the discontinuation of the Ready Reserve scheme.|$|E
5|$|Confusion {{over the}} {{colouration}} of the Mascarene parrot {{has also been}} furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, {{and the strength of}} these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E
