5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E
