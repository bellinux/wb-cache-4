25|$|Some Canadian Members of Parliament saw the {{movement}} to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy.

Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998, which allows the ECHR to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerning}} the legend that cats could speak, {{it has been}} pointed out {{that it may have}} arisen because humans would misinterpret the cat's meowing as human language, and for this reason some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cat is not a type of yōkai. In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E

There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe.

500|$|Robert Heinlein {{was among}} the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s; along with Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke; they were known as the [...] "big three" [...] that {{dominated}} U.S. science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War era in his writing. Heinlein served in the U.S. navy for five years {{after graduating from the}} United States Naval Academy in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction. At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become Stranger in a Strange Land and wrote Starship Troopers. His motivation arose partially from his anger at U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's decision to suspend U.S. nuclear tests, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward. Writing in his 1980 volume Expanded Universe, Heinlein <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing by the United States sparked his desire to write Starship Troopers. Heinlein and his wife Virginia created the [...] "Patrick Henry League" [...] in an attempt to create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the physics}} literature, the {{spectral}} theorem is often stated {{by saying that}} a self-adjoint operator has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

In {{the case of the}} momentum operator , for example, physicists <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eigenvectors are the functions , which are clearly not in the Hilbert space [...] (Physicists <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eigenvectors are [...] "non-normalizable.")
