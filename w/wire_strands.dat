25|$|The cable {{construction}} technique {{differed significantly}} from that {{used for the}} earlier western spans and similar conventional suspension bridges. In that method, the cables were spun only a few wires at a time, with bundles made up as the wires were spun by pulling a loop along the cable's route. The SAS used a different technique, with the <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> pre-fabricated into mile-long cable bundles with bundle terminations already in place, pulled by dragging one end through the route. After attachment to the termination, a tensioning operation was performed on each bundle at the eastern anchor point, and the bundles were suspended a few feet above the catwalk. A total of 137 such bundles were installed. As bundles were positioned, they were temporarily tied together to form the cable. The cable was completely in place in late May 2012. It was later compacted into a circular shape, and then wrapped with a protective wire jacket. In mid-March 2013, the western portion was completed and the catwalks were removed. Wire wrapping was still in progress on the eastern portion.|$|E
2500|$|To {{align the}} teeth, circumdental wiring {{is often used}} where <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> (typically 24 gauge or 26 gauge) are wrapped around each tooth then {{attached}} to a stainless steel arch bar. [...] When the maxillary (top) and mandibular (bottom) teeth are aligned together, this brings the fracture segments into place.

2500|$|The signal or [...] "hinterland" [...] fence (Signalzaun) was {{the first}} of the border fences, {{dividing}} the Sperrzone from the more heavily guarded protective strip (Schutzstreifen) adjoining the actual border. Its purpose was to provide the guards with an early warning of an escape attempt. The fence itself was not a particularly formidable obstacle, standing only [...] high. At the top, middle and bottom, rows of electrified barbed <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> were attached to insulators. Cutting the wires or pulling them out of place resulted in an alarm being activated, alerting the guards to a possible breach of the fence. In practice, though, the border guards found that the fence frequently malfunctioned. The signal fence also had a [...] control strip on its eastern side. The fence was built on open high ground wherever possible, to ensure that intruders would be silhouetted against the sky and thus be more easily spotted. By mid-1989, [...] of signal fencing had been constructed along the border.|$|E

50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in the <b>wire.</b> <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid <b>wire,</b> but ordinary <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of the <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the circle packing problem for circles within a circle). A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> with the same cross-section of conductor as a solid wire is said to have the same equivalent gauge and is always a larger diameter.|$|R

2500|$|The {{table below shows}} various data {{including}} both {{the resistance of the}} various wire gauges and the allowable current (ampacity) based on a copper conductor with plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to solid <b>wires.</b> <b>Stranded</b> <b>wires</b> are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross sectional copper area. Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on 25°C ambient temperature. The table below assumes DC, or AC frequencies equal to or less than 60Hz, and does not take skin effect into account.

5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all <b>wire</b> <b>strands,</b> and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, stranded wires may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|E

50|$|Barbed wire cannot {{effectively}} contain pigs, goats or sheep. Where {{these animals}} are to be fenced, woven wire (called sheep or pig netting in Britain, sheep fence or hog fence in the United States) is used instead, often {{with one or more}} <b>strands</b> of barbed <b>wire</b> at the top.

50|$|<b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small wires bundled or wrapped together to form a larger conductor. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is more flexible than solid wire of the same total cross-sectional area. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> tends to be a better conductor than solid wire because the individual wires collectively comprise a greater surface area. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is used when higher resistance to metal fatigue is required. Such situations include connections between circuit boards in multi-printed-circuit-board devices, where the rigidity of solid wire would produce too much stress as a result of movement during assembly or servicing; A.C. line cords for appliances; musical instrument cables; computer mouse cables; welding electrode cables; control cables connecting moving machine parts; mining machine cables; trailing machine cables; and numerous others.|$|R
