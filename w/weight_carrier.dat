40|$|Conjugated {{bilirubin}} is excreted in the urine, but {{unconjugated bilirubin}} is generally believed {{not to be}} excreted by the kidneys. The basis for this difference has not been resolved by past stud-ies. Hoover and Blankenhorn reported that bili-rubin was dialyzable only from the plasma of pa-tients who had bilirubinuria, {{and that it was}} not dialyzable from the plasma of patients with acho-luric jaundice (3). Most subsequent investiga-tors, however, have maintained that neither con-jugated nor unconjugated bilirubin was dialyz-able or ultrafilterable from plasma (4 - 7). This led to the hypothesis that conjugated bilirubin was probably excreted in the urine by a process of renal tubular secretion (8). Studies that were performed in jaundiced dogs in this laboratory gave results consistent with a process of glomerular filtration of conjugated bilirubin (9). We therefore re-examined the question of the dialyzability of plasma bilirubin. A small fraction of plasma conjugated bilirubin in jaundiced humans and dogs was found to be dia-lyzable, and hence available for urinary excretion by glomerular filtration.

By contrast, neither the BIGF-I nor DIGF-II domain is sufficient to enable binding to type II IGF receptors, despite the fact that type II receptors, like the carrier protein, specifically bind IGF-I and IGF-II but do not interact with insulin. By differentiating those sites on the IGF molecule required for binding to IGF carrier protein and receptors, the insulin-IGF hybrid molecules should help delineate the role of the carrier protein in presenting biologically active IGF to target tissues...|$|E

Here we show, by simple mathematical modeling, how the relative abundance of large carrier proteins and their longer half-lives in the bloodstream work together to amplify the total blood concentration of these tiny biomarkers. The analysis further suggests that alterations in the production of biomarkers lead to gradual rather than immediate changes in biomarker levels in the blood circulation.

Both polymers were selected because of their intrinsic properties and their high solubility in organic solvents. The biodegradable polymer renders continuous and homogeneous microfibers under most of the electrospinning conditions tested, appearing to be an ideal carrier for the polythiophene derivative.

40|$|The central {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to develop}} a drug carrier capable of retaining the benefits of high molecular <b>weight</b> drug <b>carriers</b> but improving on the intratumoral spatial distribution of drug by engineering the carrier to disassemble in response to the tumor-specific endogenous signal of low pH. High molecular <b>weight</b> drug <b>carriers</b> improve clinical outcomes for cytotoxic chemotherapeutics by preventing their accumulation in healthy tissues, extending their circulation time, and allowing for gradual accumulation in solid tumors due to the leaky tumor vasculature. These carriers increase the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered, {{and as a result of}} these characteristics can exhibit improved antitumor effectiveness with reduced toxicity compared with free drug. One drawback of these formulations is that they exacerbate a problem inherent to tumor drug delivery, the poor penetration of drug into the tumor tissue due to the poor vascularization in many tumor regions coupled with the dense extracellular matrix, dense cell packing, and high interstitial fluid pressure of the tumor tissue. Therefore, a high molecular <b>weight</b> drug <b>carrier</b> that disassembles in response to a tumor-specific stimulus could retain the benefits detailed above but release the highly diffusive small molecule drug within the tumor site, improving its ability to penetrate into the tumor and treat the whole tumor volume. This work addresses this problem by synthesizing a pH-sensitive drug carrier capable of disassembling in response to the low extracellular pH that exists in many solid tumors. The drug carrier design is a polypeptide block copolymer with a histidine-rich hydrophobic block that self-assembles at pH 7. 4 but disassembles at slightly low pH as the histidine residues become charged and the hydrophobic block becomes increasingly hydrophilic. Chapter 1 briefly establishes key features of cancer and solid tumors that impact drug delivery, and then reviews the central findings of the field of tumor drug delivery. After an extensive discussion of pH-sensitive drug carriers that have been synthesized to date, an extended description of the proposed design is given. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterization of histidine-rich Elastin-Like Polypeptides (ELPs), the pH-responsive component of the material design. These polymers are synthesized using molecular biological methods and their transition temperatures are characterized using absorbance spectroscopy, demonstrating remarkable dependence on small pH changes in the physiological range of interest (pH 6 - 8). This chapter further demonstrates that histidine-rich ELPs are sensitive to transition metal ions known to coordinate with histidine, exhibiting a precipitous drop in transition temperature in the presence of µM concentrations of these ions. Chapter 3 characterizes histidine-rich ELP block copolymers (ELPBCs), demonstrating by dynamic light scattering that these polymers form micellar nanoparticles at body temperature and pH 7. 4 that disassemble at pH 6. 4. These micelles are stabilized by ZnCl 2 as demonstrated by a reduced critical micelle temperature observed by light scattering and critical micelle concentration shown by pyrene fluorescence. Static light scattering, Atomic Force Microscopy, and freeze-fracture Transmission Electron Microscopy confirm the presence of these particles and demonstrate that the ELPBCs form uniform spherical micelles. Chapter 4 attempts to develop these materials as drug delivery vehicles in several different schemes. First, drug encapsulation experiments are conducted to serve the initial design of pH-sensitive drug release, but these micelles have not yet demonstrated an ability to encapsulate chemotherapeutic drugs. An alternative scheme of disassembly-induced display of a ligand for cell entry is investigated by the inclusion of the LHRH peptide in the micelle core. Disassembly at low pH indeed increases cell uptake of the ELPBCs, but this effect does not depend on ligand presentation. Finally, based on the hypothesis that metal coordination resulted in the formation of crosslinks between ELP chains, histidine-rich ELPs are investigated as a depot formulation for intratumoral drug delivery. Chapter 5 returns to the original ELPBC micelle design and addresses the core questions of this work: does the histidine-rich ELPBC retain the benefits of high molecular <b>weight</b> drug <b>carriers,</b> and does low pH-induced disassembly enhance the intratumoral spatial distribution? A low pH mouse tumor model is established to test the effects of pH-sensitive materials, and then fluorescently and radioactively labeled pH-sensitive and pH-insensitive ELPBCs are injected to determine their pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and intratumoral spatial distribution. The histidine-rich ELPBCs exhibit extended blood circulation and tumor accumulation typical of high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>carriers,</b> although some healthy tissues take up significant amounts of both ELPBCs. The pH-sensitive histidine-rich ELPBCs demonstrate a more even distribution throughout the tumor volume than their pH-insensitive counterparts, indicating that stimulus-responsive nanoparticles can improve tumor penetration through a tumor-specific material response. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the main findings of the work as noted here, and discusses potential future directions. The main accomplishment of this work is the demonstration that histidine-rich ELPs exhibit triple stimulus-responsiveness and achieve an improved intratumoral spatial distribution. Dissertatio...|$|R

Here we have designed and validated a new methodology for looking at protease activity in live animals. In their simplest form, activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPP's) are hairpin shaped molecules that are comprised of a polycationic cell penetrating peptide, a neutralizing polyanion separated by a protease cleavable linker. In the presence of protease, the linker is cleaved and the released polycation can freely associate with cells. To detect these molecules in vivo, a payload such as a fluorophore or a T 1 imaging agent is attached to the polycation. We have found that MMP cleavable ACPP's give fluorescence contrast ratios of up to 3 -fold in tumors and atherosclerosis and thrombin cleavable agents give up to ten-fold contrast in stroke. Uptake is inhibited by commercially available MMP and thrombin inhibitors as well as by genetically knocking out MMP's. Attaching a large molecular <b>weight</b> <b>carrier</b> causes accumulation of fluorophores to increase further, and by attaching several gadolinium chelates to a single carrier it is possible to deliver micromolar amounts of gadolinium to tumors, allowing visualization by T 1 MRI without loss of protease dependence.

40|$|In a {{previous}} report (M. S. Wadhwa et[*]al. (1997) Bioconjugate Chem. 8, 81 – 88), we synthesized {{a panel of}} polylysine-containing peptides and determined that a minimal repeating lysine chain of 18 residues followed by a tryptophan and an alkylated cysteine residue (AlkCWK 18) resulted {{in the formation of}} optimal size (78 [*]nm diameter) plasmid DNA condensates that mediated efficient in vitro gene transfer. Shorter polylysine chains produced larger DNA condensates and mediated much lower gene expression while longer lysine chains were equivalent to AlkCWK 18. Surprisingly, AlkCWK 18 (molecular weight 2672) was a much better gene transfer agent than commercially available low molecular weight polylysine (molecular weight 1000 – 4000), despite its similar molecular weight. Possible explanations were that the cysteine or tryptophan residue in AlkCWK 18 contributed to the DNA binding and the formation of small condensates or that the homogeneity of AlkCWK 18 relative to low molecular weight polylysine facilitated optimal condensation. To test these hypotheses, the present study prepared AlkCYK 18 and K 20 and used these to form DNA condensates and conduct in vitro gene transfer. The results established that DNA condensates prepared with either AlkCYK 18 or K 20 possessed identical particle size and mediated in vitro gene transfer efficiencies that were indistinguishable from AlkCWK 18 DNA condensates, eliminating the possibility of contributions from cysteine or tryptophan. However, a detailed chromatographic and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of low molecular weight polylysine revealed it to possess a much lower than anticipated average chain length of dp 6. Thus, the short chain length of low molecular weight polylysine explains its inability to form small DNA condensates and mediate efficient gene transfer relative to AlkCWK 18 DNA condensates. These experiments further emphasize the need to develop homogenous low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>carrier</b> molecules for nonviral gene delivery...|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} was fully independent, with double wishbone and radius arm configuration, incorporating anti-squat characteristics. The car was fitted with Armstrong adjustable dampers and spring platform adjustment. Coil springs were used. A separate adjustable anti-roll bar {{was included in}} the suspension. Outboard drive-shafts were hollowed out to reduce unsprung <b>weight.</b> Rear hub <b>carriers</b> were made of magnesium cast. The suspension operates entirely on adjustable rod-ends with provision for toe-in and camber adjustments.|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{protein folding}} is {{mediated}} by a proteinaceous electron relay system, {{in which the}} concerted action of protein disulfide isomerase and Ero 1 delivers the electrons from thiol groups to the final acceptor. Oxygen {{appears to be the}} final oxidant in aerobic living organisms, although the existence of alternative electron acceptors, e. g. fumarate or nitrate, cannot be excluded. Whilst the protein components of the system are well-known, less attention has been turned to the role of low molecular <b>weight</b> electron <b>carriers</b> in the process. The function of ascorbate, tocopherol and vitamin K has been raised recently. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that these redox-active compounds can contribute to the functioning of oxidative folding. This review focuses on the participation of small molecular weight redox compounds in oxidative protein folding...|$|R
