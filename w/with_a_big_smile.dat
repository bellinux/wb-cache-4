500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Drowned World Tour of 2001, Madonna {{was asked}} whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and {{philosophy}} books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course." [...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this [...] is true. I never saw a groom walk down <b>an</b> aisle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>smile</b> than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip.

5000|$|In 1994, {{a puppet}} of Tony Blair made his appearance. He was {{originally}} {{a public school}} boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was [...] "IM THE LEADER" [...] in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced <b>with</b> <b>an</b> even <b>bigger</b> <b>smile</b> if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, John Prescott, was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> squeaky voiced Robin Cook, and an enormous glasses-wearing Jack Straw.|$|R

Me, I’m just a mechanic, just a bloody plumber.’ said Hives, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> board <b>smile</b> on his face. Rickover was thrown, he had not {{expected}} that kind of answer. When Hives explained that he had known Henry Royce himself, had worked for him, and had absorbed from him his passion for engineering excellence Rickover’s mood an attitude started to improve. Hives {{spent much of the}} lunch telling a captivated Rickover about Royce’s obsession with achieving perfection. He then took Rickover on a personal tour of the works, not in a Rolls-Royce or Bentley but in a very modest Hillman.…when Hives returned after showing Rickover around… the Admiral was a changed man, subdued, pleasant, cooperative, uncritical, and no further put-downs or denigrations of British engineering escaped his lips... That hour of dialogue… changed everything in the British nuclear submarine programme.|$|R

5000|$|Although not now readily {{available}} in the US, the brand remains strong in Latin America, and also manufactured in Hungary. In Brazil, for instance, Kolynos was the second best-selling brand, after Colgate itself. Because of antitrust concerns {{at the time of}} the acquisition, Colgate-Palmolive agreed to suspend marketing Kolynos-branded toothpaste in Brazil for a number of years. However, Colgate-Palmolive shortly began selling what was essentially the same product, with very similar packaging and marketing, under a new brand called Sorriso ("Smile" [...] in Portuguese), successfully transferring most of the customer loyalty to the new brand. Kolynos jingles have been written in several languages. In Peru, Kolynos is synonymous <b>with</b> toothpaste and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> can be called a Kolynos smile.|$|R
5000|$|Mabel Pines is an energetic, {{optimistic and}} bouncy girl from Piedmont, California, forced to spend her summer {{together}} with her great uncle Stan in the fictional town of Gravity Falls, Oregon. She is accompanied by her twin brother Dipper Pines. Their parents aren't revealed in the show. She makes the best of every situation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> goofy <b>smile</b> and her variety of colorful sweaters and skirts. She is a self-proclaimed arts and crafts master, {{going so far as}} to make a wax figure of her uncle Stan with the leftover wax of a melted figure during the episode [...] "Headhunters". She is actually growing to like Grunkle Stan and he likes her too, and is often protective. Mabel is boy-crazy and dislikes anyone who opposes her brother. She has a pet pig named Waddles who she won in the episode [...] "The Time Traveler's Pig". Despite seeming as just being there for comic relief, Mabel is frequently instrumental in helping her brother solve the mysteries of Gravity Falls and played a pivotal role in all three of the fights that the twins have had against the main antagonist, Bill Cipher, to the point that Dipper says that he has no chance of defeating Bill without Mabel's help.|$|R
5000|$|Madonna {{was still}} livid that Morton {{wrote the book}} without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for {{financial}} gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book was released. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] "Morton really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it - and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about - that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added. During the Drowned World Tour of 2001, Madonna was asked whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and philosophy books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course." [...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this in the biography is true. I never saw a groom walk down <b>an</b> aisle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>smile</b> than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old." [...] Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of his interest in the star, not least because she has made a [...] "difference" [...] to pop culture and modern culture. He added:"I'm very proud of the book and I'm very disappointed at Madonna's reaction. I think the problem is that she wants control over everything - that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open - Madonna's welcome to my house for a cup of tea.She said she wasn't interested in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which is a bit of a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Electronic marquee {{situated}} at {{the first floor of}} Soochow University law school is also an attractive feature. The interesting scrolling text often changes with time and combine current events with encouragements to students, for instance, [...] "The FIFA world cup is Brazil's, however, the final exam is yours". Therefore, it is usual to see students stop to watch the scrolling text <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on their faces.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for AllMusic, Jim Newsom commented the [...] "music on this {{recording}} is heavily electronicized [...]. {{but it sure}} {{sounds like a lot}} of fun."

5000|$|Zeppo's {{parts were}} always {{intended}} to be a parody of the juvenile role often found in sappy musicals of the 1920s-30s era. Sometimes, he would just have a few lines, and he would otherwise be reduced to standing in the background <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on his face. In these roles, he was a lampoon of the infamous extra, always grinning widely as a needless decoration, and always stiff and wooden. In other films, Zeppo would have a more significant role as the romantic lead, but he would still always be stiff, wooden, and, yes, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on his face. Either way, he could never be considered a real straight man. He was a sappy distortion of the real thing, and sort of the gateway through which we connected with the other Brothers. We perceived him as the [...] "normal, good-looking" [...] one of the bunch, but was he really? Wasn't there something about that line from The Cocoanuts, 'You can depend upon me, Mr. Hammer,' that was a little too ... happy? Roger Ebert called Zeppo 'superfluous,' and that is the point of his character in the five Paramount films. He was the straight man only in pure Marxian sense—while his Brothers spat on movie clichés, he imitated them, proving in his own way to be quite a brilliant comedian.|$|E

5000|$|Atomic Popcorn stated: [...] "Hip-hop and country. Like the Hannah Montana's {{theme song}} says, [...] "You {{get the best}} of both worlds." [...] Ten minutes before the movie started, the two rows of what looked to be 14-year-old girls started singing the TV show theme song. Over and over again. The little 6- to 10-year-old girls that filled the rest of the theater were singing along and dancing in their seats.

5000|$|Sometime in the nineties, when a fan {{arrived at}} Sapienza’s house early for a con-planning meeting {{and found her}} gardening, he pitched in to help, {{and one by one}} the other {{committee}} members did so too, as they arrived. Joe Mayhew warned people that if Baltimore won the 1998 Worldcon, all the committee members would wind up mowing Peggy Rae's lawn. Thus was born the phrase “I mowed Peggy Rae's Lawn,” which indicated that people were sucked in when Peggy Rae looked at them and said, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile</b> on her face, “You know, I think you would be good at…” ...|$|E
5000|$|Kiri no Hi caused less {{political}} uproar from Russia {{due to the}} movie's insistence as [...] "fiction" [...] and it did {{not focus}} on the Red Army's brutal actions but instead talked about world peace. At the end, the granddaughter of the survivor of the Soviet Invasion pointed at Sakhalin and said, [...] "Grandma, look, it's Sakhalin", <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>smile,</b> instead of calling the island its Japanese name of Karafuto, which hints that the Japanese people are willing to move on with the past and go forward even though they were the victim of the Red Army.|$|E

However, a new student starts to make himself known by beating up all the students. In a fight with the new student, Dai ends up on the ground, completely destroyed.
