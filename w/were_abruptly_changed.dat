40|$|Our {{experiments}} {{asked whether}} implicit learning occurs for novel nonverbal associations. We presented subjects with color names printed in incongruent colors; {{subjects were asked}} to name the color in which the word was printed. In Experiment 1, each of 7 color words were associated with the same incongruent color across 6 blocks of trials, and then the color-word associations <b>were</b> <b>abruptly</b> <b>changed.</b> Both control subjects and patients with amnesia reduced their color-naming times across the first 6 trial blocks, and naming times increased when the color-word associations were changed. In Experiment 2, similar results were obtained when neutral words were associated with colors. In Experiment 3, we found that naming times were not disrupted when an irrelevant dimension (typecase) was changed. Finally, in Experiment 4, we found that the effect persisted across a 5 -min delay. These studies provide evidence that implicit learning occurs for nonverbal associations and is independent of the brain structures damaged in amnesia. The nature of implicit memory has been a major focus of memory research in recent years (for recent reviews, see Schacter, Chiu, & Ochsner, 1993; Squire, Knowlton, & Musen, 1993).

Age Concern España was established by members of the British community to provide information and services on healthcare, benefits and local services in Spain. Four indicative case studies of those requesting assistance and classified as being of ‘serious need’ are presented.

The {{work was done}} {{as part of a}} study to relate predator abundances and distribution to juvenile salmonid mortalities associated with dams. Northern squawfish remained in protected shoreline areas in spring and early summer, when discharge rates were high, but moved close to the dam and the juvenile bypass outflow area in mid to late summer, when discharge rates were low. Trends in northern squawfish movements were similar during abrupt changes in discharge rate. During short-term closures of the spillway, when flow patterns <b>were</b> <b>abruptly</b> <b>changed,</b> four of five northern squawfish moved out of the protected areas and into the main river channel. Surface water velocities at 81 locations occupied by radio-tagged northern squawfish in June to August 1985 ranged from 0 to 70 cm/s (mean, 24. 5 cm/s). No preference within this range was evident, but the fish seemingly avoided areas of high current velocity, because they did not move into {{a substantial portion of the}} tailrace where water velocities exceeded 100 cm/s.

40|$|When three sheep <b>were</b> <b>abruptly</b> <b>changed</b> from a ration of 100 % orchardgrass hay to 60 % cracked corn- 40 % orchardgrass hay, fed at equal dry-matter intakes, {{significant}} increases in concentration were observed in the rumen microbial population. Bacterial numbers (colony counts) per gram of rumen contents {{did not appear to}} have stabilized within 21 days after the ration change; however, protozoan numbers per milliliter plateaued after 5 days. The concentration of cellulose-digesting bacteria varied considerably between animals and decreased in all animals with the change. Changes were observed in total and molar percentages of volatile fatty acids, which were typical for the two types of rations. Although the concentration of protozoa increased after the ration change, only minor differences were observed in their percent generic distribution. A significant decrease in rumen volume was measured in two of the three sheep with the change in ration; however, fluid turnover rates were not significantly affected. Rates of rumen dry-matter turnover were slower with the concentrate ration, although rumen dry-matter digestion was increased. Calculation of total bacterial numbers based on total rumen volume completely negated the effect of ration change in one animal, whereas total numbers in the other two animals were still significantly different between rations and very similar between animals. Adjustment of total protozoa numbers did not alter the trends seen previously with concentration values...|$|E

In the delocalized regime, we find that the relaxation dynamics of one-body observables, such as the density, the momentum distribution function, and the occupation of the natural orbitals, follow, to a good approximation, power laws. In that regime, we also show that the observables after relaxation can be described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble, while such a description fails for the momentum distribution and the natural orbital occupations in the presence of localization. At the critical point, the relaxation dynamics is found to be slower than in the delocalized phase. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, as publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{determine}} the limiting dynamics of a fermionic condensate following a sudden perturbation for various initial conditions. We demonstrate that possible initial {{states of the}} condensate fall into two classes. In the first case, the order parameter asymptotes to a constant value. The approach to a constant is oscillatory with an inverse square root decay. This happens, e. g., when the strength of pairing <b>is</b> <b>abruptly</b> <b>changed</b> while the system is in the paired ground state and more generally for any nonequilibrium state {{that is in the}} same class as the ground state. In the second case, the order parameter exhibits persistent oscillations with several frequencies. This is realized for nonequilibrium states that belong to the same class as excited stationary states. Our classification of initial states extends the concept of excitation spectrum to nonequilibrium regime and allows one to predict the evolution without solving equations of motion.

In GaAs co-doped with Si and B, the Ga injection causes a drastic decrease of the free electron concentration which is explained by an increased concentration of As-sublattice acceptors. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) results confirm this interpretation qualitatively as (SiAs) - and (BAs) -related modes dominate the spectra from the Ga-rich area of the sample. Pronounced PL peaks related to As-sublattice acceptors also appear in samples doped with B and Ge after Ga injection. The assignment of the PL modes was possible by taking account of the data in the literature and with respect to the results of Hall, Raman and mass spectrometric measurements.
