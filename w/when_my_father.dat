5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> remarried. Because for {{the three}} years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|She {{would bring}} home those 78 vinyl RPMs and <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was at work, she would play them. That was how I got exposed to jazz music... {{basically}} listening to Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, and Frank Sinatra. But {{also a lot}} of piano players, such as Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner, those were my mother's favorites.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E

60|$|And {{she must}} have talked, for there came a kind of feeling over everyone, as well as ourselves, that {{something}} was hanging over us, of which the issue would be known <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> illness took some turn.|$|R

2500|$|... “Just before {{returning}} to the West, father was invited into our Chapel to listen to the service. [...] He asked me what it was, and I told him it was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school. I was delighted at seeing my father so well treated and recognized. [...] Other chiefs had visited us, but my father was the first Indian to receive such courteous recognition and agreeable presents.|$|E
2500|$|Clapton's {{mother was}} a nurse who {{died when he was}} ten; his father was a doctor who died in 1999. Clapton has pterygiums and his eye surgeon {{recommended}} he wear dark glasses. Clapton met Susie, a fashion model, in the mid-1980s. They married and had twin daughters, Saskia and Montana. In March 2008 he appeared on ABC-TV's Talking Heads where he told Peter Thompson about his early life. He described the impact of his mother's erratic lifestyle prior to her suicide when he was ten; he then met his father {{for the first time and}} was enrolled in a private boarding school: [...] "My mother was sort of the antithesis of my father, because she had always aspired to... more the Bohemian artistic side of life" [...] and [...] "it was a bit of a shock <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> came to collect me... we just never got on. It was a fiery clash from the very start. My father obviously wanted me to become a doctor or some similar sort of career".|$|E
2500|$|Bowles {{could read}} at age 3 and was writing stories by age 4. Soon, he wrote surrealistic poetry and music. In 1922, at age 11, {{he bought his}} first book of poetry, Arthur Waley's A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems. At age 17, he had a poem, [...] "Spire Song", {{accepted}} for publication in Transition. This Paris-based literary journal served as a forum for leading proponents of modernism— Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, Paul Éluard, Gertrude Stein [...] and others. Bowles' interest in music also dated from his childhood, when his father bought a phonograph and classical records. (Bowles was interested in jazz, but such records were forbidden by his father.) His family bought a piano, and the young Bowles studied musical theory, singing, and piano. When he was 15, he attended a performance of Stravinsky's The Firebird at Carnegie Hall, which made a profound impression: [...] "Hearing The Firebird made me determined to continue improvising on the piano <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{was out of the}} house, and to notate my own music with an increasing degree of knowing that I had happened upon a new and exciting mode of expression." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod. [...] An he’s got the sharpest mind I’ve ever known; he’s so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was a mere}} {{child when}} it all happened, yet I {{remember}} it but too well, and I can recall how pleased I was <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> stepmother, Mrs. Montressor--she not liking to be called grandmother, seeing she was but turned of fifty and a handsome woman still--wrote to my mother that she must send little Beatrice up to Montressor Place for the Christmas holidays.

When he spent at the store the money he got from you, for one ounce he was given sixteen dollars’ worth of flour, not seventeen.

He was quite young, only a deacon; he lived in our house, and he was, with all his dear clumsiness, a {{daughter}} to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> a nurse to us.

I think those early cotton mill town days and the hard-working folk rushing to work I saw every day made a lasting impression upon me.
