Nevertheless, the fact the link needed to be bodily displaced in order to reverse meant that it required considerable vertical clearance. At {{the time of its}} introduction, it was deemed important in the locomotive world to keep the centre of gravity, and therefore the boiler centre line as low as possible. Because valve gears in Britain were generally placed between the frames beneath the boiler, the extremely cramped conditions made the valve gear inaccessible for servicing. Also reversing could be a strenuous occupation as it entailed lifting the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> plus eccentric rod ends.

50|$|In shift {{operations}} using {{mechanical link}} mechanisms in rear-engined buses, the FCT detected {{the position of}} the shift lever and converted it into an electronic signal. These signals were then used to perform transmission changes using air pressure. This resulted in easy shift changes and reduced driver fatigue, and also reduced the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> mechanism. A pseudo-reaction force was added to the operation to reduce driver discomfort. Moreover, elaborate fail-safe mechanisms were incorporated, such as one that prevented mis-shifts, and one that assured safe driving in the event of system failure. The FCT was used in MP series heavy duty route buses from November 1983 after basic research and multiple prototypes and practical tests over 10 years. It gained popularity in combination with measures to assist older drivers, and in the following year, it was applied to large heavy duty tour buses.|$|E

This amino acid network is a “small-world” network, and the network parameter is sensitive to the conformation change of protein. For some disease-related proteins, the highly central residues of the amino acid network are highly correlated with the hot spots.

Both degree-driven and weightdriven models are considered. Compared with the BA model and other evolving models with preferential attachment, there are two significant generalizations. First, besides the new vertex added in at every time step, old vertices can also attempt to build up new links, or to reconnect the existing links. The reconnection between both new-old and old-old nodes are recorded and the connecting times on every link is converted into the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link.</b> This provides a natural way {{for the evolution of}} edge weight. Second, besides degree and the weight of vertices, a path-related local information is also used as a reference in the preferential attachment. The path-related preferential attachment mechanism increases the clustering coefficient of the network. The model shows the scale-free phenomena in degree and weight distribution. It also gives well qualitatively consistent behavior with the empirical results...|$|E

However, who initiates the call might be important in other contexts than the passing of information, depending on the aim of the research, and Kovanen et al. have showed that reciprocal calls are often strongly imbalanced [17]. In the interacting pair, one user is often initiating most of the calls, so how can this be represented in an undirected network by a representative link weight? In a closely related question, most CDRs contain both information on voice calls and text messages, but so far {{it is not clear how}} to incorporate both pieces of information into one simple measure. Moreover, there seems to be a generational difference in the use of text messages or preference between texts and voice calls which may introduce a bias in measures that only take one type of communication into account [18].|$|E

40|$|Manipulation is an {{important}} issue for both developed and emerging stock markets. For the study of manipulation, it is critical to analyze investor behavior in the stock market. In this paper, an analysis of the full transaction records of over a hundred stocks in a one-year period is conducted. For each stock, a trading network is constructed to characterize the relations among its investors. In trading networks, nodes represent investors and a directed link connects a stock seller to a buyer with the total trade size as the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link,</b> and the node strength is the sum of all edge weights of a node. For all these trading networks, we find that the node degree and node strength both have tails following a power-law distribution. Compared with non-manipulated stocks, manipulated stocks have a high lower bound of the power-law tail, a high average degree of the trading network and a low correlation between the price return and the seller-buyer ratio. These findings may help us to detect manipulated stocks. ...|$|E

The crux of the model is the concept system (CS), which is an associative network of nodes connected by weighted edges.

In particular {{we are interested in}} the emergence and function of higher-level concepts and how they affect the agent’s behavior. The CS is accessed through a type of spreading activation, where stimulation spreads from one node to another based on several factors, such as the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between them. The CS contains both general and atomic nodes. Atomic nodes represent conceptions of idiosyncratic experience, and general nodes may represent anything else. The general nodes offer insight into how higher-level concepts could be stored in memory.

The out-strength of a node is equal to the total number of times that the diagnosis of that disease was followed by the diagnosis of any other disease. The out-degree of a node is the number of distinct diseases that follow that particular disease, without counting the multiplicities.

40|$|A novel {{group of}} small non-coding RNA, known as microRNA (miRNA) is {{predicted}} to regulate as high as 90 % of the coding genes in human. The diversity and abundance of miRNA targets offer an enormous level of combinatorial possibilities and suggest that miRNAs and their targets form a complex regulatory network. In the present study, we analyzed 711 miRNAs and their 34, 525 predicted targets in the miRBase database which generate a complex bipartite network having numerous numbers of genes forming the hub. Genes at the hub (total 9877) are significantly over represented in genes with specific molecular functions, biological processes and biological pathways as revealed from the analysis using PANTHER. We further construct a miRNA co-target network by linking every pair of miRNAs which co-target at least one gene. The <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link,</b> which is taken to be the number of co-targets of the pair of miRNAs vary widely, and we could erase several links while keeping the relevant features of the network intact. The largest connected sub-graph, thus obtained, contains 479 miRNAs. More than 75 % of the miRNAs deregulated in 15 different diseases collected from published data {{are found to be}} in this largest sub graph. We further analyze this sub-graph to obtain 70 small clusters containing total 330 miRNAs of 479. We identified the biological pathways where the co-targeted genes in the clusters are significantly over- represented in comparison to that obtained with that are not co-targeted by the miRNAs in the cluster. Using published data, we identified that specific clusters of miRNAs are associated with specific diseases by altering particular pathways. We propose that instead of single miRNA, clusters of miRNA that co-targets the genes are important for the regulation of miRNA in diseases.

40|$|Systematic {{reviews of}} {{scientific}} literature {{are important for}} mapping the existing state of research and highlighting further growth channels {{in a field of}} study, but systematic reviews are inherently tedious, time consuming, and manual in nature. In recent years, keyword co-occurrence networks (KCNs) are exploited for knowledge mapping. In a KCN, each keyword is represented as a node and each co-occurrence of a pair of words is represented as a link. The number of times that a pair of words co-occurs in multiple articles constitutes the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> connecting the pair. The network constructed in this manner represents cumulative knowledge of a domain and helps to uncover meaningful knowledge components and insights based on the patterns and strength of links between keywords that appear in the literature. In this work, we propose a KCN-based approach that can be implemented prior to undertaking a systematic review to guide and accelerate the review process. The novelty of this method lies in the new metrics used for statistical analysis of a KCN that differ from those typically used for KCN analysis. The approach is demonstrated through its application to nano-related Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) risk literature. The KCN approach identified the knowledge components, knowledge structure, and research trends that match with those discovered through a traditional systematic review of the nanoEHS field. Because KCN-based analyses can be conducted more quickly to explore a vast amount of literature, this method can provide a knowledge map and insights prior to undertaking a rigorous traditional systematic review. This two-step approach can significantly reduce the effort and time required for a traditional systematic literature review. The proposed KCN-based pre-systematic review method is universal. It can be applied to any scientific field of study to prepare a knowledge map...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} for deriving modules from protein-protein interaction networks, which combines functional information with topological properties of the network. This approach is based on weighted clustering coefficient, which uses weights representing the functional similarities between the proteins. These weights are calculated according to the semantic similarity between the proteins, {{which is based on}} their Gene Ontology terms. We recently proposed an algorithm for identification of functional modules, called SWEMODE (Semantic WEights for MODule Elucidation), that identifies dense sub-graphs containing functionally similar proteins. The rational underlying this approach is that each module can be reduced to a set of triangles (protein triplets connected to each other). Here, we propose considering semantic similarity weights of all triangle-forming edges between proteins. We also apply varying semantic similarity thresholds between neighbours of each node that are not neighbours to each other (and hereby do not form a triangle), to derive new potential triangles to include in module-defining procedure. The results show an improvement of pure topological approach, in terms of number of predicted modules that match known complexes. around a node, and it is defined, for any node i, as the fraction of neighbours of i that are connected to each other [3]. Simply stated, the clustering coefficient clust(i) reflects the presence of ‘triangles ’ which have a corner at i (see the triangle with dashed sides in Fig. 1). The clustering coefficient is also useful in measuring the global density of triangles in the network as a whole. In previous work, we have compared the clustering coefficient with its weighted counterpart, to characterize global properties of the network [4]. <b>Weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between a pair of proteins reflects the functional strength of the interaction, defined as semantic function similarity between those proteins.

40|$|The role {{of gender}} in {{language}} learning motivation {{has not been}} extensively researched, {{despite the fact that}} there seem to exist deeply rooted stereotypes suggesting that languages are considered a feminine domain (Norton & Pavlenko, 2004). The few studies from applied linguistics that examined gender reported that indeed female students are more motivated to learn English than their male peers (Bacon & Finneman, 1992; Bartram, 2006; Dörnyei & Csizér, 2002; Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Ryan, 2009). Sunderland (2004; in Carr & Pauwels, 2005) commented that lack in interest in language learning displayed by boys appears to be widely accepted as 'how it is' and few {{attempts have been made to}} critically analyse it (p. 21). Indeed, this appears to be the case in motivational research as the previously quoted studies offered little in the way of explanation of the reported gender differences. In this study, a mixed-methods approach has been employed in order to examine the role of gender in language learning motivation and proficiency. 599 Polish learners of English aged 15 - 16 completed a motivational questionnaire, which included scales of the ideal L 2 self, self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, instrumental orientation, international orientation, self-efficacy beliefs and English self-concept. Out of 599 participants filling in the motivational questionnaire, 398 completed the Quick Oxford Placement Test. Moreover, 20 students participated in semi-structured interviews. The quantitative data was analysed using factor analysis, MANOVA, t-tests, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and Wald tests, while the interviews were transcribed and coded. The results of MANOVA confirmed that there was a significant difference between males and females in terms of their overall motivation (Pillai’s trace =. 102, F = 7. 44, p <. 001) and the effect size was moderate (partial eta squared =. 102). Furthermore, three significant differences were detected on individual scales, namely ideal L 2 self, self-regulation and international orientation. In all cases, female participants scored higher than their male peers. The effect sizes were small. The result of the t-test showed that there was a small significant difference between the scores on the proficiency test according to gender, with female participants scoring higher than their male peers. The SEM models of language learning motivation fitted separately for male and female learners were also found to be significantly different (χ² = 592 on 191 df (p <. 001)). In particular, the Wald test revealed that the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>link</b> between L 2 self and intrinsic motivation was significantly stronger in the case of male than female students. The interviewees provided a number of potential reasons behind the higher motivation of female as compared to male learners.

Packets are sent along network paths from source to destination following a protocol. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is {{the most commonly used}} intra-domain Internet routing protocol (IRP). Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes with several outgoing links on a shortest path to the destination IP address. Link weights are assigned by the network operator. A path length is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> in <b>the</b> path. In this paper, I study <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> optimizing OSPF <b>weights,</b> given a set of projected demands, with <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> minimizing network congestion. The weight assignment problem is NPhard. I developed a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this problem...|$|R
30|$|Facebook {{feed and}} phone calls are used to create the {{communication}} networks: all interactions inside <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> 532 individuals are aggregated and static weighted networks are constructed. <b>Weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>links</b> are defined by <b>the</b> relative number <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>link</b> across <b>the</b> time period we consider. In the proximity network, weights represent the total time two individuals spent in <b>the</b> proximity <b>of</b> each other. However, in the activity analysis based on the call and Facebook networks, we did not consider link weight in these networks because unusual communication patterns within romantic couples (extremely high link weight) form a strong bias towards those links and their presence renders other contacts negligible. Therefore, each <b>link</b> in <b>the</b> digital communication networks is set to unit weight, and we consider <b>the</b> embeddedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students in these networks rather than their intensity of communication.|$|R
40|$|Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used intra-domain internet routing protocol. Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow evenly at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to <b>the</b> destination. <b>The</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>links,</b> and thereby <b>the</b> shortest path routes, can be changed by the network operator. The weights could be set proportional to their physical distances, but often the main goal is to avoid congestion, i. e. overloading <b>of</b> <b>links,</b> and <b>the</b> standard heuristic recommended by Cisco (a major router vendor) is to make <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> a <b>link</b> inversely proportional to its capacity. We study <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> optimizing OSPF <b>weights,</b> given a set of projected demands, in order to avoid congestion. We show this problem is NP-hard and propose a local search heuristic to solve it. We also provide worst-case results about <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> OSPF routing vs. an optimal multi-commodity flow routing. Our numerical experiments compare the re [...] ...|$|R
