Hua insisted that China {{could not help}} Vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles. Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E

From 1918 to 1919 she served as editor for the magazine, as well as contributing numerous articles. These were her most explicitly political writings, covering topics such as the contribution of Native Americans to World War I, land allotment, and corruption within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency within the Department of Interior that oversaw American Indians. Many of her political writings have since been criticized for favoring assimilation. She called for recognition of Native American culture and traditions, while also advocating US citizenship rights to bring Native Americans into mainstream America. She believed this <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could gain political power.|$|E

They sent demos to Ken Nelson, who was {{responsible}} for producing A Rush of Blood to the Head. Nelson soon responded, stating that he would be interested in working with them. With little financial security, they relocated to London and waited for Nelson to finish production on Coldplay's X. The start date of the recording of Howling Bells was repeatedly delayed because Coldplay was dissatisfied with its studio sessions. In the meantime, to support themselves, the members of Howling Bells took up temporary work. Eight to ten months after their arrival in England, Nelson contacted them with the news that he would soon be ready to record.|$|E
25|$|The two {{suspects}} at first denied {{any involvement in}} Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, Nödtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Göteborg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while Nödtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who {{at the sight of}} their clothes asked them if they were Satanist, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, Nödtveidt and Vlad tried to push back the unknown man, but he insisted. This <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> came to know Meddour.|$|E

Iverson added that it's [...] "pretty humorous in this episode <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> made fun of mediocre films." [...] In conclusion, Iverson gave the episode a final rating of 6.9/10.

500|$|The desired or correct {{sentence}} spacing {{is often}} debated but many sources now say additional space {{is not necessary}} or desirable. [...] From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers, {{and the majority of}} style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. [...] However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. [...] The debate continues. [...] Many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were taught to type.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics.

[...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on.

500|$|The {{first shot}} {{was a test}} of Pendant, a fission bomb boosted with solid lithium hydride {{intended}} as a primary for a thermonuclear bomb. Rather than being dropped from a bomber, this bomb was suspended from a string of four vertically stacked barrage balloons. This was chosen over an air drop because the bomb assembly could not be fitted into a dropable casing, but it introduced a host of problems. A balloon shot had been tried only once before by the British, during Operation Antler at Maralinga in October 1957. William Saxby from Aldermaston was placed {{in charge of the}} balloon crews, who commenced training at RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire in January 1958. Inflating the balloons required 1,200 cylinders of hydrogen gas, and there were no reserves. If another balloon test were required, then the empty cylinders would have to be returned to the United Kingdom for refilling, and then shipped out again. An important consideration <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could be shot down if they broke loose of their moorings with a live hydrogen bomb. The cargo ship SS Tidecrest arrived at Christmas Island on 20 July, but the firing harness was lost at San Francisco International Airport on 1 August, and a replacement had to be flown out. The Pendant fissile core arrived by air on 12 August, and the weapon was assembled with its external neutron initiator unit. On 22 August 1958 it was lifted [...] in the air, and it detonated at 09:00. The yield was assessed at [...]|$|E

This is how they reasoned. Your father's health, they said, was ruined, and if he lives the seven years what is there left for him when he comes out? He was a man, as you know, of aristocratic and fastidious tastes. He would have the best of everything--society, clubs, sport. Now all these were barred against him. If he had reappeared he could not have shown his face in Pall Mall, or on the racecourses, and every moment of his life would be full of humiliations and bitterness. Virtually then, for such a man as he was, life in England was over. Then there was you. You were a pretty child and the Earl had no children.
