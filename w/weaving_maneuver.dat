5000|$|Motorists {{wishing to}} perform a U-turn {{maneuver}} at a reverse jughandle must perform a <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver</b> across all cross-street lanes to travel from the jughandle terminus to the left-turn lane (unless another reverse jughandle {{is located on the}} other corner {{on the side of the}} cross street ahead of the motorist's original direction, in which case the motorist stays on the right but must cross through the intersection three times).|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver</b> {{is one of the most}} {{difficult}} maneuvers to analyze in terms of road safety. Weaving sections provide a transition for vehicles from the right lane to the left lane and from the left lane to the right lane; in order to allow drivers to enter a road stretch or to exit out of it. Interchange segments are the most likely area where road accidents occur because of the complexity of the <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver.</b> The complexity of this operation depends on drivers’ behavior and risk perception associated with the different phases that compose the maneuver: the intensity changing lanes, and braking and accelerating behaviors of a driver under different traffic flow conditions. Using an interactive driving simulator, this study proposes an analysis of drivers’ behavior on different weaving lanes in various traffic conditions. Three different lengths of weaving lane combined with four different traffic flow conditions were simulated and the different drivers’ performances have been analyzed. The objective of the research is to evaluate reliable indicators able to verify weaving maneuver's safety standards, in order to achieve more efficient design criteria. Several findings have shown that a driving simulator can ensure the reliability of measures and, it can also show the relationships between road geometrical characteristics and drivers’ behavior...|$|E
40|$|Weaving lanes are {{designed}} to ensure the crossing {{of two or more}} traffic streams traveling in the same general direction along a significant length of highway without the aid of traffic control devices. Weaving lanes are useful in many design situation: especially they assume a key role in roundabouts characterized by wide inscribed circle diameter, where the <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver</b> represents a crucial aspect for safety. This is confirmed by several findings, that demonstrate as the <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver</b> {{is one of the most}} difficult operation to analyze in terms of road safety. The need for research directed towards a functional analysis of roundabouts characterized by the weaving lane, comes from the necessity to ensure high safety standards through appropriate design procedures and safety audit. Particularly when European Community Countries were required to transpose the Directive 2008 / 96 /CE, which imposes a significant reduction in the road accident rate. Refering to Italian regulations, they only suggest to use probabilistic methods for designing weaving lane in roundabouts, leaving the designers free to choose the statistical distribution. Many studies report that the combination between the length of weaving lanes and the traffic volume is a key factor to explain high accident rate along interchange zones Bearing in mind this facet, the present paper proposes an analysis of driver behavior on different weaving lanes in various traffic conditions performed on an interactive driving simulator. Four different lengths of weaving lane combined with four different traffic flow conditions were simulated and the different drivers’ performance have been analyzed. The drivers were requested to drive along the four simulated road stretches, in four different runs, choosing the velocity, according to what the road scenario suggested them. A risk assessment has been conducted providing a methodology to define the weaving lane length by analyzing driver's behavior as a function of driver's risk perception. It has been observed that the increase of weaving lane length is effective only when the traffic flow conditions exceed a certain threshold. The results underline the reliability of driving simulator outputs, in particular regarding the investigation of the relationships between road geometrical characteristics and drivers’ behavior...|$|E

He designed New York City's famous Columbus Circle, which was built in 1905.

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of freeway weaving section {{has been a}} continuing challenge for the developers of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies. With {{the release of the}} 2010 HCM, a completely updated methodology is now available to practitioners. This new methodology represents a substantial departure from previous methodologies. In particular, the tabulation of <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuvers</b> is a critical driver, and the maximum length of a weaving section is now a dynamic value. With the release of the new methodology, transportation agencies and practitioners will be interested in specific assessments of its accuracy and logic. To address that need, this research will present a cross-cutting assessment of the methodology. The assessment was focused on two key attributes:• Sensitivity of parameters for determining weaving section length, and the differentiation between weaving and basic freeway segments. • A comparison of results from the 2000 and 2010 HCMs. The end result is guidance to agencies and practitioners implementing the 2010 HCM weaving procedures...|$|R
40|$|Service {{interchange}} ramp terminals provide access {{from the local}} highway or urban street system to the freeway. In urban areas, the ramp terminals at the arterial road are usually signalized for separation of all high-volume conflicting movements. If right-turn or other movements exiting from the ramp terminals are high, a free right-turn lane, which improves operations for right-turn and through exiting traffic, is sometimes provided at the ramp terminals with an exclusive lane for right-turn vehicles on a departure leg. If the ramp terminal is closely followed by the next downstream intersection, weaving maneuvers will occur since some vehicles make a right turn at the ramp terminal and make a left turn at the downstream intersection. These weaving vehicles usually slow down or stop on the free right-turn lane {{in order to find}} an acceptable gap in the arterial road traffic. These slowing or stopping vehicles may cause safety and operational problems. This research evaluates the effect of these weaving maneuvers on the operations of a free right-turn lane at the ramp terminals. To provide a means for evaluating free right-turn lane operations, a linear regression model was developed to predict the delay on the free right-turn lane caused by stopped or slowed vehicles planning on making a <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuver.</b> The variables for this model were arterial through volumes, weaving volumes, number of lanes, and ramp spacing within the interchange. The regression model was based upon the results of the CORSIM traffic simulation model that was calibrated using field data obtained from the study site in College Station, Texas. Once the predicted model was developed, the model validation was performed using the field data to check the accuracy of its prediction. A statistical measure was performed for quantifying the difference between the observed and predicted delay on the free right turn lane. From the research results, it was concluded that the weaving maneuvers influence the operation of a free right-turn lane and cause delay on the free right-turn lane...|$|E
40|$|This project {{developed}} a new HOV driver behavioral model that incorporates an access preference/choice model for examining travel time savings and a traffic model for calculating the acceptable gap to get in/out of buffer-separated HOV lane facilities. The model is incorporated into the Paramics simulator as a plug-in developed through API (Application Programming Interface) programming. In order to extend its capability for calibration and implementation, several user-specified parameters were incorporated during the model development process, including ingress and egress points selection control, and provision traffic information updates. The parameters of the model were tested and evaluated using both a sample, idealized, segment of freeway {{as well as a}} simulation network of the SR- 57 freeway in Orange County, California. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the reasonableness of the model; the freeway network was further investigated for model validation purposes. The results demonstrate the reasonableness of the proposed model under various traffic conditions. The proposed model also was demonstrated to better capture the <b>weaving</b> <b>maneuvers</b> observed on the SR- 57 freeway...|$|R
