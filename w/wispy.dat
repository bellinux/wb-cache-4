5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin <b>wispy</b> clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, <b>wispy</b> infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by <b>wispy</b> long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and <b>wispy</b> that solar heating {{of dust and}} ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, <b>wispy</b> golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E
25|$|He {{contracted}} diphtheria in 1878, which permanently damaged {{his voice}} and left it <b>wispy</b> and slightly impaired; two child siblings died from the disease during that year. The family later moved to Hudson. In 1878, he began school at Saint Mary's, but this was cut short in October 1882 when the family relocated again, to Burkhardt in Saint Croix County. In 1887, he left the farm {{for a series of}} jobs in his home state and in Minnesota, working as a lumberjack, a hospital orderly, a guard in the Minnesota state prison, and a street car operator in Superior. His time as a prison guard saw him befriend a couple of Jesse James' cohorts. At first, he desired married life, but the mother of a girl he had proposed to suddenly sent her off to a boarding school.|$|E
25|$|Scansoriopteryx fossils {{preserve}} {{impressions of}} <b>wispy,</b> down-like feathers around select {{parts of the}} body, forming V-shaped patterns similar to those seen in modern down feathers. The most prominent feather impressions trail from the left forearm and hand. The longer feathers in this region led Czerkas and Yuan to speculate that adult scansoriopterygids may have had reasonably well-developed wing feathers which could have aided in leaping or rudimentary gliding, though they ruled {{out the possibility that}} Scansoriopteryx could have achieved powered flight. Like other maniraptorans, Scansoriopteryx had a semilunate (half-moon shaped) bone in the wrist that allowed for bird-like folding motion in the hand. Even if powered flight was not possible, this motion could have aided maneuverability in leaping from branch to branch. Scales were preserved near the base of the tail, and the Epidendrosaurus specimen also preserved faint feather impressions {{at the end of the}} tail, similar to the pattern found in Microraptor.|$|E

500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens with a pretty, <b>wispy</b> vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before she waves her arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into a frenzied ecclesiastic hymn is utterly spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|E

As described by Ira A. Robbins, author of The Trouser Press Guide to '90 Rocks, Ivy was attempting to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. Doing so, the lyrics–particularly any adjectives used–were summarized as [...] "lifting, <b>wispy,</b> and shimmering" [...] by Jay Stowe, a columnist for Spin. Chase and Schlesinger solely produced the EP, while the two plus Durand handled the lyrical aspects. The record's only single, [...] "I Hate December", was released on January 12, 1996 as a remix on a CD single. However, the release was fronted by Scratchie Records instead of Seed, as the band had departed from the latter label after completing Realistic. A music video for it was produced by Doug Werby and released sometime in 1995. Schlesinger described the inspiration behind the track as being an [...] "anti-Christian single" [...] and called the remixed version [...] "groovy".

500|$|Benjamin Champney was {{a master}} at {{painting}} water and is known for warm autumn colors. William F. Paskell (18661951), in his later style, used broad brushstrokes and bright colors to create an impressionistic feeling.

500|$|Rhea is {{the second-largest}} of Saturn's moons. In 2005 Cassini {{detected}} a depletion of electrons in the plasma wake of Rhea, which forms when the co-rotating plasma of Saturn's magnetosphere is {{absorbed by the}} moon. The depletion was hypothesized {{to be caused by}} the presence of dust-sized particles concentrated in a few faint equatorial rings. Such a ring system would make Rhea the only moon in the Solar System known to have rings. However, subsequent targeted observations of the putative ring plane from several angles by Cassinis narrow-angle camera turned up no evidence of the expected ring material, leaving the origin of the plasma observations unresolved. Otherwise Rhea has rather a typical heavily cratered surface, with the exceptions of a few large Dione-type fractures (<b>wispy</b> terrain) on the trailing hemisphere and a very faint [...] "line" [...] of material at the equator that may have been deposited by material deorbiting from present or former rings. Rhea also has two very large impact basins on its anti-Saturnian hemisphere, which are about 400 and 500km across. The first, Tirawa, is roughly comparable to the Odysseus basin on Tethys. There is also a 48km-diameter impact crater called Inktomi at 112°W that is prominent because of an extended system of bright rays, which {{may be one of the}} youngest craters on the inner moons of Saturn. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered on the surface of Rhea.|$|E

A review carried by Post wrote that Ranaut had [...] "little scope" [...] in a role that did not suit her. India Today described her next film, the Madhur Bhandarkar-directed drama Fashion (2008), as a [...] "landmark" [...] in her career. Set {{against the backdrop of}} the Indian fashion industry, the film co-starred Priyanka Chopra and Mugdha Godse and featured Ranaut as Shonali Gujral, a substance abusing supermodel struggling to cope with her foundering career. Because the media speculated that her role was based on the former model Geetanjali Nagpal (which both Ranaut and Bhandarkar denied), the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), ordered a stay on the film's release, approving it only after a script narration. With a worldwide revenue of 600 million Indian rupees (...) , approximately US$10 million, Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha as one of the best films of the decade with women protagonists. Ranaut's performance drew unanimous critical acclaim. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised her confident portrayal of the character and believed that she was the real star of the film, and Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India added that she [...] "does an exquisite metamorphosis from a <b>wispy,</b> high-strung, nervous child-woman to a stunning ramp diva."
