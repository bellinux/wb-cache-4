25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a <b>wire</b> <b>whisk</b> until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

50|$|Ball whisks have no loops whatsoever. Instead, a {{group of}} {{individual}} wires {{comes out of the}} handle, each tipped with a metal ball. The heavy balls are capable of reaching into the corners of a straight-sided pan. Since there are no crossing <b>wires,</b> the ball <b>whisk</b> is easier to clean than traditional looped varieties. Manufacturers of ball whisks also purport that their shape allows for better aeration.|$|R
50|$|Stand mixers {{mount the}} motor driving the rotary {{action in a}} frame or stand which bears {{the weight of the}} device. Stand mixers are larger and have more {{powerful}} motors than their hand-held counterparts. They generally have a special bowl that is locked in place while the mixer is operating. A typical home stand mixer will include a <b>wire</b> <b>whisk</b> for whipping creams and egg whites; a flat beater for mixing batters; and a dough hook for kneading.|$|E
50|$|Due to its undissolved {{granulated}} sugar, and its {{rough and}} gritty texture, the table chocolate {{is not meant}} to be eaten like a chocolate bar, although Mayordomo bars can be eaten out of hand. The bars and discs are primarily used to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form. Chocolate Mayordomo is prepared on the stove by dissolving the squares in hot milk or water, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or <b>wire</b> <b>whisk.</b> In Mexico, in the traditional Aztec and Mayan form, chile peppers are added to make both sweet and savory dishes.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{chocolate}} bars, {{and because}} of its undissolved granulated sugar, and its rough and gritty texture, table chocolate {{is not meant to}} be eaten like a chocolate bar, although Ibarra tablets can be eaten. However, Ibarra is used primarily to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form. The labeling on Ibarra's packaging suggests {{that the best way to}} prepare Ibarra is to use approximately two wedges for each cup of milk or water. Heat the milk until it is near boiling, then blend the milk and chocolate in a blender until the chocolate is completely dissolved, and serve hot. Ibarra can also be prepared on the stove by dissolving the wedges in hot milk, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or <b>wire</b> <b>whisk.</b> In Mexico, in the traditional Aztec and Mayan form, Cayenne pepper is added to make it a spicy chocolate drink.|$|E

50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a <b>wire</b> <b>whisk</b> to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityWhile {{the sponge}} cake (SC) baking test {{involves}} a lengthy, complicated procedure and requires experienced personnel to properly conduct the test, {{it provides the}} most informative and reliable estimation of overall end-use quality of soft white and club wheat especially for their uses in many Asian countries. Understanding of soft white wheat quality traits affecting SC baking is lacking and in great need of improvement. The objectives of this research were to develop a simple, fast and reliable baking test for predicting flour quality for use on sponge cakes and to identify functional properties of soft white wheat flour important for making acceptable sponge cakes. A simpler and comparably reliable SC baking test procedure was developed by making considerable modifications to the conventional test procedure at the egg foam whipping and batter mixing stages. Foam density, SC volume and crumb grain {{comparable to that of}} the conventional procedure were obtained with modifications, including extension of whipping time without heat input using a 5 -liter KitchenAid® mixer, one time water addition at 3 min before the completion of egg whipping instead of twice, and flour incorporation into the egg foam using a KitchenAid® <b>wire</b> <b>whisk</b> or a Beater Blade®. The modified method of using Beater Blade® or <b>wire</b> <b>whisk</b> for batter mixing exhibited significant correlations in SC volume with the conventional procedure (r= 0. 931, P< 0. 001, r= 0. 925, P< 0. 001, respectively). Significance of flour particle size on SC baking performance was determined using flours of different particle size prepared by re-grinding and sieving. Particle size reduction of flour by re-grinding improved SC volume (0. 8 - 15. 0 %) and crumb grain, with little change in density and viscosity of the flour-water batter despite increases in flour starch damage (0. 1 - 0. 2 %) and sodium carbonate retention capacity (4. 8 - 13. 9 %). Flour fractions of small (< 55 µm) particles produced the largest SC volume, ranging from 1353 - 1450 mL. Even with comparable or higher protein content, flour fraction of intermediate particle size produced larger volume (1040 - 1195 mL) of SC than did flour fractions of large particle size (955 - 1130 mL). The qualitative and quantitative roles of starch on SC baking potential of wheat flour were investigated using flours of various amylose content as well as different quantities and proportions of starch in the baking formula. Normal and single-null partial waxy flours produced SCs ranging from 1093 to 1335 mL in volume, while double-null partial waxy and waxy wheat flours produced SC of 828 to 895 mL. Both amylose content and pasting properties (final viscosity and setback) of wheat flour exhibited significant positive relationships with SC volume. Amylose content of normal and waxy starch blends was significantly related with their SC volume (r= 0. 975, P< 0. 05). Pure wheat starch of over 80 g or more than 75 % starch in 100 g starch-gluten blends in replacement of 100 g wheat flour in the SC baking formula were needed to produce SC having the maximum volume potential.
