60|$|As an incontrovertible {{proof that}} those baleful {{attributes}} <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there,</b> Mrs Wilfer shuddered on the spot.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{she herself}} {{unfortunately}} isn't--that supplies the colour too." [...] Miss Gostrey <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>there.</b> But somehow--! [...] "Is HE in love?" ...|$|E
50|$|On 2002-02-16, Yadav and Katara {{attended}} a friends wedding in Ghaziabad. Bharti's mother, her brother Vikas and sister Bhavna <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> nonsense, you know, about {{shooting}} being a cruel sport. I put my skill {{against your}} cunning-that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> of it. It {{is a fair}} game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes"--his {{companion}} saw enough. [...] "Still, if {{the worst}} fault of his condition {{is that it}} may <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> for her to profit by--?" ...|$|R

6000|$|To Johnny Upright's house I came, and to {{the door}} came the [...] "slavey." [...] Now, mark you, her {{position}} in life was pitiable and contemptible, but it was with pity and contempt that she looked at me. She evinced a plain desire that our conversation should be short. It was Sunday, and Johnny Upright was not at home, and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> was to it. But I lingered, discussing {{whether or not it}} <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> was to it, till Mrs. Johnny Upright was attracted to the door, where she scolded the girl for not having closed it before turning her attention to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{made some}} words as women will, {{but she got}} ready, and she did look handsomer than ever as she came out. She was excited, I could see that, but she <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>there!</b> No jugglin' or fussin'.|$|E
