25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E

There <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and eager {{to talk about all}} over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E
2500|$|At The Guardian, Sam Jordison {{called it}} [...] "as complicated, daft, hilarious and {{satisfying}} as vintage PG Wodehouse: part kung fu epic, part philosophical novel, part mind-bending experiment with chaos theory (and a piss-take {{of those three}} things)", and categorized it as a book to [...] "give (readers) hope". At the SF Site, Steven H Silver observed that the book's parodying of action films is [...] "masterful", and commended Pratchett for how [...] "fresh" [...] the humor was—while conceding that [...] "reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... but there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> internal chuckling".|$|E

2500|$|Wyndham's {{performance}} was praised, {{and the play}} must have generated considerable interest: [...] On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was [...] "brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week.

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} was, above all else, {{a century of}} {{population}} growth; the twenty-=rst century <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a century of aging. Between 1900 and 2000 the world's population quadrupled, from around 1. 5 billion to over 6 billion. Most of this increase occurred after World War II. At present, {{it seems unlikely that}} the population will grow by more than about a further 50 percent. The most plausible forecasts see a population numbering between 9 and 10 billion by about 2050, with stability or decline in total population thereafter. However, the population at older ages will increase far more quickly in the coming century than in the last. Indeed, the end of population growth and its replacement by aging are logically related.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the 8 areas served us well over the years, {{providing}} a structure to the MSc (Level 1) curriculum and ensuring breadth of knowledge at entry level for aspiring Occupational Psychologists. Nevertheless, calls for the curriculum to change and be brought up-to-date have been voiced at regular intervals. An extensive report by an expert panel delivered to the Division in 2011 emphasized the need for change, now or never, so this is what a dedicated project board set out to do. This session will introduce and launch the new curriculum by explaining the consultative and iterative process taken, the rationale for the new and broader topic areas and also the new emphasis on practical as well as research skills. There <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> opportunity to ask any questions. For further information on the background for the project, please visit [URL]...|$|R
