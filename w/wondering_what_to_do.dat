25|$|Ellis proves her innocence to Canadian {{military}} intelligence {{and to the}} former Resistance leader Gerben Kuipers by means of Smaal's black book, which lists how many Jews (including Ellis's brother) had been taken to Akkermans for medical help just prior to their murders. Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse with the stolen money, gold and jewels. They quickly kill the driver, and while Kuipers drives the hearse, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents. They drive to Hollands Diep where the SS trap had been sprung, and wait until Akkermans suffocates. Ellis and Kuipers are left <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the stolen money and jewels.|$|E
25|$|While Commodore Jones and Captain Landais were {{fighting}} their unexpectedly separate battles, Captains Cottineau of the Pallas and Ricot of Vengeance were left <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In a well-organised formation, {{they might have}} been able to make a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, but there was no way to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat {{in a coffee shop}} one grey day, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" [...] This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as [...] "truth" [...] onto the web.|$|E

500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

2500|$|Sunbury Pop Festival was {{an annual}} Australian rock music festival {{that was the}} seventh {{of more than a}} dozen major outdoor rock festivals staged in Australia between 1970 and 1975, but it was the only one that became a {{continuing}} event, at least for four years.
