5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the translation.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni da Udine {{painted in}} Raphael's {{workshop}} in the 16th century. His Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough was a sketch for his Bird with Garland and Fruit, and {{this in turn}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a Raphael fresco in the Apostolic Palace.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the book}} was popular and commercially successful, going through 20 editions.

5|$|Scouting for Boys was {{published}} in England later in 1908 in book form. The book is now the fourth-bestselling title of all time, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the later American version of the Boy Scout Handbook.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, {{which gave the}} appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was born}} in Vilna in the Russian Empire (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) and emigrated to the United States in 1888. He lived in New York City, where he became {{involved}} in the anarchist movement. He was the one-time lover and lifelong friend of anarchist Emma Goldman. In 1892, undertaking an act of propaganda of the deed, Berkman made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate businessman Henry Clay Frick, for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> his first book, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist.|$|E

5|$|Charles Boycott and {{the events}} that led to his name {{entering}} the English language {{have been the subject of}} several works of fiction. The first was Captain Boycott, a 1946 romantic novel by Phillip Rooney. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 1947 film Captain Boycott—directed by Frank Lauder and starred Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Alastair Sim, and Cecil Parker as Charles Boycott. More recently the story was the subject of the 2012 novel Boycott, by Colin C. Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Compton Mackenzie, an English born Scottish novelist, {{acquired}} the tenancy. He recalled that his three years there had numerous logistical problems. It {{has been suggested}} that Mackenzie <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the character Mr Cathcart in D.H. Lawrence's The Man who Loved Islands, about a man who moved to ever smaller islands much as Mackenzie moved from Herm to the smaller Jethou, but Lawrence himself denied it. At one point Mackenzie threatened to sue. However, Mackenzie did love islands and would graduate from Herm to the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E

5|$|In {{each of its}} iterations, {{the brigade}} was not {{organized}} as a permanent formation. Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine division. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> {{the formation of the}} new 6th Marine Division, and the 1950 brigade acted as an advance force for the newly reactivated 1st Marine Division before merging into that unit.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class. In an ironic twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is the murderer and the man is the instigator. Leskov's novel <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Dmitri Shostakovich's 1936 opera of the same name.|$|E
5|$|McColley knew of {{only one}} {{surviving}} copy of the first edition, held at the British Museum (now British Library C.56.c.2), which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> his 1937 edition of The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.|$|E

5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission {{of light from the}} chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
5|$|RKO reissued Fantasia {{once more}} on September 1, 1946, with the {{animated}} sequences complete and {{the scenes of}} Taylor, Stokowski, and the orchestra restored but shortened. Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty-five minutes. This edit would be the standard form for subsequent re-releases, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 1990 restoration.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain.

5|$|The city {{hosted the}} 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics, {{attracting}} millions of visitors. Part {{of the infrastructure}} for the fair <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> major city institutions in Forest Park. In {{the early part of}} the century, many African Americans migrated from the South to the city for industrial jobs, as part of the Great Migration. St. Louis did not escape the Great Depression and its high unemployment. During World War II the city hosted war industries that employed thousands of workers.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's {{life was}} {{still waiting for}} independent, true {{scholarship}} when Richard Ellmann began researching his 1987 biography Oscar Wilde, for which he posthumously won a National (USA) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. The book <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 1997 film Wilde, directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry as the title character.|$|E
5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
