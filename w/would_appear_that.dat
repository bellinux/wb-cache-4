5|$|In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet Ribbentrop and Adolf Hitler. In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden visited Turkey in {{an attempt}} to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo-Turkish {{invasion}} of the Crimea. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E

5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that {{the killing of the}} three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E

25|$|Nachmanides' {{position}} here is untenable if {{he maintains}} that the Three Oaths are Halachically binding. Accordingly, it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Nachmanides implicitly rejects the Three Oaths as Halachically binding, and that to treat it as such would be to effectively nullify a biblical commandment.|$|E

25|$|The {{church was}} later rebuilt in the {{perpendicular}} gothic style, and although ostensibly Norman, {{some of the}} architectural furniture, for example the font, were of the Anglo-Saxon style (or at latest, early Norman), thus it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the church was rebuilt upon {{the site of the}} earlier building.|$|E
25|$|There are two orthographic {{systems in}} use for Pahawh Hmong, the second reduced stage from 1965 {{and the third}} reduced stage from 1970 (see history, below).

25|$|NET (0.5 to 3mg/day) {{has been}} found to dose-dependently {{decrease}} circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production. The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the androgenic activity of NET overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard.|$|E
25|$|By 1724, Pearce had {{returned}} to Ireland to become a practising architect in Dublin, It <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> as the only Irish architect, at the time, to have studied in Italy, his classical concepts were to win him instant recognition, his architectural success {{seems to have been}} almost instantaneous; no doubt helped by his contacts and position in Irish society and even more undoubtedly by his association with William Conolly and Castletown.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 the Ellan Vannin's regular sailings were {{augmented}} by summer cruises from Douglas via Castletown {{and on to the}} Calf of Mann. Also further pleasure cruises were added via Peel and onwards to the north of Ireland. It <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the vessel was being utilised to her maximum. Sailings to Whitehaven and Liverpool were maintained whilst sailings to Glasgow and from Liverpool to Dundrum via the Isle of Man were introduced.|$|E
50|$|Eldred {{was born}} about 1563, and lived {{to an old}} age, signing as a {{freeholder}} of Dover the Kentish petition for the reformation of the liturgy in 1641.

25|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} of {{a number}} of sites, later identified as Canaanite, show that prosperity of the region reached its apogee during this Middle Bronze Age period, under leadership of the city of Hazor, at least nominally tributary to Egypt for much of the period. In the north, the cities of Yamkhad and Qatna were hegemons of important confederacies, and it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> biblical Hazor was the chief city of another important coalition in the south.|$|E
25|$|The {{constraints}} {{in their}} primitive form are rather singular, {{this was the}} reason for integrating them over test functions to obtain smeared constraints. However, it <b>would</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the equation for the master constraint, given above, is even more singular involving the product of two primitive constraints (although integrated over space). Squaring the constraint is dangerous as it could lead to worsened ultraviolent behaviour of the corresponding operator and hence the master constraint programme must be approached with due care.|$|E

Hence the royal line and more general presence of humans in a nearby location did not directly threaten the witch.|$|E
