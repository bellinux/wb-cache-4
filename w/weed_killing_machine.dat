Already in 2006, Baerveldt and Astrand of Halmstad University were able to introduce {{one of the first}} weed-killing robots (Grift 2007). To date, other developers also try to establish such weed-killing robots as fully functional autonomous machines on the fields. Projects like BoniRob, an autonomous field robot to collect measured data of individual plants developed by the University of Applied Sciences Osnabrück in cooperation with Bosch and the Amazonen-Werke, have to be mentioned among others.

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with <b>weed</b> <b>killing</b> equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the <b>weed</b> <b>killing</b> pair had been withdrawn.|$|R
