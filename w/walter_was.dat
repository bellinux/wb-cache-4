5|$|Hubert <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Hervey Walter and {{his wife}} Maud de Valoignes, one of the daughters (and co-heiresses) of Theobald de Valoignes, who was lord of Parham in Suffolk. <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> one of six brothers.

Glanvill was the chief justiciar for Henry II; and was married to Maud de Valoignes' sister, Bertha. Walter's father and {{paternal}} grandfather held lands in Suffolk and Norfolk, which were inherited by Theobald. A younger brother, Osbert, became a royal justice and died in 1206.

5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|The parliament's {{discussions on}} Anglo-Scottish {{relations}} preceded peace negotiations {{later in the}} year, at which Bishop <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> one of the Scottish envoys.

King David travelled to London, where he resided in May and June, in order {{to take part in the}} negotiations. Walter and the rest of the embassy, which included four other bishops, were in London by June 1369, the month in which Edward agreed to a new truce.

5|$|<b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> {{a witness}} on 12 of Henry's royal {{charters}}, all before 1131. He {{also was a}} witness for some royal charters issued by Henry's successor, King Stephen of England, early in Stephen's reign. One was a charter issued at Henry's funeral on 4 January 1136 and another at Stephen's court at Easter 1136. These two charter attestations {{show that he was}} an early supporter of Stephen in the king's seizure of the throne from Henry's daughter Matilda. These early charters from Stephen's reign are Walter's last appearances in documents during his lifetime.

5|$|Alice {{returned}} to the Holy Land in 1233.

5|$|Besides sending Walter on {{diplomatic}} missions, King John gave Walter {{custody of}} Rochester Castle on 20 July 1202, but as <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> already {{accounting for the}} taxes and fees {{of the city of}} Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is possible that he held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1361 of William de Cambuslang, Bishop of Dunblane, <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> {{elected by the}} Dunblane cathedral chapter {{to be the new}} bishop.

5|$|<b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> {{given the}} lordship of Weobley in Herefordshire after the Conquest. He is already attested in the Welsh Marches by 1069, {{when he is}} {{recorded}} stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution. Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of King William the Conqueror. Although some historians, such as W. E. Wightman, have argued that <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> a follower of William fitzOsbern, others, including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, have argued that <b>Walter</b> <b>was</b> an independent agent in England. By the time of Walter's death, he held a block of lands in Herefordshire {{along the border with}} Wales. Another group of lands was centered on Ludlow in Shropshire. These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids. Walter also had other lands in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Oxfordshire. Walter kept a large number of his manors in demesne, managing them directly rather than giving them as fiefs to his knightly followers. Some of these lands in Hereford, including Holme Lacy, were held of the Bishop of Hereford through feudal tenure. In total, Domesday Book records Walter's lands as being worth £423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties. He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than £400 {{at the time of the}} survey.|$|E

When he was five years old, his father was posted to Hong Kong {{to serve on the}} China Station and promoted to sergeant. The family remained there until 1911, followed by a posting to Malta until 1914. Hammond later recalled playing cricket in Malta using improvised equipment, including a soldier's old bat which he believed taught him to strike the ball powerfully.|$|E
