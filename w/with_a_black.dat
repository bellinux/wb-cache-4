5|$|The colours {{used by the}} {{original}} Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> and white striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, {{the black and white}} colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001–02 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007–08, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.|$|E

5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of the Klan for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E

5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black leotard. The last scenes show her on a swing, swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, {{he was able to}} speak with less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
