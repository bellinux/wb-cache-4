25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E

2500|$|This {{resulted}} in the Education Reform Act 1990 (NSW) (now the Education Act 1990). Prior to its assent on 1 June 1990, school education in New South Wales had been provided under a law developed 110 years earlier by Henry Parkes and William Wilkins in their [...] "Public Instruction Act 1880 (NSW)". On {{the significance of this}} law, Metherell said in early 1990: [...] "Chifley in his time was thought of as somewhat of an ogre, but now <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> back on Ben Chifley we reflect upon his statesmanship.

2500|$|Like Hero, Ptolemy in his Optics (preserved only in {{the form}} of a Latin {{translation}} of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone. [...] Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density. [...] He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.|$|E

2500|$|Consequently, Schiller {{rejects the}} idea that {{statements}} can have meaning or truth when they are looked upon in the abstract, away from a particular context. [...] "Diamonds are hard" [...] only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person’s purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person’s purposes that constitutes the statement’s truth or falsity. After all, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the sentence [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] in a particular situation we may find it actually has {{nothing to say about}} diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply {{as an example of a}} sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context.|$|E
2500|$|L.R. Farnell assumed [...] "that sun-worship {{had once}} been {{prevalent}} and powerful among {{the people of the}} pre-Hellenic culture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion." [...] Our largely Attic literary sources tend to give us an unavoidable Athenian bias <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at ancient Greek religion, and [...] "no Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene," [...] J. Burnet observes, [...] "but he might think them to be gods, since Helios was the great god of Rhodes and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere." [...] James A. Notopoulos considers Burnet's an artificial distinction: [...] "To believe in the existence of the gods involves acknowledgment through worship, as Laws 87D, E shows" [...] (note, p.264). Aristophanes' Peace (406-413) contrasts the worship of Helios and Selene with that of the more essentially Greek Twelve Olympians, as the representative gods of the Achaemenid Persians; all the evidence shows that Helios and Selene were minor gods to the Greeks.|$|E

2500|$|Trilogy {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 19 reviews. John Calvert of Fact dubbed it [...] "an r'n'b album with few equals {{in terms of}} narrational ambition". Oliver Keens of Time Out wrote that The Weeknd [...] "communicates" [...] his character [...] "so engagingly on Trilogy" [...] and found him [...] "riveting when he juxtaposes debauchery with a delivery that finds him numb and {{on the verge of}} tears". Killian Fox of The Observer felt that the mixtapes' [...] "production sounded great to start with" [...] and that the [...] "new material is unexceptional", but ultimately stated, [...] "if you didn't pick up the mixtapes when they were going free, and can handle 160 minutes of beautifully crafted nihilism, this is an essential buy." [...] Although he found the new songs [...] "arbitrary in terms of sequencing", Pitchforks Ian Cohen cited the compilation as [...] "some of the best music of the young decade; judging by its already pervasive influence, it's safe to say Trilogy (or at least House of Balloons) will be one of those records that will be viewed as a turning point <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the 2010s as a whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, response to the ode by critics was mostly positive. Andrew Bradley declared in 1909 that [...] "The Immortality Ode, like King Lear, is its author's greatest product, but not his best piece of work." [...] When speaking of Grasmere and Wordsworth, Elias Sneath wrote in 1912: [...] "It witnessed the composition {{of a large number of}} poems, many of which may be regarded among the finest products of his imagination. Most of them have already been considered. However, one remains which, in the judgment of some critics, more than any other poem of the numerous creations of his genius, entitles him to a seat among the Immortals. This is the celebrated ... It is, in some respects, one of his most important works, whether viewed from the stand point of mere art, or from that of poetic insight." [...] George Harper, following Sneath in 1916, described the poem in positive terms and said, [...] "Its radiance comes and goes through a shimmering veil. Yet, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> close, we find nothing unreal or unfinished. This beauty, though supernal, is not evanescent. It bides our return, and whoever comes to seek it as a little child will find it. The imagery, though changing at every turn, is fresh and simple. The language, though connected with thoughts so serious that they impart to it a classic dignity, is natural and for the most part plain.... Nevertheless, a peculiar glamour surrounds the poem. It is the supreme example of what I may venture to term the romance of philosophic thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} figures {{provide a}} visual illustration {{of how the}} Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function [...] oscillates at 3Hz (if [...] measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an envelope function that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a Gaussian function). This function was specially chosen {{to have a real}} Fourier transform that can easily be plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate [...] we must integrate [...] The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when [...] is negative, the real part of [...] is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when [...] is positive, so is the real part of [...] The result is that when you integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case [...] ). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at , you see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.|$|E
