6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> you, dear?" [...] Mrs. Gildersleeve asked, {{with that}} frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Mr. Dunham {{has been}} talking me over with you, has he? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> you of me? There is nobody like a true friend for dealing an underhand blow at one's reputation. Wait till you hear my account of Dunham! What did he say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. <b>What</b> should <b>he</b> have <b>done?</b> How am I to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does?</b> <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> me nothing. Don't {{talk about}} it any more. Oh, God,--how much better {{it would be to}} be childless!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> say?" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "What are {{his reasons}} for staying away? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> you about his plans? Read us the letter. You can leave out all the loving and {{confidential}} parts, but give us his explanations. I never was so anxious to know anything in all my life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Poor old thing!" [...] They {{had been}} walking round the farms as usual before tea. [...] "No wonder they loved it. Think of the sacrifices they made for it.

60|$|Well, <b>what</b> more <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> us? Another thing, remember, {{essential}} to an eagle {{is that it}} should fly fast. It is no use its having wings at all {{if it is to}} be impeded in the use of them. Now it would be difficult to impede him more thoroughly than by giving him two cocked ears to catch the wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> you, {{whether it}} is wrong or right. If it's right, {{it ought to be}} done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's smart enough, but" [...] . Mrs. Andrews {{lowered her}} voice [...] "I believe he tells queer stories.

6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think," [...] Father Adrian {{commenced}} slowly, [...] "that your {{father told me}} {{the whole history of}} his life.

40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of the modern study of evodevo is to {{understand}} the evolution of gene function {{across a range of}} contexts, including sub/neofunctionalization, co-option of genetic modules, and the evolution of morphological novelty. To these ends, comparative studies of gene expression can be useful for constructing hypotheses, but cannot provide direct evidence of functional evolution. Unfortunately, determining endogenous gene function in non-model species is often not an option. Faced with this dilemma, a common approach is to use heterologous expression (HE) in genetically tractable model species as a proxy for functional analyses. Such experiments have important limitations, however, and require caution in the interpretation of their results. How do we dissociate biochemical function from its original genomic context? In the end, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>HE</b> actually <b>tell</b> us? Here, I argue that HE only sheds light on specific types of biochemical conservation, but can be useful when experiments are carefully interpreted...|$|R

The officer has a brother, an astute, daring, unscrupulous man, who learns the clergyman's secret. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Tell</b> his brother, inform the police? No; upon this man also the Satanic charm has fallen; he must have the stone for himself. At the risk of murder, he drugs the young priest and seizes the prey. And now, by an accident which is not important to my moral, the jewel passes out of his custody into that of another, who, terrified at what he sees, gives it into the keeping of a man in high station and above reproach.|$|R
