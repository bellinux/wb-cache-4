5|$|Akroinon {{was a major}} {{success for}} the Byzantines, {{as it was the}} first {{large-scale}} victory they had scored in a pitched battle against the Arabs. Seeing it as evidence of God's renewed favour, the victory also served to strengthen Leo's belief in the policy of iconoclasm that he had adopted some years before. In the immediate aftermath, this success opened up the way for a more aggressive stance by the Byzantines, who in 741 attacked the major Arab base of Melitene. In 742 and 743, the Umayyads were able to exploit a civil war between Constantine V and Artabasdos and raid into Anatolia <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> impunity, but the Arab sources do not report any major achievements.|$|E

5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy {{could keep the}} German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Though {{research}} suggests {{support for the}} association between marital quality and anxiety disorders, less is known about relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> and friends and anxiety dis-orders. Method: Using data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (n = 9912; mean age 44. 8; 52. 2 % female), the association between relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>relatives,</b> friends, and romantic partners and anxiety disorders is examined {{for those who are}} divorced, single, or married. Results: For those who are single or divorced, relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> and friends was associated with many anxiety disorders including agoraphobia, social phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. For those who are married, relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> and partners was associated with generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: Given that those with anxiety disorders have higher rates of divorce {{and are more likely to}} be single, examining the relationship quality <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> and friends, in addition to romantic partners, may be important for understanding the onset and course of anxiety disorders.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Strong {{relationships}} <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> may {{alleviate the}} consequences of stressful experiences, but the evidence documenting such ‘buffering effect’ during parenthood is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This paper investigated the buffering effect of relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> during parenthood in Switzerland. We tested if relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> (network size, frequency of contact, and availability of practical and emotional support) became activated in response to parenthood, and if people who had stronger relationships <b>with</b> their <b>relatives</b> experienced more positive trajectories of life satisfaction during parenthood. METHODS: We used Swiss Household Panel data for years 2000 - 2011 and fixed effect regression models. RESULTS: A birth of a first child was associated {{with an increase in}} mothers’ contact <b>with</b> non-resident <b>relatives.</b> Moreover, parents <b>with</b> at least two children who had better access to support from relatives experienced more increase and less decline in life satisfaction during parenthood than parents who had worse access to relatives’ support. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the support of relatives is a resource for parents having two or more children and that it improves the experience of parenthood even in a relatively wealthy society. CONTRIBUTION: This is the first paper which demonstrates that relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> diversify the effect of parenthood on life satisfaction. Moreover, it suggests that weak relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> may lower life satisfaction of parents and limit fertility, especially at higher parities...|$|R

5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> ease.|$|E

40|$|Strong {{relationships}} <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> may alleviate {{consequences of}} stressful experiences, {{but the evidence}} documenting such ‘buffering effect’ during parenthood is scarce. This paper investigated the buffering effect of relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> during parenthood in Switzerland. We tested if relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> (network size, frequency of contact, and availability of practical and emotional support) became stronger in response to parenthood, and if people who had stronger relationships <b>with</b> their <b>relatives</b> experienced more positive trajectories of life satisfaction during parenthood. We used Swiss Household Panel data for years 2000 - 2011 and fixed effects regression models. Our {{results showed that the}} birth of the first child increased the frequency of mothers’ contact <b>with</b> non-resident <b>relatives,</b> which is in line with buffering effect. However, contrary to our hypotheses, fathers of three children experienced erosion of relatives’ network and decreased availability of emotional support. We found mixed evidence that strong relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> improve parental life satisfaction. Parents with at least two children who had stronger relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives</b> experienced more increase (and less decline) in life satisfaction during parenthood than those who had weaker relationships <b>with</b> <b>relatives.</b> However, results concerning the first child is against our buffering effect hypothesis, with parents, especially mothers, experiencing higher level of satisfaction when the relatives network size, contact or support are low. Our additional analysis on this respect shows that this group is positively selected as to the pre-birth level of happiness. Our study suggests that support from relatives is a resource for parents having two or more children and that it improves the experience of parenthood even in relatively wealthy societies...|$|R

5|$|The winning design, the English Electric Canberra, also {{dispensed}} with defensive armaments, producing a design {{with the speed}} that allowed it to fly past most defences.

5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met <b>with</b> <b>relative</b> neglect.|$|E
