5000|$|Water {{is removed}} from the sample in {{successive}} stages by the use of increasing concentrations of alcohol. Xylene is used in the last dehydration phase instead of alcohol - this is because the wax used in the next stage is soluble in xylene where it is not in alcohol allowing wax to permeate (infiltrate) the specimen. This process is generally automated and done overnight. The wax infiltrated specimen is then transferred to an individual specimen embedding (usually metal) container. Finally, molten wax is introduced around the specimen in the container and cooled to solidification so as to embed it in the <b>wax</b> <b>block.</b> [...] This process is needed to provide a properly oriented sample sturdy enough for obtaining a thin microtome section(s) for the slide.|$|E

Bait consumption was significantly higher across treatments (P≤. 001) for granulated sorghum, followed by pelleted sorghum, and wax blocks. Gophers also showed a high frequency of moving the granulated bait in their cheek pouches to be deposited at alternate locations within their cages. Although increasing sucrose concentration did not produce significantly (P ≥. 10) enhanced consumption {{for any of the}} baits, a trend toward increasing preference with increased concentration was noted for the <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> bait. During quinine tests, bait consumption was again significantly highest (P≤. 01) for granulated sorghum followed by pelleted sorghum and <b>wax</b> <b>block.</b> Quinine treatment also failed to significantly (P≥. 10) alter bait consumption across the tested concentrations. However, there was a minor trend toward decreasing preference with increasing concentrations in the <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> group. Data indicated that pelleted bait had the advantage of producing more consistent consumption levels without the animals carrying bait in their cheek pouches for caching and subsequent spillage. Although the <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> baits were most influenced by the taste treatments, consumption levels were extremely low. In comparison with most wild rodent species, northern pocket gophers were found to be insensitive or indifferent to both taste stimuli over a wide concentration range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} {{the potential for}} mortality or sublethal effects in the tree weta (Hemideina crassidens) {{as the result of}} exposure to baits used for rodent control, and the potential secondary hazard to non-target species, captive weta were offered Ditrac ® <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> bait containing the anticoagulant diphacinone. Bait consumption was recorded daily for the first week and then weekly. Weta were sampled in groups of four following 1, 4, 8, 16, 31, and 64 days of exposure to bait and analysed to determine the concentration of diphacinone residues in their bodies. Any changes in feeding behaviour, survival, and bodyweight were recorded. Weta found Ditrac <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> baits palatable even in the presence of natural plant food, showing steady consumption of bait over time. No mortality or weight loss was attributable to the intake of Ditrac bait. All weta that ate bait had detectable diphacinone in their bodies, but did not accumulate diphacinone, i. e. whole-body concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten over time. Field use of diphacinone bait is likely to present a low risk of mortality to weta, but the risk posed by secondary diphacinone exposure to non-target species that eat weta requires further investigation. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have established a}} link between the presence of house mouse (Mus domesticus) infestations and detrimental effects on human health. Controlling mouse infestations therefore requires methods that are quick, safe and effective. A tamper-resistant bait station with a <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> which is manufactured to fit within it so that it cannot be shaken out is considered the safest way to present the bait. However, some authors have expressed concern about the efficacy of this method. Research {{to examine the effects of}} bait stations on the feeding of mice infesting domestic dwellings was undertaken in the city of Manchester, UK. Working in conjunction with Manchester City Council, suitable sites were found. A balanced Latin Square experimental design was employed to overcome any operational biases that could have occurred. Non-toxic baits were presented in one of four ways: whole wheat in a cardboard box; whole wheat in a open tray; whole wheat in a tamper-resistant box; and a non-toxic <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> in a tamper-resistant box. Baits were placed in four different locations within dwellings and during the feeding trial; the bait stations were rotated, so that each bait type was presented in each location. The bait take from 12 dwellings within 3 housing blocks was recorded. Three-quarters of the bait consumed during the trial was taken from the cardboard box. No bait was taken from the tamper-resistant box containing the <b>wax</b> <b>block.</b> Risk assessments should drive the approach adopted in presenting rodenticide. Dwellings where vulnerable adults/children/pets are present may represent a risk of accidental poisoning may require a regime with tamper-resistant bait boxes containing wax blocks, to prevent baits being accessed. However, a balance between the safest and the most effective presentation of bait is needed and in areas where there is unlikely to be any access to baits (e. g. behind kitchen kickboards), use of alternatives must remain to ensure the shift resolution of infestations. Where bait can be placed safely and there are no children or pets present, cardboard boxes provide an effective means of ensuring that bait is consumed by the mice infesting domestic dwellings...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Hypertension {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus are frequently encountered in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients {{at the age of}} 65 years and above. Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), known as a potent vasoconstrictor, has been implicated in pathogenesis of essential hypertension and diabetic vascular complications. High level of ET- 1 was observed in osteoarthritic cartilage. The unanswered question was whether the sustained high level of ET- 1 would induce development of OA. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypes of articular cartilage and subchondral bone in transgenic mice with endothelial cellspecific overexpression of ET- 1 (TET- 1 mice). Materials and Methods: Male heterozygous TET- 1 mice were generated by microinjection of the ET- 1 construct driven by Tie- 1 promoter. These TET- 1 mice developed systemic hypertension with altered vascular reactivity since 8 weeks after birth. Tibiae of male, heterozygous TET- 1 mice (n = 4) and their littermates (n = 4) of 35 -week-old were obtained. Microcomputed tomographic (Micro-CT) scan on tibiae were performed before tissue processed to <b>wax</b> <b>blocks.</b> Tibiae in <b>wax</b> <b>blocks</b> were sectioned for histology. Results: The Micro-CT data showed a decrease of mean (± standard deviation) trabecular bone density (10. 9 ± 0. 4 %) in primary spongiosa of TET- 1 mice compared with the littermates (12. 8 ± 0. 5 %; p < 0. 05). Histologically, articular chondrocytes underwent hypertrophic changes together with thickening of calcified cartilage in TET- 1 mice when compared with their littermates. Discussion and Conclusion: Endothelial-specific overexpression of ET- 1 induced OA-like changes, which might be a therapeutic target...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} Plotinus’ {{account of the}} soul’s {{cognitive}} powers of sense perception and discursive thought, with particular reference to the treatises 3. 6 [26], 4. 4 [28] and 5. 3 [49] of the Enneads. Part 1 of the paper discusses Plotinus’ direct realism in perception. Parts 2 and 3 focus on Plotinus’ account of knowledge in Enneads 5. 3 [49] 2 – 3. Plotinus there argues that we make judgements regarding how the external world is by means of discursive reasoning. This latter claim, however, is in tension with what Plotinus argues elsewhere regarding our perceptual apprehension of the external world (3. 6 [26] 1; 4. 4 [28] 23). This puzzle is addressed in Part 3 of the paper, which investigates Plotinus’ view that there exist some sense perceptions {{of which we are}} unaware.

40|$|Background: Tissue micro-array {{enables the}} {{analysis}} {{of a large number}} of tissues simultaneously. Widespread use of this technology is hampered by the high cost of commercial array instruments. We describe our experience of constructing tissue micro-array in a simple method using easily available and inexpensive instruments. Materials and Methods: We used an 11 - 19 gauge (G) bone marrow trephine biopsy needle/ small sized slotted screwdriver to punch holes in the <b>wax</b> <b>blocks.</b> Cores were taken from donor tissue blocks using a bone marrow trephine biopsy needle and arrayed into host paraffin <b>wax</b> <b>blocks.</b> A detailed database was constructed for each array constructed. Results: The array blocks were used over a period of one year as internal control for immunohistochemistry (IHC), quality control and research. It took about 10 minutes to construct a nine-dot array and about one hour for a 56 -dot array. During IHC, the average loss of control dots was less than one per cent. We did not see any loss of antigenicity in the control sections even after four weeks storage. Discussion: Tissue array construction by the technique described here is inexpensive and reliable alternative to automated instruments. Because it is easy to modify the arrays by varying the core size, it is easy to adapt this to individual labs and requirements. We recommend using blocks with cores in 3 x 3 to 5 x 4 grids as controls in IHC and for standardizing antibodies and array blocks with a larger number of cores for research...|$|R

Maize-based baits were used traditionally to control ricefield rodents. This study aimed to determine if replacing maize with rice as bait base would increase uptake of zinc phosphide and warfarin <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> baits in maturing rice crops, fallow fields and villages. The study site was in lowland ricefields in Cambodia. Nineteen experimental plots {{were placed in the}} three habitats, with three/four plots treated with zinc phosphide and three with warfarin per habitat. Each plot consisted of five bait points each with rice and maize-based toxic and non-toxic baits. Mean bait uptake was increased by 65 % through replacing maize with rice as the base. Such increase was greater with warfarin being the active ingredient than with zinc phosphide, but both increases were substantial (62 % and 51 %). The increase was high in villages (85 %) and maturing rice crops (79 %), and lower in fallow fields (49 %). We recommend that rice be the base in both baits. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This {{study examined}} the effects on proximal tubule morphology of blocking single nephrons with paraffin wax for one day, one week, or one month in the rat. Proximal tubule lumens were blocked with a short column of wax using micropuncture. Chronically blocked and control (normal) tubules were fixed by either intravascular or intraluminal perfusion of glutaraldehyde solution. Proximal tubule segments down-stream to the <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Intraluminal Alcian blue dye, serial sectioning, and nephron microdissection techniques were used to identify nephrons. One day after obstruction, all proximal tubule cells downstream to the block were injured. Some recovery was seen. S 1 and S 2 segments showed more severe damage than S 3 segments. Alcian blue, which normally is excluded from cells, entered the cytoplasm of some damaged S 1 -S 2 cells. After one week of obstruction, the tubule appeared to have reconstituted itself, but cells were less differentiated than normal. One month after obstruction, blocked tubules were atrophied. Tubule cells were simplified and were surrounded by a thickened basement membrane. The results suggest that prolonged proximal tubule blockade produces injury and atrophy of the proximal tubule probably due to ischemia and interruption of normal reabsorptive activity...|$|E

Examples of various aversive agent categories are given, including odorants, tastants, and emetics, with examples of evaluations. Tastant additives have been found that do not interfere with rodenticidal efficacy. Denatonium benzoate (commercially available as Bitrex®) is an intensely bitter but non-toxic substance, being increasingly used to adulterate common household materials to reduce the potential risks involved with accidental exposures. No known prior research results have been published concerning the incorporation of Bitrex in rodenticides. Rate determination studies utilizing different rodenticidal formulations were conducted. A Bitrex level of 10 ppm was well accepted by wild commensal rats and mice in laboratory tests of brodifacoum pellet and <b>wax</b> <b>block</b> formulations (TALON®, KLERAT® Rodenticides). Bait samples with this level of Bitrex (without anticoagulant) were evaluated in a human taste panel study. Samples with Bitrex were found to show significantly greater average rejection by the panel than similar samples without Bitrex. Field trial results are reviewed, which verified the efficacy of Bitrexcontaining commensal rodenticides. The potential role of Bitrex or similar taste deterrents as rodenticide additives is considered opposite accidental toxicant exposure statistics, and perceptions relating to rodenticides and other pesticides...|$|E

Baiting {{in and around the}} village houses was already carried out during the first two applications. On average, only 1. 175 kg/ha/season of flocoumafen block bait gave good rodent control resulting in significant decreases in crop damage (% cut tillers) compared to the untreated area.

40|$|The {{acceptance}} of four anticoagulant rodenticide baits was evaluated in a piggery. The bait bases were cracked wheat, <b>wax</b> <b>block,</b> pig feed, and Racumin Paste(R). Mean daily consumption of each bait was poor (< 5 g). Mean activity index measured with tracking plates {{did not change}} significantly throughout pre-baiting (3 days), baiting (37) or post-baiting (7), indicating that the baits had {{no impact on the}} population. The same baiting regime applied simultaneously in nearby stables with lower feed availability induced a significantly higher mean consumption of the cracked wheat based bait, and the activity index declined to zero at day 23, indicating that the rats were eradicated. The failure of the baits to control rats in the piggery was possibly due to the poor bait acceptance caused by the abundant feed supply. Results of live-trapping and radio- and spool-and-line tracking indicated that the population was confined within the piggery; lower windowsills were the most used above-ground structure for movements; and minimum home range span was 17 m. We suggest that rodent control should be implemented {{within the confines of the}} piggery to reduce the risk to non-target animals, and that mortality agents should be placed less than or equal to 17 in apart arboreally for the roof rat.

Some {{of the limitations}} and problems associated with image analysis which came to light included an unacceptably high coefficient of variation (CV) and a "left-shift" in the DI in most DNA histograms obtained when using image analysis of 5 microns sections. In contrast, the DNA histograms generated using image analysis of cytospun nuclei from paraffin <b>wax</b> <b>blocks</b> were of good quality and similar to those obtained using flow cytometry. Variability in Feulgen staining was common and {{an important source of}} error despite rigorous control of the staining technique. This could be overcome by using internal controls such as fibroblasts rather than external controls (rat hepatocytes) to determine the diploid DI with image analysis. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the methodological problems associated with image analysis and flow cytometric determination of DNA content is required before these methods find widespread clinical application...|$|R
