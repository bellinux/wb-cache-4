40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{researchers}} use descriptive distributions such as the ex-Gaussian and the shifted Wald to summarize response time data for speeded two-choice tasks. Some of these researchers also assume that {{the parameters of the}}se distributions uniquely correspond to specific cognitive processes. We studied the validity of this cognitive interpretation by relating the parameters of the ex-Gaussian and shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distributions</b> to those of the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model whose parameters have well-established cognitive interpretations. In a simulation study, we fitted the ex-Gaussian and shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distributions</b> to data generated from the diffusion model by systematically varying its parameters across a wide range of plausible values. In an empirical study, the two descriptive distributions were fitted to published data that featured manipulations of task difficulty, response caution, and a priori bias. The results clearly demonstrate that the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters do not correspond uniquely to parameters of the diffusion model. We conclude that researchers should resist the temptation to interpret changes in the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters in terms of cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|The most {{powerful}} tests of response time (RT) models often involve the whole {{shape of the}} RT distribution, thus avoiding mimicking that can occur {{at the level of}} RT means and variances. Nonparametric distribution estimation is, in principle, the most appropriate approach, but such estimators are sometimes difficult to obtain. On the other hand, distribution fitting, given an algebraic function, is both easy and compact. We review the general approach to performing distribution fitting with maximum likelihood (ML) and a method based on quantiles (quantile maximum probability, QMP). We show that QMP has both small bias and good efficiency when used with common distribution functions (the ex-Gaussian, Gumbel, lognormal, <b>Wald,</b> and Weibull <b>distributions).</b> In addition, we review some software packages performing ML (PASTIS, QMPE, DISFIT, and MATHEMATICA) and compare their results. In general, the differences between packages have little influence on the optimal solution found, but the form of the distribution function has: Both the lognormal and the <b>Wald</b> <b>distributions</b> have nonlinear dependencies between the parameter estimates that tend to increase the overall bias in parameter recovery and to decrease efficiency. We conclude by laying out a few pointers on how to relate descriptive models of RT to cognitive models of RT.

40|$|Inferring {{processes}} or constructs from {{performance data}} {{is a major}} hallmark of cognitive psychometrics. Particularly, diffusion modeling of response times (RTs) from correct and erroneous responses using the Wiener distribution has become a popular measurement tool because it provides a set of psychologically interpretable parameters. However, an important precondition to identify all of these parameters is {{a sufficient number of}} RTs from erroneous responses. In the present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener distribution can be recovered from tasks yielding very high or even perfect response accuracies using the shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution.</b> Specifically, we argue that error RTs can be modeled as correct RTs that have undergone censoring by using techniques from parametric survival analysis. We illustrate our reasoning by fitting the Wiener and (censored) shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution</b> to RTs from six participants who completed a Go/No-go task. In accordance with our simulations, diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution</b> yielded identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous responses was predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as censored correct RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion parameters when premature trial timeout was introduced {{to increase the number of}} omission errors. Thus, the censored shifted <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution</b> provides a suitable means for diffusion modeling in situations when the Wiener distribution cannot be fitted without parametric constraints.

40|$|Abstract. Quantitative {{assessment}} of myelin density {{in the white}} mat-ter is an emerging tool for neurodegenerative disease related studies such as multiple sclerosis and Schizophrenia. For the last two decades, T 2 re-laxometry based on multi-exponential fitting to a single slice multi-echo sequence {{has been the most}} common MRI technique for myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping, where the short T 2 is associated with myelin water. However, modeling the spectrum of the relaxations as the sum of large number of impulse functions with unknown amplitudes makes the accuracy and robustness of the estimated MWF’s questionable. In this paper, we introduce a novel model with small number of parameters to simultaneously characterize transverse relaxation rate spectrum and B 1 inhomogeneity at each voxel. We use mixture of three <b>Wald</b> <b>distributions</b> with unknown mixture weights, mean and shape parameters to represent the distribution of the relative amount of water in between myelin sheets, tissue water, and cerebrospinal fluid. The parameters of the model are estimated using the variable projection method and are used to extract the MWF at each voxel. In addition, we use Extended Phase Graph (EPG) method to compensate for the stimulated echoes caused by B 1 inhomogeneity. To validate our model, synthetic and real brain experi-ments were conducted where we have compared our novel algorithm with the non-negative least squares (NNLS) as the state-of-the-art technique in the literature. Our results indicate that we can estimate MWF map with substantially higher accuracy as compared to the NNLS method...|$|R

30|$|This {{stability}} theorem {{makes sure}} that the convergence of distribution functions is reflected by corresponding convergence of the functions q 1 (x), q 2 (x) and η(x) respectively. It guarantees, for instance, the ‘convergence’ of characterization of the <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution</b> {{to that of the}} Levy-Smirnov distribution if α[*]→[*]∞. A further consequence of the stability property of Theorem 1 is the application of this theorem to special tasks in statistical practice such as the estimation of the parameters of discrete distributions. For such purpose, the functions q 1 (x), q 2 (x) and, specially,η(x) should be as simple as possible. Since the function triplet is not uniquely determined it is often possible to choose η(x) as a linear function. Therefore, it is worth analyzing some special cases which helps to find new characterizations reflecting the relationship between individual continuous univariate distributions and appropriate in other areas of statistics.|$|E

Methods. We analysed 9829 adults representative of the general population within the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Two psychosis syndromes, derived from the SCL- 90 -R, were applied: ‘schizotypal signs' and ‘schizophrenia nuclear symptoms'. Results. Only a few subjects (13. 2 %) reported no schizotypal signs. While 33. 2 % of subjects indicated mild signs, only a small proportion (3. 7 %) reported severe signs. A very common outcome was no ‘schizophrenia nuclear symptoms' (70. 6 %). Although 13. 5 % of the participants reported mild symptoms, severe nuclear symptoms were very rare (0. 5 %). Because these two syndromes were only moderately correlated (r= 0. 43), we were able to establish sufficiently distinct symptom clusters. Schizotypal signs were more closely connected to distress than was schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, even though their distribution types were similar. Both syndromes were associated with several covariates, such as alcohol and tobacco use, being unmarried, low education level, psychopathological distress and low subjective well-being. Conclusions. Subclinical psychosis symptoms are quite frequent in the general population but, for the most part, are not very pronounced. In particular, our data support the notion of a continuous <b>Wald</b> <b>distribution</b> of psychotic symptoms in the general population. Our findings have enabled us to confirm the usefulness of these syndromes as previously assessed in other independent community samples.

In cases in which CML does not fail, a Monte Carlo investigation showed that QMP estimates were usually as good, {{and in some cases}} better, than CML estimates.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how {{to estimate the}} alternative model that admits a one-time break in coeffcients of a linear regression function and variances of the errors. Bai and Perron (1998) introduced an estimation and testing procedure for multiple breaks in regression coeffcients. We {{limit the number of}} breaks to one but extend the estimation to the alternative model that allows for variances of the errors to break too. The method is based on application of specific objective functions in conjunction with the tests ofstructural change. In particular, sup-Wald test of Andrews (1993) can be used to detect structural breaks. Andrews and Ploberger (1994) introduce optimal tests of constancy of model parameters when the change point is unknown. However, these tests lose their power optimality properties when the break happens in both the mean and the variance of a process. For such an alternative we introduce a statistic with a modified measure of a distance between model parameters before and after the break. In a Monte-Carlo experiment we show that the power of the corresponding sup-test dominates that of the sup-Wald test. If a change point is known, then the test based on this statistic is uniformly more powerful than the Wald test.

40|$|Discrete {{time series}} data {{is seen in}} a wide variety of {{disciplines}} including biology, medicine, psychology, criminology and economics. However, traditional methods of detecting serial correlation in time series are not specifically designed for detecting serial dependence in discrete valued time series. Thus new methods are needed to provide informative and implementable testing approaches. This thesis is concerned with detection and estimation of serial dependence for a variety of observation driven and parameter driven models for regression analysis in binary and binomial time series. Generalized linear models (GLM) are widely used in modelling discrete valued data but do not allow for serial dependence and as a result inferences about regression effects may be invalid for time series application. Two classes of extended generalized linear models have arisen to deal with this issue: observation driven models and parameter driven models in which the serial dependence of the former relies on previous observations and residuals and the serial dependence of the latter derives from an unobserved latent process. This thesis is structured in two parts corresponding to these two model classes. Chapter 1 provides a review of these models and existing methods for detecting and estimating serial dependence in them. Chapters 2 to 4 focus on observation driven models and Chapters 5 to 7 on parameter driven models. Chapter 8 distills the main results and conclusions from the thesis and suggests future research opportunities. The thesis proposes the use of score tests because they can be implemented using standard generalized linear model fitting software or, for the parameter driven models, software for fitting generalized linear mixed models, which is also readily available in most advanced statistical packages. Chapter 2 reviews two sub classes of the observation driven model group: generalized linear autoregressive moving average models (GLARMA) and binomial autoregressive and moving average models (BARMA). Score tests for detecting serial dependence are derived for a variety of specifications of the innovations used to define the state equation for these models. The score test can be implemented using the generalized linear model estimates of regression parameters. Likelihood ratio test (LRT) and Wald test are also defined. Two situations are considered: firstly the regular case where there are no nuisance parameters arising in the specification of serial dependence under the null hypothesis of no serial dependence, and, secondly the irregular case, where there are nuisance parameters. In this latter case we show how to implement supremum type tests based on the score, likelihood ratio and Wald tests. Chapter 3 is devoted to establishing the asymptotic properties of the various test statistics proposed as well as the standard Box-Pierce-Ljung (BLP) test based on residuals from the generalized linear model fit, this latter being a standard method used by practitioners. To establish the asymptotic properties we first derive the asymptotic distribution of the standard GLM estimators with a proof specifically tailored to the types of time series regressors that we consider throughout the thesis. This result is sufficient for us to establish the asymptotic distribution of the score and the BLP test for the regular case of no nuisance parameters. For the LRT and <b>Wald</b> tests the <b>distribution</b> of the GLARMA and BARMA maximum likelihood estimators are required under the null hypothesis of no serial dependence. This is a new result. For the irregular case, where there are nuisance parameters under the null, we show that the general large sample distribution proposed in the literature for the supremum type tests provides good approximation to this setting. We do not prove the asymptotic result in this case and rely, instead, on simulation evidence. Chapter 4 investigates the finite sample performance of these tests using some small scale simulation studies and application to several data sets is made to demonstrate their effectiveness in practice. For parameter driven models the state equation consists of a regression component and a latent process component which is typically serially dependent. Fitting such models using maximum likelihood requires estimation of a large dimensional integral, or less efficiently in a statistical sense, using composite likelihood methods for example. Such methods are complicated to apply and general purpose software is still not readily available to practitioners. This motivates our focus on simpler methods to first detect the existence of a latent process and second, if one is detected, detect serial dependence in it. In Chapter 5 we have proposed easily implementable two step score-type tests in which the first step detects the existence of a latent process and the second detects the serial dependence. The score test statistic of the first step has nuisance parameters that cannot be estimated under the null hypothesis. This thesis develops and applies supremum type versions of the score tests to detect the presence of the latent process. Its asymptotic distribution, conditional on a fixed nuisance value and unconditional on the nuisance parameter space is presented. The asymptotic distribution of the second step test requires the asymptotic normality of the marginal likelihood estimators, which maximize the likelihood under the assumption that the latent process is generated as an independent sequence. Using marginal likelihood estimation, practitioners can at least obtain the estimates and their standard errors of regression coefficients of parameter driven models without the need to approximate high dimensional integrals. Chapter 6 concentrates on the large sample properties of marginal likelihood estimation. For this method conditions under which the regression parameters β and the latent process variance τ are identifiable are provided. Then the marginal likelihood estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Based on these results, we prove that score test for serial dependence developed under parameter driven models has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis that the latent process is independent. In practice, the marginal likelihood estimation method, when applied to binary data, gives zero estimates of the variance of the latent process with a substantial frequency. When this happens, the marginal likelihood model degenerates to the standard generalized linear model. This thesis provides a useful finite sample approximation for the probability of obtaining τ ̂= 0, where τ is the variance of the latent process. As a consequence of this, we show that under finite samples, the marginal likelihood estimators of regression parameters β has a distribution that is better approximated by a mixture distribution. If serial dependence is detected in the parameter driven model, the marginal likelihood estimation method cannot provide estimate of the serial dependence parameters of the latent process. To obtain the full parameter set of regression parameter β, latent process variance τ and serial dependence coefficients ψ, the composite likelihood estimation is a possible approach. This generalization of marginal likelihood estimation is based on the marginal densities of a joint vector of observations f(y_(t),…y_(t+L)) in the construction of the likelihood. This thesis also implements the composite likelihood estimation method on some real data sets. Chapter 7 investigates how well the asymptotic distributions of the score-type tests and marginal likelihood estimators perform for finite samples via simulation. Application to the same real data sets as used in the part on observation driven models is made to corresponding parameter driven models to compare the tests based on observation driven specification with those based on parameter driven specifications...|$|R
