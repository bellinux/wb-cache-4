25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history.

25|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{not shown}} the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box {{and a dark}} box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E

500|$|During {{the trial}} of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed {{a letter to the}} King {{promising}} his loyalty. [...] "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," [...] the letter read, [...] "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, and I hope it will not be long ere you conquer France." [...] Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: [...] "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a drop of blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2000 BCE is a {{reasonable}} date for the Huastec/Maya split, and {{the slopes of the}} Cuchumatanes range as {{a reasonable}} location for the speakers of proto-Maya, {{it seems likely that the}} split occurred after these proto-Maya speakers (or a portion of them) began to migrate north, probably along the Usumacinta River, and before the two groups resulting from the split began to move in opposite directions: the proto-Huastec speakers moving northwest (and, soon thereafter, the proto-Chicomuceltec west into the Chiapas highlands), and the proto-Yucatec/other Maya-speakers spreading northeast (one branch of which became Chontal, presumed by many from its widespread loan words and hieroglyphic evidence to be the dominant language of the classic Peten Maya heartland) (see Fig. 1). [...] <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no direct archaeological evidence to explain the split itself, we can assume by linguistic evidence that contact was soon cut off between the two groups, despite there being no geographical feature that would automatically isolate them from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} reason for building highways was to motorize Germany. This accorded with the Nazis' self-presentation as modernizers. On February 11, 1933, at the Berlin Motor Show, Hitler had already presented promotion of motoring as an important objective, and named an extensive road-building program as the third on his list of four means of realizing it. Weimar Germany was car-mad, {{and the number of}} private vehicles had increased from 130,346 in 1924 to 489,270 in 1932, but the percentage of car owners lagged behind that in other European countries, not to mention the U.S. This was still true in 1937; at best, most Germans could afford a motorbike, not a car, and the following year the highway commissioner of the State of Michigan observed, [...] "Germany has the roads <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the traffic." [...] Car ownership was a [...] "powerful public desire". Motoring {{and the use of the}} autobahn for outings were heavily promoted. German manufacturers produced touring buses for the non-car-owning public, and the Volkswagen (then called the KdF-Wagen, Strength Through Joy car, for the Nazi recreation organization) was developed and marketed in association with the autobahn to promote car ownership; Hitler first publicly called for its development at the opening of the first Reichsautobahn segment. The war effort put an end to efforts at mass motorization, as savings and production cability for the KdF-Wagen instead went into the Kübelwagen, the military version for all the branches (Wehrmacht Heer, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe) of the combined Wehrmacht armed forces. Mass production of the [...] "Beetle" [...] started only after 1945.|$|E

2500|$|As the Guardians summary shows, {{even after}} the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO {{continued}} to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: [...] "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO {{that they had been}} destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of'." [...] Elkins agreed that it was [...] "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off." [...] Drayton also noted that the FCO [...] "refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled." [...] Drayton further mused that [...] "it was almost as if the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain." ...|$|E
