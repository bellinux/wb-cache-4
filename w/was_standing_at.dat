5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> short leg, forcing him into hospital.

5|$|In 1905 Americus <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> stud in Ireland, but {{spent the}} years 1906 and 1907 in Italy. He {{returned}} to Ireland in 1908 and 1909, but in 1909 was sold and exported to Germany. It is unknown {{what happened to}} him after he went to Germany. At some point before his disappearance in Germany, he also stood at stud in Belgium. Americus died at the Trakehnen Stud in Germany in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Triple H defended the WWE Championship against Umaga. Both men {{performed}} {{a variety of}} wrestling maneuvers, including a DDT from Triple H onto Umaga, and a Samoan drop from Umaga onto Triple H. Umaga attacked Triple H's ribs throughout the match, but Triple H gained an advantage when Umaga missed a hip attack. Umaga attempted to splash Triple H, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the turnbuckle, but Triple H moved and Umaga crashed into the ring post. Triple H then performed a Pedigree for the pinfall, thereby retaining his championship.|$|E

5|$|With leading paceman Ray Lindwall injured, Australia’s bowling {{stocks were}} {{stretched}} and Barnes was brought on during England's second innings {{and as the}} fifth bowler to give the others some time to rest. Barnes delivered five overs and conceded 11 runs. In foggy and misty conditions, Joe Hardstaff junior brought up England's 200 with a firmly-struck hook that almost hit Barnes, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> point-blank range at short leg and could not duck before the ball went past.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton before he was run out. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> short leg. Barnes had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Toshack then bowled Pollard and Young was caught from Johnston's bowling as England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl and the remaining four frontline bowlers sent down at least 38 overs each.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Feast or Fired match next. In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase {{and then leave}} the ring {{in order to gain}} official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of {{establishment}} is disputed, though {{it is clear that}} it <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13thcentury. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe— a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad.|$|E

25|$|Soothsayer was an {{immediate}} success as a breeding stallion. In his first season, he sired Interpreter who won the 2000 Guineas and Filagree, who became an extremely successful broodmare, producing Cobweb (1000Guineas and Oaks Stakes), Charlotte West (Oaks) and Riddlesworth (2000Guineas). His next crop of foals included the Derby winner Tiresias whose victories in 1819 enabled Soothsayer to become that year's Champion sire. By this time he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> Chippenham, near Newmarket at a fee of 25guineas.|$|E

While she <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the bus-stop at approx. 06:44, 25-year-old Håvard Nyfløt pulled up, grabbed her and forced her into the trunk of his car. Ashraf managed to call the police from her cell-phone and inform them that she was being kidnapped, but she could not give her exact location. This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut against Tasmania at the Adelaide Oval in March 1936 in the match where Don Bradman set the Adelaide Oval first-class record of 369.

25|$|A {{few years}} later, Cable got sacked {{from the band}} and {{a few weeks after}} that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> a bus stop and waved back. It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started {{speaking}} again in the Ivy Bush. They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed. The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 1921, {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble. The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to telescope with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversial}} {{instance of}} misconduct occurred during extra {{time in the}} second leg of the two-legged tie, when the overall score <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> 1–1 on aggregate. French player Florent Malouda took a free kick just outside the centre circle in the Irish half of the field. He lofted it toward French captain Thierry Henry, who was making a run in the penalty area to Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's right-hand side. The ball bounced once to Henry, now inside the goal area {{to the left of}} the goal. As it bounced upwards, Henry handled the ball twice with his left hand, stopping it going out of play and bringing the ball under control, before tapping the ball with the outside of his right foot past Given standing at the near goal post. The ball travelled the short distance to William Gallas arriving in the middle of the goal, who headed the ball into the Irish net to confirm France's place at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

500|$|Both Cano and de Fivas {{say that}} whilst {{en route to}} Spinetta Marengo Moustache {{took part in a}} small {{engagement}} between a company of his regiment and some Austrians. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> the front of the company when he received a bayonet wound to his left shoulder. [...] Moustache spent several days recovering in the hospital of the regimental surgeon. [...] Though he was not fully recovered from the wound, still having a limp, Moustache is said to have taken to the field with the regiment on 14 June 1800 at the Battle of Marengo. [...] During the battle he persistently barked at the Austrian forces and was only dissuaded from attacking them by their fixed bayonets.|$|E
500|$|In December 1946, {{after taking}} off during a heavy snowstorm, a Douglas Dakota 3 {{operated}} by Railway Air Services, flying from Northolt to Glasgow, crashed {{onto the roof}} of a house in South Ruislip.

Sources disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the King aside to speak to him, or whether the King moved away toward the audience. Froissart wrote that [...] "The King, who proceeded ahead of , departed from his companions... and went to the ladies to show himself to them... and so passed by the Queen and came near the Duchess of Berry".|$|E
