Due to the coin shortage, the Treasury Department announced that no proof sets would <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> in 1965. Instead, Special Mint Sets would <b>be</b> <b>struck</b> to satisfy collector demand. Coins for these sets, minted at the San Francisco Assay Office, <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> with no mint marks early in 1966 with heavily polished dies dated 1965. Similar sets bearing the dates 1966 and 1967 <b>were</b> also <b>struck.</b> A few of the 1966 halves from the Special Mint Sets are known with Gasparro's initials [...] "FG" [...] missing from the reverse, apparently because of an overpolished die. [...] The first year's production was sold in soft plastic packaging; the 1966 and 1967 issues were sonically sealed in hard plastic cases.
