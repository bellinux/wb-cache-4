5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client,</b> which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the experience of specialization and cooperation thru the perspectives of socialworkers and how it affects their work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients.</b> <b>The</b> last 20 years, specialization has become more common in the municipalities, from 51 % 1989 to 93 % 2007. When a municipality is specialized there is a need for the socialworkers to cooperate. Although <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> tend to not get the service they require, the municipalities becomes more specialized. The study is based on a qualitative method and seven persons are included. The theoretical framework is founded on ideas from newinstitutional organization-theory, human service organizations-theory and the notions collaboration and coordination. The study shows that cooperation is important and discussed in the organizations but it is unclear how cooperation and <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> should be executed. The study also shows that specialization affects <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> both positive and negative. It seems like <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> are referred between different units, but the socialworkers still maintain that they want to work in a specialized organization. Furthermore it seems like the socialworkers both can and can not create a good relation to <b>the</b> <b>client</b> in a specialized organization. <b>The</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> and cooperation seems to be affected by for example the persons in the organization and their time for <b>the</b> work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>clients</b> and cooperation and if they work close to each other or not...|$|R

25|$|A barrister, {{who can be}} {{considered}} as a jurist, is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, this is precisely what enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others as best they can. Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í-inspired Tahirih Justice Center and the Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore in India are {{projects}} that have received particular attention. Layli Miller-Muro founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum {{case in which}} she was involved as a student attorney. Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih.

The Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women was founded in 1985 in India and offers a six-month program for tribal women at its facilities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the Institute; the women came from 119 villages, and after returning home to their cities or villages 45% of them established small businesses, 62% are functionally literate or semi-literate (which has motivated people to send their children to school), 42% have started growing vegetables, 97% are using safe drinking water, all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, and caste prejudices have been eliminated.|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked. Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have a contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> in which he agreed {{to perform the duties}} that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E

2500|$|As explained, REBT is a {{therapeutic}} system of both theory and practices; generally {{one of the}} goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to [...] "un-upset" [...] themselves and then how to empower themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client.</b> The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.|$|E
2500|$|The {{therapist}} plays more of {{a pivotal}} role in the client’s life than mainstream approaches claiming objectivity and value-neutrality would state. Authentically relating to the client implies a much more involved role that the therapist plays in the life of that client. Instead of just being seen as a disengaged, objective observer who spots incongruences between cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes that may lead to unhealthy consequences, the therapist must dialogue deeper <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>client</b> about the subjective truths, values, and meaning that makes up who the client actually is and how he relates to others in the world. Ontological hermeneutics states that this will serve to empower the client, when it is authentic to do so, that it will assist the client's interpretive efforts toward self-understanding. Hermeneuts also state that clients will better understand themselves relationally among others and subsequently participate more meaningfully and authentically in-the-world. [...] Ontological hermeneutics states that these interventions are what relieve human suffering.|$|E
