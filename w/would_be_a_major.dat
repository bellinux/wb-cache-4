5|$|Among {{those who}} met with Jinnah to seek his return was Liaquat Ali Khan, who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{political}} associate of Jinnah {{in the years to}} come and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah. In early 1934, Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London and India on business for the next few years, selling his house in Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski {{to execute}} Samuel Zborowski, whose death {{sentence}} for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as {{the clash between}} the monarch and the nobility, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed {{to the lack of}} support from the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{was part}} of a {{community}} of poets working in Scots and English. These included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), Alexander Ross (1699–1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704–54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712–94), and poet and playwright James Thompson's (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his Seasons. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but {{is best known for his}} picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist.

5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body more representative of society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E
5|$|After the {{religious}} and political upheavals of the seventeenth century, the universities recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that embraced economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to {{the sons of the}} nobility and gentry.

5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E

5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team began {{development}} on Sonic the Hedgehog in 2004, {{after the completion}} of Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003). The team was considering working on an original non-Sonic project, with a realistic look and feel and an advanced physics engine. When they were reassigned to work on the new Sonic game, they decided to retain the realistic approach for the new game. Series co-creator and team lead Yuji Naka envisioned the next-generation Sonic game as a reboot of the franchise, and wanted to mimic the success of superhero films such as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Batman Begins (2005). It was decided to use the same title as the original 1991 game that had launched the franchise to indicate that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> advance from the previous games. The Havok physics engine, previously used in their PlayStation 2 game Astro Boy (2004), allowed them to create expansive levels previously impossible on earlier sixth generation consoles, and experiment with multiple play-styles. Game director Shun Nakamura demonstrated the engine during their stage shows at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe {{turned in a}} similar strong ride at the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took two stage wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, {{in that it was}} a dead flat run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E
30|$|Attention {{has been}} placed on the {{development}} of materials and specialized coatings of pins that could potentially reduce rates of infections. Examples include titanium pins and hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. Titanium is thought to improve the metal–skin interface by inciting a smaller inflammatory response than stainless steel. HA enhances osseointegration of the pin, decreases motion at the interface, and lowers the loosening rate which <b>would,</b> otherwise, <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contributor to infection.|$|R

5|$|The Christianisation of Scotland {{brought the}} country into the {{cultural}} mainstream of Europe.

The Canmore dynasty that would rule Scotland from the eleventh century {{to the end of the}} thirteenth identified itself with Christianity and a strong relationship emerged between the crown and church. The acceptance of papal authority meant that in subsequent centuries the Scottish church faced claims for superior jurisdiction from the archbishoprics of both Canterbury and York and the independent status of Scotland in ecclesiastic matters would only be established by the papal bull of Cum universi in 1192.|$|E
5|$|The Expédition d'Irlande ("Expedition to Ireland") was an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by the}} First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars to assist the outlawed Society of United Irishmen, a popular rebel Irish republican group, in their planned rebellion against British rule.

The French anticipated that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> blow to British morale, prestige and military effectiveness, and was also intended to possibly be the first stage of an eventual invasion of Britain itself. To this end, the French Directory gathered a force of approximately 15,000 soldiers at Brest under General Lazare Hoche during late 1796, in readiness for a major landing at Bantry Bay in December.|$|E
