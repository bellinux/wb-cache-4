25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use continuous {{welded rail}} (CWR), {{sometimes referred to as}} ribbon rails. In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs.

50|$|The {{service has}} {{suffered}} disruption, {{particularly during the}} Troubles, when it was regularly halted by bomb threats. These became so frequent and caused such considerable disruption to the service that a campaigning group, the Peace Train Organisation was formed in 1989. Since the Northern Ireland peace process, however, such disruption has diminished. Renewed investment {{in recent years has}} seen the line upgraded to continuously <b>welded</b> <b>track</b> capable of 145 km/h running along {{the southern part of the}} route, as part of Iarnród Éireann's rail network upgrades. The Northern Ireland section of the line was also upgraded to 90 mph running on many sections of the line.|$|E
40|$|A rail is an {{important}} and the most heavily laden element in the railway superstructure, because it functions as both the running surface used for vehicle guidance and the beam directly transmitting the load of the vehicles to the ballast bed and the railway substructure. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the characteristics of rails and provides a theoretical background relating to rail stresses resulting from traffic load, temperature change and production procedures. When rail vehicles move, enormous contact stresses are produced in the contact zone between the wheel and the rail, which often causes damage to the running surface. Curves with smaller diameters cause particular wear of the rails because of the strongest dynamic effects of the vehicle on the rail. The thesis thus presents the most common surface defects, defines rail wear and outlines currently available techniques of rail grinding and lubrication. In the last few decades, only continuous <b>welded</b> <b>tracks</b> have been consistently installed. To this end, the second chapter describes the procedures and conditions for the construction and welding of rails into continuous <b>welded</b> <b>tracks</b> as provided for in the Rules on railway line superstructure published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 92 / 2010.

50|$|The line’s {{saving grace}} was the {{designation}} of Wirksworth Station Yard as a Strategic Freight Site, which meant that the yard was protected for railway use, thus making closure of the line extremely difficult. The line had already had a ‘Near Death Experience’ in 1990 when a track lifting train began to lift approximately 1 mi of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>track</b> between Idridgehay and Shottle. Fortunately, the work was stopped by British Railways management {{as it was reported}} that there was the possibility of new stone traffic on the line. As a result, the line was mothballed and the strategic freight site designation meant that this status remains on the line to this day.|$|E

The official report was not entirely conclusive as to the causes, but it observed that the annual total of buckling distortions was 48 in 1969, having been in single figures in every previous year, and that heat-related distortions per 1,000 miles per annum were 10.42 for cwr and 2.98 for jointed track in 1969, having been a maximum of 1.78 and 1.21 in the previous ten years. 90% of the distortions {{could be attributed to}} one of the following: ...|$|E

5000|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of the wagons was the problem, but the solution adopted was {{to reduce the}} permitted speed of the wagons to 45 mph, and to reduce the track gauge by one-eighth of an inch, to 4 ft 8⅜in (1432mm) for new installations of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>track</b> on concrete sleepers. Of course the long life cycle of the track meant that this conversion process would take 30 years or more to complete. However, {{the basis of the}} gauge narrowing was mistaken. The idea seems to have been to reduce the free space for lateral movement of the wagons, so that they would be [...] "contained" [...] to run in a straight line. In fact, railway vehicles are not contained by the flanges of the wheels except in very sharp curves, and in normal running the steering effect due to the conicity of the wheels is dominant. In reducing the track gauge, the effective conicity is increased - worsened - and the tendency of the wagons to yaw and roll was increased. Many derailments took place on relatively new continuously welded rail track, and often such a derailment destroyed about a mile of the new track, as the freight train might take that distance to stop; the concrete sleepers were not robust under a derailed wagon's wheels.|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} high speed {{emergency}} braking is discussed for railroad wheels and track.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three main parts: The first part that uses classic track models {{as a basis for}} further developments, the second part that deals with constitutive behaviour of granular materials and the third part that describes {{the development of a new}} triaxial cell apparatus and the testing of a ballast material using this apparatus. The description of classic track models is focused on the beam-on-elastic-foundation model (abbr. BOEF model), which make use of the Winkler foundation, and a simple beam element model with linear discrete support. The shortcomings of the BOEF model is discussed: It assumes a continuous foundation, a continuously <b>welded</b> <b>track,</b> the weight of the track ladder is not incorporated, linear support which imply prediction of tension in the uplift regions, no shear deformation in the rails is taken into account, it cannot predict stresses and strains within the granular layers. While some of the shortcomings may easily be incorporated others are not: Especially to remove tension in the uplift zones, and to calculate stresses and strains in the granular layers. The latter actually requires a continuum approach. A track model that approximately eliminates the tension in the uplift regions has been developed for a single axle load. As expected, the model shows that the length of the uplift zone and the amount of uplift have higher values than predicted by the BOEF model. The model may be useful when considering contact problems in the track, for instance in a buckling-of-rails analysis. For the BOEF model a tool that makes use of dimensionless sensitivity diagrams has been developed. The method will in an easy way provide the new maximum track reactions when one or more track parameters are changed. It is hoped that this tool will prove very helpful in a design process, at least as a first step. Dimensionless sensitivity diagrams have been worked out for rail deflection, rail moment, rail seat load, tensional rail base stress and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast. The parameters considered are the design wheel load, rail moment of inertia, position of neutral axis in the rail, sleeper spacing, sleeper width and the length of the sleeper that carries the vertical load. The dimensionless sensitivity diagrams for the BOEF model may be used both for a single axle load and for a double axle load. Also for a beam element model with linear discrete support the dimensionless sensitivity diagrams may be used, but only for a single axle load which is located directly above one of the supports, i. e. a sleeper. For the beam element model the diagrams for the rail deflection, rail seat load and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast are almost identical to the ones for the BOEF model, while the diagrams for the rail moment and tensile rail base stress are somewhat different. A beam element model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements resting on nonlinear discrete supports was developed for a single axle load. The discrete supports, which were located at the sleeper positions, were modelled by a two-parameter power function. The model takes advantage of a measured load-deflection relationship, which is also modelled by a two-parameter power function. These latter parameters are generally found by regression of the measured data, while the two parameters for the discrete supports are found as part of the overall solution to the problem. The present version of the model only takes into account a short track section and further development of the model is therefore needed. The track ladder weight and a no tension option in the uplift region are not incorporated in the present version. The model is useful when the BOEF model cannot be used because of nonlinear track response. Regarding constitutive behaviour it is argued that the plastic strain per load cycle in a well functioning railway track must be very small and normally below 1 / 100 000 of the elastic strain per load cycle. If also the hysteresis of the material during a load cycle is small, then an elastic approximation could be justified when it comes to calculating the stresses. The plastic strains may then be detached from the stress-strain calculation and modelled separately on the basis of laboratory or field measurements. Several elastic constitutive models are described: The Hooke's law generalised to three dimensions, the cross anisotropic elastic model, two versions of the k-model, and two hyperelastic models. The general elasto-plastic framework with isotropic hardening is also described. The basics of repeated loading of a frictional system is described by analogy to a simple model with springs and frictional sliders. This model can be viewed as the basis for the pure kinematic multisurface model by Mróz and Iwan. Through energy considerations in cyclic loading of the frictional system the concept of reclaimed plastic strain is rejected. The concept of initial stresses and strains is discussed. It is argued that initial stresses cannot be large in the upper part of a road or railway embankment. The main reason for this is that granular materials cannot self equilibrate stresses through tension. The development and construction of triaxial equipment for testing railway ballast in its original grading is described. The specimens are 300 mm by 600 mm (diameter by height). A new and direct way of applying the confining load was developed, which allowed faster variation of the confining stress. A new instrumentation concept was invented where instrumentation rings are fastened to material particles instead of being attached to the outer membrane or to plugs embedded in the material. This arrangement measures the horizontal deformation. The vertical deformation has to be measured over the whole specimen length as resilient particle rotations prevented on-sample instrumentation. A test series on Vassfjell railway ballast was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the new apparatus and to characterise the ballast material. The overall performance of the apparatus was found to be good with a reliable repeatability, but some modifications were suggested to improve the loading procedure in the beginning of the load steps. The test series on Vassfjell ballast was rather limited and no advanced modelling of the results was found to be appropriate. Instead an isotropic linear elastic approach was followed. Moisture was added, to the natural retention capacity, to some of the specimens. It was found that the added moisture only slightly affected the mechanical behaviour of the material. A somewhat denser grading was also tested, but the observed effect on the material properties was limited. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} of measuring the surface topography of metallic surfaces produced by additive manufacturing are investigated. The differences between measurements made using various optical and non-optical technologies, including confocal and focus-variation microscopy, coherence scanning interferometry and x-ray computed tomography, are examined. As opposed to concentrating on differences which may arise through computing surface texture parameters from measured topography datasets, a comparative analysis is performed focussing on {{investigation of the}} quality of the topographic reconstruction of a series of surface features. The investigation is carried out by considering the typical surface features of a metal powder-bed fusion process: <b>weld</b> <b>tracks,</b> <b>weld</b> ripples, attached particles and surface recesses. Results show that no single measurement technology provides a completely reliable rendition of the topographic features that characterise the metal powder-bed fusion process. However, through analysis of measurement discrepancies, light can be shed on where instruments are more susceptible to error, and why differences between measurements occur. The results presented in this work increase the understanding of the behaviour and performance of areal topography measurement, and thus promote the development of improved surface characterisation pipelines...|$|R
