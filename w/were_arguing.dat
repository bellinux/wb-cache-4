The idea of a London mayor of a Greater London Authority had been included in Labour's 1997 election manifesto, and after their election a referendum was scheduled for May 1998, in which there was a 72% yes vote with a 34% turnout. With the first mayoral election scheduled for May 2000, in March 1998 Livingstone stated his intention to stand as a potential Labour candidate for the position.|$|E
5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament {{had no right to}} levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute {{was part of a larger}} divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In the colonies, however, the idea {{had developed}} that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson <b>were</b> <b>arguing</b> that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was {{established}} in 1988 in the United States by {{the passing of the}} National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims of vaccine injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they <b>were</b> <b>arguing</b> that Michelle developed autism {{as a result of the}} combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.|$|E

She is not pregnant, but ends their relationship, believing that they want {{different}} things. However, they soon reconcile. Max is framed for causing a car crash that leaves Phil hospitalised. Abi and Lauren, who returns from rehabilitation, struggle to pay Max's legal costs, {{as well as their}} bills. Abi receives her exam results and discovers she has not gained the grades to go to university to become a vet, but Lauren, believing that Abi has passed the exams, throws a party, during which Abi blurts out that she blames Lauren for her poor results because she has an alcohol problem. Abi decides to continue studying, but when Max goes to prison for a while she has to take a job, and struggles to find time for her studies. However, Max is proven innocent, and returns home to support his family. In an argument between Jay and Dexter, Abi discovers that on their holiday Jay kissed a barmaid while they <b>were</b> <b>arguing</b> over the suspected pregnancy. She also finds out that Lola knew and furiously confronts her best friend. However, after a heart-to-heart with Jay, they decide to work through their issues and she fixes things with Dexter and Lola as well. She also takes in a stray dog, Tramp.|$|E

Inspired by Lave and Wenger’s (1991) approach to situated learning the heterogeneous aspect of practice is highlighted and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that we analytically need to distinguish between learning to master specific elements in various communities of practice and to orient oneself in a multiple-contextual practice.

25|$|Pompey and Crassus {{conducted}} the levy for their campaigns in their provinces. This created discontent. Some of the plebeian tribunes instituted {{a suit against}} their lieutenants that was actually aimed at them. They then tried to annul levies and rescind the vote for the proposed campaigns. Pompey was not perturbed because had already sent his lieutenants to Hispania. He had intended to let them deal with Hispania while he would gladly stay in Rome with the pretext {{that he had to}} stay there because he was the praefectus annonae. Crassus, instead needed his levy for his campaign against Parthia. He considered using force. The unarmed plebeian tribunes avoided confrontation, but they did criticise him. While Crassus was offering the prayers, which were customary before war, they claimed bad omens. One of the tribunes tried to have Crassus arrested. However, the others objected and while they <b>were</b> <b>arguing</b> Crassus left the city. He then headed for Syria and invaded Parthia. Plutarch thought that Crassus, the richest man in Rome, felt inferior to Pompey and Caesar only in military achievement and added a passion for glory to his greed. His achievements in the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC) and in the Third Servile War (71 BC) were now a fading memory. Plutarch also wrote that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul. He approved of his intentions and spurred him to war.|$|E

40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> an “externalist” in {{at least}} one sense. For it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that {{genuinely}} perceptual experiences—that is to say, experiences that are of some real object in the world—differ intrinsically, essentially and as a kind from any hallucinatory experiences. There is, therefore, no neutral “content” that such perceptual experiences share with hallucinations, differing from them only over whether some additional non-psychological condition holds or not. In short, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> a “disjunctivist”. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that the individual object of any experience, perceptual or hallucinatory, is essential to and partly constitutive of that experience.

Saturday Night Live alumna Nancy Walls, who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife. At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer.

Gomułka insisted that he be given real power to implement reforms. One specific condition he set was that Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, who had mobilized troops against the Poznań workers, be removed from the Polish Politburo and Defense Ministry, to which Ochab agreed. The majority of the Polish leadership, backed by both the army and the Internal Security Corps, brought Gomułka and several associates into the Politburo and designated Gomułka as First Secretary. Untouched by the scandals of Stalinism, Gomułka was acceptable to the Polish masses, but at first was viewed with much suspicion by Moscow.|$|E
