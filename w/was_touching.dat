He had created the first gas-discharge lamp.|$|E
25|$|To {{all those}} engrossed in the close-quarter melee it was {{something}} of a surprise to find that when all the players climbed back to their feet Campese was not {{at the bottom of the}} pile, winded and wounded. In fact, Campese <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> down for a try. As Ryan loomed, Campese had stolen in, stolen away the ball and simply sprinted off in glorious isolation down the left hand touchline while the England B attack continued without the ball.|$|E
25|$|Russolo built these {{instruments}} {{to perform the}} music outlined in his Art of Noises manifesto. The instruments were completely acoustic, not electronic. The boxes had various types of internal construction to create different types of noise. Often a wheel <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> a string attached to a drum. The wheel rattled or bowed the strings, while the drum functioned as an acoustic resonator. Many of the instruments featured a handle {{on top of the}} box, which was used to vary the string tension. Pulling the handle raised the tone, and the horn attached to the box amplified the sound. Intonarumori ('noise makers' in Italian) made noise, but not at a very loud volume, since they were all acoustic devices.|$|E

25|$|Frequency {{of touch}} also varies {{significantly}} between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, {{one of which}} examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> more frequently than normal {{it would be necessary}} to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a kiss on the cheek is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, Eugene Onegin is a bored Saint Petersburg dandy, {{whose life}} {{consists}} of balls, concerts, parties and nothing more. One day he inherits a landed estate from his uncle. When {{he moves to}} the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fianc√©e, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech {{is often referred to as}} Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter <b>was</b> <b>touching,</b> but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new ways to use his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured pane of glass. The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an air pocket around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> the same surface that they were standing on.|$|E
40|$|In our research, {{we aim to}} {{construct}} the visual-haptic system which generate haptic feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> {{on the surface of}} various virtual objects, even though they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> only a static shape. We focus on the cross modal effect between our vision and haptic sense, which is generally called Pseudo-Haptics, and make up a illusionary haptics only using visual feedback, without any complicated physical devices. In our system, user touches the physical object behind the LCD, and sees the virtual object through the LCD using video see-through methodology. We put two web cameras to provide the different image for each eye and maintain the optical conjugation between viewpoint and cameras using the mirror {{in the back of the}} LCD. From images captured by these cameras, we compose visual feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> another virtual shape, based on the detection of the point where they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> the physical object. This makes up a haptic illusion as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> the virtual shape. By our proposed system, users perceive visual and haptic sensation as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> various virtual shapes, without any complicated physical devices...|$|R

500|$|... "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, and that it <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The {{rest of the story}} lines from last night just kind of sat there rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just seemed so dumpy for this once-sexy show".|$|E
500|$|Tyrone {{reached their}} second All-Ireland Final in 1995, and were up against Dublin who hadn't won a Championship since the 1980s. In a turgid match, Canavan scored eleven of Tyrone's twelve points in the, but still {{ended up on}} the losing side. The game was remembered as {{contentious}} for Tyrone fans, for the fact that a point that would have equalised the match in the dying seconds was controversially disallowed, because the blind-sided referee deemed Canavan to have touched the ball on the ground. The referee, Paddy Russell stated in his autobiography that he was certain the ball was on the ground, but Canavan contested in the same book that he managed to get elevation on the ball as he punched, which would have been very difficult to do if it <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> the ground.|$|E

500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning.

500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers.

He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong‚Äîor cohesive‚Äîas last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it just might be the best show on TV." ...|$|E

During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It <b>was</b> <b>touching.</b> I tipped my hat, but they just kept going.

To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again."

The doctor who treated her said that the problem {{was so bad that}} he would examine her feet and ask which toe of which foot he <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> and she told him that she couldn't feel anything. The doctor said that the problem was that, since she couldn't feel her feet, her brain wasn't able to process where they were, leading to the [...] "clipping" [...] in the medal race in Beijing.

2500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{television}} show Family was born in Aaron Spelling's kitchen, where he and Leonard Goldberg {{came up with the}} idea about a show that centered on the emotional life of a family. They pitched the idea to Allen and she liked it. Allen spent two weeks at the Beverly Hills Hotel while she knocked out a script. Len and Aaron loved it; it <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> and had marvelous moments of compassion, and was exactly what they had talked about in the kitchen. The pilot was great, but ABC didn't buy it. It wasn't until two years later that ABC entered a production deal with Mike Nichols, who turned down all their ideas in favor of the script for Family that his Connecticut neighbor Jay Allen had shown him. It was Nichols who brought in Mark Rydell for the pilot which premiered at 10:00pm on March 9, 1976; the series went on to run for four years and 86 episodes. Later in life Allen would remark about television: [...] "I hate it, I hate it because the buck doesn't stop anywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon‚ÄìBeverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover.
