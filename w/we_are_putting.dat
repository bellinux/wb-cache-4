500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of you to think is that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3D {{cameras were}} unable to pick up {{anything}} shiny, such as stainless steel, due to a flare. Set decorator Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are [...] "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, [...] "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light. [...] So we had to add more and more black. [...] The reason I say it's too light is because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> more light onto these sets than we ever have before." ...|$|E
500|$|Gavin {{said that}} “the show <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> on is very shiny, it's very colourful. We don't want to bang on about our culture. We {{just want to}} have fun.” [...] Es Devlin added that it [...] "has to make sense in Bognor and Bogotá." [...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music". In the handover section Rio aimed to express [...] "multicultural embrace." [...] Daniela Thomas stated that Rio [...] "want to show you how sophisticated we mix things, what we do with the things you believe we are, how we mix with pop culture." ...|$|E

500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said to me <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} criticised by {{psychologist}} Glenn Wilson, who {{referred to it}} as a [...] "freak show". He stated that [...] " [...] deficiencies and shortcomings are as important as their talent. We enjoy the stress <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> these people under – will they or will they not survive?" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on {{his opposition}} to the program: [...] "I think we are removing much of the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and employment objectives, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> that onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it rest where it should lie. We are too accepting of dangerous policies from others that have been long in the making, and we should put the burden on them." [...] While Federal Reserve officials routinely offer their views on non-monetary questions such as taxes, spending and regulations, it is unusual for a Federal Reserve official to suggest that monetary support should be withheld in order to compel other branches of government to enact the Federal Reserve's favored policies.|$|E

6000|$|Lest {{it should}} be {{supposed}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> flippant expressions {{into the mouth of}} Rainiharo, we may explain that the Malagasy define an ungrateful man as the [...] "son of a thunderbolt," [...] and sometimes as the [...] "offspring of a wild-boar," [...] because--so they say--the young of the wild-boar, when running by the side of its dam, continually gets in advance and turns round to bite her. The ingratitude of which our friend Ravonino was supposed to be guilty, consisted in his having forsaken the idols of the country and renounced the favour of the Queen by becoming a Christian, preferring, like Moses, to suffer affliction with the banished people of God.|$|E

But he is an animal that evidently knows his own mind, and fortunately both are in the house. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> him up for to-night with the cow, who greeted him at first with enthusiasm and wanted to adopt him, but has grown cold to him since on discovering that he is not a calf.

She doesn't seem to want to be happy ever again.|$|E
6000|$|... “One {{must also}} {{remember}} that {{a large percentage of}} them are younger brothers; instead of going into bankruptcy, which is the usual tendency of the younger brother nowadays, they gave their families a fair chance of going into mourning. Every bullet finds a billet, according to a rather optimistic proverb, and you must admit that nowadays it is becoming increasingly difficult to find billets for a lot of young gentlemen who would have adorned, and probably thoroughly enjoyed, one of the old-time happy-go-lucky wars. But that is not exactly the burden of my complaint. The Balkan lands are especially interesting to us in these rapidly-moving days because they afford us the last remaining glimpse of a vanishing period of European history. When I was a child one of the earliest events of the outside world that forced itself coherently under my notice was a war in the Balkans; I remember a sunburnt, soldierly man putting little pin-flags in a war-map, red flags for the Turkish forces and yellow flags for the Russians. It seemed a magical region, with its mountain passes and frozen rivers and grim battlefields, its drifting snows, and prowling wolves; there was a great stretch of water that bore the sinister but engaging name of the Black Sea—nothing that I ever learned before or after in a geography lesson made the same impression on me as that strange-named inland sea, and I don’t think its magic has ever faded out of my imagination. And there was a battle called Plevna that went on and on with varying fortunes for what seemed like a great part of a lifetime; I remember the day of wrath and mourning when the little red flag had to be taken away from Plevna—like other maturer judges, I was backing the wrong horse, at any rate the losing horse. And now to-day <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> little pin-flags again into maps of the Balkan region, and the passions are being turned loose once more in their playground.” ...|$|E

And <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>put</b> (I believe) into the next world for the very same purpose--to do God's will; and if we do that, we shall find pleasure enough in doing it. I do not doubt that in the next world all manner of harmless pleasure will come to us likewise; because that will <b>be,</b> <b>we</b> hope, a perfect and a just world, not a piecemeal, confused, often unjust world, like this: but pleasant things will come to us in the next life, only in proportion as <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> doing God's will in the next life; and <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> happy and blessed, only because <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> living that eternal life of which I have been preaching to you all along, the life which Christ lives and has lived and will live for ever, saying to the Eternal Father--I come to do thy will--not my will but thine be done.|$|R
6000|$|I {{find myself}} in {{agreement}} with Mr. Robert Lynd for his most just remark {{in connection with the}} Malatesta case, that the police are becoming a peril to society. I have no attraction to that sort of atheist asceticism to which the purer types of Anarchism tend; but both an atheist and an ascetic are better men than a spy; and it is ignominious to see one's country thus losing her special point of honour about asylum and liberty. It will be quite a new departure if we begin to protect and whitewash foreign policemen. I always understood it was only English policemen who were absolutely spotless. A good many of us, however, have begun to feel with Mr. Lynd, and on all sides authorities and officials are being questioned. But there is one most graphic and extraordinary fact, which it did not lie in Mr. Lynd's way to touch upon, but which somebody really must seize and emphasise. It is this: that at the very time when we are all beginning to doubt these authorities, we are letting laws pass to increase their most capricious powers. All our commissions, petitions, and letters to the papers are asking whether these authorities can give an account of their stewardship. And at the same moment all our laws are decreeing that they shall not give any account of their stewardship, but shall become yet more irresponsible stewards. Bills like the Feeble-Minded Bill and the Inebriate Bill (very appropriate names for them) actually arm with scorpions the hand that has chastised the Malatestas and Maleckas with whips. The inspector, the doctor, the police sergeant, the well-paid person who writes certificates and [...] "passes" [...] this, that, or the other; this sort of man is being trusted with more authority, apparently because he is being doubted with more reason. In one room we are asking why the Government and the great experts between them cannot sail a ship. In another room we are deciding that the Government and experts shall be allowed, without trial or discussion, to immure any one's body, damn any one's soul, and dispose of unborn generations with the levity of a pagan god. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> the official on the throne while he is still in the dock.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{offered me a}} chair, and then lingered a moment, as if she felt some {{disposition}} to entertain me if she could only {{think of something to}} say; and at last, looking up in my face, she said, in a confidential tone, [...] "Mother says she left Willie and me to keep house this afternoon while she was gone, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> up all the things for Sunday, so as to get every thing done before she comes home. Willie has gone to put away the playthings, and I'm going to put up the books." [...] So saying, she opened the doors of one of the bookcases, and began busily carrying the books from the centre table to deposit them on the shelves, in which employment she was soon assisted by Willie, who took the matter in hand in a very masterly manner, showing his sister what were and what were not [...] "Sunday books" [...] with the air of a person entirely at home in the business. Robinson Crusoe and the many-volumed Peter Parley were put by without hesitation; there was, however, a short demurring over a North American Review, because Willie said he was sure his father read something one Sunday out of one of them, while Susan averred that he did not commonly read in it, and only read in it then because the piece was something about the Bible; but as nothing could be settled definitively on the point, the review was [...] "laid on the table," [...] like knotty questions in Congress. Then followed a long discussion over an extract book, which, as usual, contained all sorts, both sacred, serious, comic, and profane; and at last Willie, with much gravity, decided to lock it up, on the principle that it was best {{to be on the safe}} side, in support of which he appealed to me. I was saved from deciding the question by the entrance of the father and mother. My old friend knew me at once, and presented his pretty wife to me with the same look of exultation with which he used to hold up a string of trout or an uncommonly fine perch of his own catching for my admiration, and then looking round on his fine family of children, two more of which he had brought home with him, seemed to say to me, [...] "There! what do you think of that, now?" ...|$|E
60|$|And yet, {{when one}} comes to think upon it calmly, the {{situation}} of these South American citizens forms only a very pale figure {{for the state of}} ordinary mankind. This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in over-crowded space, among a million other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well come by a knock that would set it into explosion like a penny squib. And what, pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful of petards? The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's powder- magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal we eat, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> one or more of them in peril. If we clung as devotedly as some philosophers pretend we do to the abstract idea of life, or were half as frightened as they make out we are, for the subversive accident that ends it all, the trumpets might sound by the hour and no one would follow them into battle - the blue-peter might fly at the truck, but who would climb into a sea-going ship? Think (if these philosophers were right) with what a preparation of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner-table: a deadlier spot than any battle-field in history, where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have miserably left their bones! What woman would ever be lured into marriage, so much more dangerous than the wildest sea? And what would it be to grow old? For, after a certain distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our feet, and all around us and behind us we see our contemporaries going through. By the time a man gets well into the seventies, his continued existence is a mere miracle, and when he lays his old bones in bed for the night, there is an overwhelming probability that he will never see the day. Do the old men mind it, as a matter of fact? Why, no. They were never merrier; they have their grog at night, and tell the raciest stories; they hear of the death of people about their own age, or even younger, not {{as if it was a}} grisly warning, but with a simple childlike pleasure at having outlived some one else; and when a draught might puff them out like a guttering candle, or a bit of a stumble shatter them like so much glass, their old hearts keep sound and unaffrighted, and they go on, bubbling with laughter, through years of man's age compared to which the valley at Balaklava was as safe and peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday. It may fairly be questioned (if we look to the peril only) whether it was a much more daring feat for Curtius to plunge into the gulf, than for any old gentleman of ninety to doff his clothes and clamber into bed.|$|E
