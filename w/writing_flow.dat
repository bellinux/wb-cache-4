40|$|Graphical user {{interface}} guidelines {{have been developed}} predominantly in English-speaking countries, but aspects related to culture (e. g., local metaphors, symbols, color, and flow) are not universal and have received little or no attention. Even though the reading and <b>writing</b> <b>flow</b> of languages such as English, Japanese, and Chinese differ widely, most software interfaces do not take account of this. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of menu flow or menu orientation in both the Chinese and English languages for Chinese users. The experimental results indicate that for the Chinese population, a horizontal menu in either language {{is more effective than}} the vertical orientation. Thus item differentiation in menus is best performed when the natural flow of the user's native language is broken through a transformation process similar to a matrix transpose. Even though we did not investigate search strategies explicitly, we hypothesize that the primary reason for the difference lies in the scanning patterns adopted by the Chinese population in search tasks so that there is no mismatch in the reading metaphors. Applications of this research include the design of culturally and linguistically adapted human-computer interfaces for Chinese users...|$|E

40|$|In this era, English is {{established}} {{as the world}} language of research and publication. This makes the English language significant for students and professionals. Tangkiengsirisin (2010, 1) states that text flow through a sequence of sentences is a main criterion for advanced writing. This research is aimed at finding out the flows of ideas of the English Arguments of Indonesian writers. This research applies topical, paradigmatic analysis. It involves identifying topics and sequences of topics/ ideas. After the topical analysis is done, the investigator contemplates the ideas development pattern of the entire essay. After analyzing fourteen English Arguments of Indonesian writers, it is found out that English Arguments of Indonesian writers are mostly developed linearly. It contradicts with Kaplan’s explanation (1966) that oriental groups express their ideas mostly in indirect ways. It means that at present Kaplan’s theory is partly valid. Even though the English Arguments of Indonesian writers are mostly developed linearly, it doesn’t mean that the teachers can ignore it in teaching Advanced <b>Writing.</b> <b>Flow</b> of ideas should {{become one of the}} materials of Advanced Writing to Indonesian learners, but it doesn’t need more teaching time allotment.

40|$|A central goal of {{literacy}} instruction {{is to promote}} involvement in reading and writing. Recently, some investigators have reported how classroom instruction influences intrinsic motivation for literacy (Guthrie 2 ̆ 6 Wigfield, 1997; Morrow, Sharkey, 2 ̆ 6 Firestone, 1993; Oldfather, 1993 a; Turner, 1995; Turner 2 ̆ 6 Paris, 1995), but others are beginning to explore how students represent motivating literacy experiences (Oldfather, 1993 b; Sweet 2 ̆ 6 Guthrie, 1996).

The language {{has a long history}} of <b>writing</b> <b>flowing</b> out of the literary and religious culture nurtured by the Lan Na Kingdom from the 13 th Century onwards. Comparison of phoneme and grapheme inventories shows that the orthography is well able to represent the spoken language as well as ancient Pali religious texts. Apart from spelling conventions reflecting the etymology of borrowed Pali and Sanskrit morphemes, sound changes over time have also decreased the phonological transparency of the orthography, notwithstanding the need of some more conservative varieties which still preserve distinctions lost in other varieties. Despite the complexities of the script, the literacy rates in Khuen are remarkably high for a minority language not taught in the government school system...|$|R
