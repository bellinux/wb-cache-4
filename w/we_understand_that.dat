Good fun may be expected, {{as some of the}} players are reputed to be {{exceedingly}} expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.|$|E
25|$|In {{those days}} the kings were warlords rather than kings as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> title today, {{and what was}} to become Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a modern sense, were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed {{constantly}} as the kings killed each other, and had the local assemblies accept them as kings. The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in Beowulf (see e.g. the semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars) and the Norse sagas.|$|E
25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. <b>We</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E

In 2000, Nayyouf was recognized by the International Press Institute as a World Press Freedom Hero. Nayyouf received the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize in 2001, while he was still jailed and in very poor health.

Hacikyan said that the band initially wanted to [...] "pull away" [...] from the songs, but [...] "at the same time, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> most people haven’t heard them yet." [...] While preparing a mix, Squire would typically [...] "trigger" [...] the drums, a technique he uses to give the drums a thicker sound. However, the group was against the idea. Squire found it a [...] "fun challenge" [...] making the drums [...] "sound punchy without them." [...] Squire spent a few days doing a mixing draft of the album, with assistance from Paul Leavitt. Then he asked for feedback from both the label and the group. After incorporating the feedback, he finalized the mixes, and sent the album for mastering. Ue Nastasi mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound.|$|E
500|$|Tropic Thunder {{was criticized}} by the {{disability}} advocacy community. The website for Simple Jack was withdrawn on August 4 amid several groups' concerns over its portrayal of mental retardation. A spokesman for DreamWorks said, [...] "We heard their concerns, and <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> taken out of context, the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities." [...] A coalition of more than 20disability advocacy groups, including the Special Olympics and the Arc of the United States, objected to the film's repeated and excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "retard". DreamWorks offered to screen the film for the groups on August 8 to determine if it still offended them. The screening was postponed to the same day of the premiere on August 11. After representatives for the groups attended the private screening and were offended by its content, the groups picketed outside the film's premiere. Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics, stated, [...] "This population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against Hollywood. We're sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable." ...|$|E

In {{a statement to the}} Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals {{to be included in the}} paid service [...] "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms." [...] Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that [...] "while we wish that we had [...] 100% success rate, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience." [...] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service. However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal.|$|E
