The authors describe a traditional CAD/CAM approach to motion planning (as used in machine tool operation) which has numerous benefits including the provision for detailed structural layout to be built into the path planning, and the subsequent visual overlay of measurement data back into the CAD model. Initial trials using a steel plate with varying thickness defects have been investigated. A custom robot incorporating an ultrasonic <b>wheel</b> <b>probe</b> as rear wheel {{has been used to}} perform an ultrasonic thickness scan of the sample Ð the results have been compared to those obtained using a high resolution <b>wheel</b> <b>probe</b> scan of the sample. The robot control was generated from an initial CAD model of the sample, and the integration of post&# 8208,processor output (in this case G code), was used as the input for our custom robotic control software to generate both simulation and experimental motion control of our robotic platform...|$|E

If such devices are to become general purpose NDE tools then {{it is important that the}} parameters which limit their use be understood. Experience gained at Imperial College by using such devices on real engineering structures indicated that the presence of high surface roughness and dust/dirt severely affected their performance. It is the aim of this paper to quantify these effects and gain a better understanding of their origins. This increased understanding will then allow for improved design of dry coupled devices...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic Non Destructive Testing (NDT) is used {{to inspect}} {{materials}} and structures for defects. Water is commonly used in NDT as a couplant to improve ultrasonic transfer between an interrogating probe and test piece. Unfortunately, the presence of water can cause corrosion and/or degradation of the test piece material. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate hydrated cross-linked hydrophilic polymers as candidate solid contact ultrasonic couplant for use in the field of ultrasonic NDT. The fact that hydrophilic polymers can absorb and retain large quantities of water suggested that they might demonstrate the desirable ultrasonic properties of water without the risks associated with conventional water coupling. To test this, the ultrasonic properties of a range of hydrophilic polymers were assessed. Excellent results were achieved, attenuation as low as 0. 36 and 0. 71 dB mm- 1 at 5 and 1 OMHz respectively being measured. Great potential for efficient coupling was established due to acoustic impedance in the region of 1. 81 VIN S M- 3. A polymer dependant coupling pressure of less that 1 kg CM- 2 was required to achieve optimum coupling to a smooth steel block. Mechanical longevity, evaluated by life testing, showed that polymers of up to 70 % equilibrium water content were best suited for dynamic testing applications. Temperature was shown to effect ultrasonic properties; a drop from 5 to - 120 C caused an increase in attenuation of 3 dB mm- 1 and velocity of 350 m s- 1. Pressure demonstrated no influence on attenuation but affected an increase in velocity of 44 m s- 1 per kg CM- 2. Further investigation into the unique ultrasonic properties of hydrophilic polymers showed that the water sorption process caused an increase in attenuation prior to saturation being reached. This was attributed to the absorption of sound during the polymer transformation from the glassy to rubbery condition observed during hydration. Dehydration from 100 to 37 % saturation in a 60 % equilibrium water content polymer caused an increase in attenuation of 1. 8 dB mm- 1 at 5 MHz. The research concluded with the design and development of a prototype <b>wheel</b> <b>probe</b> employing hydrophilic polymer as the tyre. Operation at 5 MHz in pulse echo mode demonstrated results competitive to conventional immersion testing. An MMA-VP cross-linked hydrophilic polymer of approximately 60 % equilibrium water content was found most suitable to this application. This thesis suggests that there is a clear role for hydrophilic polymers in ultrasonic NDT. The success of the <b>wheel</b> <b>probe</b> design developed {{as a result of this}} research has resulted in patent application in both the UK and USA...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of modern robotic manipulators has allowed research in recent years, {{for the development}} of fast automated non-destructive testing (NDT) of complex geometries. Contemporary robots are well suited for their accuracy and flexibility when adapting to new tasks. Several robotic inspection prototype systems and a number of commercial products have been created around the world. This paper describes the latest progress of a new phase of the research applied to a composite aerospace component of size 1 by 3 metres. A multi robot flexible inspection cell was used to take the fundamental research and the feasibility studies to higher technology readiness levels, all set for future industrial exploitation. The robot cell was equipped with high accuracy and high payload robots, mounted on 7 metre tracks, and an external rotary axis. A robotically delivered photogrammetry technique was first used to assess the position of the components placed within the robot working envelope and their deviation to CAD. Offline programming was used to generate a scan path for phased array ultrasonics testing (PAUT) which was implemented using high data rate acquisition from a conformable <b>wheel</b> <b>probe.</b> Real-time robot path-correction, based on force-torque control (FTC), was deployed to achieve the optimum ultrasonic coupling and repeatable data quality. New communication software was developed that enabled the simultaneous control of the multiple robots performing different tasks and the reception of accurate positional feedback positions. All aspects of the system were controlled through a purposely developed graphic user interface that enabled the flexible use of the unique set of hardware resources, the data acquisition, visualisation and analysis. This work was developed through the VIEWS project (Validation and Integration of Manufacturing Enablers for Future Wing Structures), part funded by the UK’s innovation agency (Innovate UK) ...|$|E
40|$|The Integrity GNSS Receiver (IGNSSRX) is a European Commission funded {{project with}} three main objectives: The {{development}} of two platforms {{to capture and}} store GNSS radio frequency signal samples and a reference trajectory from representative low-, medium- And high-end sensors in terrestrial applications. An extensive data collection campaign aiming to characterize error sources, magnitudes and probabilities for two important GNSS terrestrial application areas: Automotive and pedestrian users. The {{research and development of}} techniques and algorithms to mitigate the integrity threats in the two terrestrial environments studied using the collected data, thus allowing reliable terrestrial applications within these domains. This paper presents the results for the first two objectives of the IGNSSRX project, providing the GNSS measurement error characterization results obtained from the analysis of the real data collected using the developed platforms during the acquisition campaign, together with a preliminary report on the developed techniques and algorithms. Data Collection Platforms Two Data Acquisition and Storage Units (DASU) have been developed within the IGNSSRX project for the data collection campaign in the vehicular and pedestrian domains: Vehicular DASU: RF Front-Ends: A high resolution FE and a three- Antenna FE system working both in the GPS LI and Galileo El bands and the GLONASS LI band. The high-resolution FE allows the application of DSP techniques to detect the integrity threat and the three antenna array allows the use of the direction of arrival (DOA) information to identify non line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Record raw data from medium and low cost COTS sensors, such as IMUs and odometer, for PVT hybridisation with GNSS as well as to provide a reference of the performance or representative medium and low cost solutions used in these applications Truth reference equipment using a high accuracy/high availability reference system based on high geodetic-grade GPS&GLONASS dual-frequency receiver, tactical-grade IMU and digital <b>wheel</b> <b>probe,</b> processed using a dedicated COTS post-processing software. Common atomic clock (CSAC Caesium clock) synchronizing the platform with the truth reference equipment. Pedestrian DASU: RF Front-Ends: A high resolution FE in the GPS LI and GLONASS LI bands. Records GSM and Wi-Fi measurements to augment/hybridise with GNSS and mobile phone platform as a COTS reference Truth reference equipment based on a GPS&GLONASS L 1 /L 2 geodetic receiver plus route trace. Common atomic clock (CSAC Caesium clock) synchronizing the platform with the truth reference equipment. Data Collection Campaigns Using the two DASU an extensive data collection campaign has been carried out covering representative road and pedestrian user environments: Vehicular campaign: fourteen days of road data collection covering a motorway route with open sky (best case), and an urban route through typical city environments with canyons and tunnels. Pedestrian campaign: A number of different routes around city areas in three cities. Of these routes there are two "city centre" routes, where there is a mixture of closely spaced buildings, covered arcades and wider roads; two in "out of town" shopping centres with large car parks for initialisation and limited visibility in the remaining of the route; and a rural/suburban route around a park area. Interference campaign: The collected data is complemented by tests performed with a signal simulator to test the impact of interferences and spoofing. Offline Analysis Unit (OAU) Based on the SRX software receiver [1] for processing the collected RF samples and by taking advantage of the accurate reference system and a common reference atomic clock integrated in the DASU platforms, the measurement errors (code, carrier phase and Doppler) can be accurately determined, and by using precise orbit, clock and ionosphere data from reliable sources (such as the IGS) it is possible to distingu...|$|E

30|$|Non-destructive {{inspection}} systems {{based on}} X-ray, Thermography and ultrasonic are commercial available for this task. A Volkswagen intern evaluation of this systems {{pointed out that}} no existing non-destructive testing system can solve the requirements for automated inline inspection. In the case of X-ray, there is possibility to detect small air gaps. Furthermore, this system has high demands on radioprotection. The Thermography has limited resolution {{and the result is}} difficult to interpret because of the many parasitic effects. Available systems based on ultrasonic phased array in impuls echo [11] or transmission mode [12] (<b>wheel</b> <b>probes,</b> probes with an elastic wedge) as well as single element sensors [13] are not useable for the inspection task of all three seam areas. Seam areas b and c are especially difficult to test due to their size and form. In addition, the process control loop for hand-guided inspection is not much shorter than the destructive test. Therefore a solution based on a multi probe phased array ultrasound system with a free configurability of different transmission and reflection measurements was proposed for an automated evaluation of the seam areas a, b and c (see Fig.  1) as an inline system in the automobile car body production. A VW standard requires that these areas achieve different degrees of adhesive filling. Seam areas a and b should be filled with a 100 and 30 % adhesive respectively [14]. These filling degrees are both measured from the seam loop c. In the seam loop c the entire surface of the sheet metal must be filled with adhesive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic {{testing is}} applied to monitor the curing process of GFRP {{laminates}} used for rehabilitation of aged sewerage pipes. Instead of conventional method in which through-thickness ultrasonic wave is used, <b>wheel</b> type <b>probes</b> are adopted to transmit and receive in-plane Lamb wave. It {{is well known that}} wave velocity depends on the stiffness of the propagating medium, so that it could be used as cure index of resin. However, because of the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of detected signals, determination of wave arrival time with zero-crossing detecting method leads to nonnegligible error. In order to improve the precision of measurement, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is introduced and the arrival time of Lamb wave is monitored in curing process. Two types of waveform, pulse and burst waves are examined to confirm the effect of waveform on the accuracy of measurement. It is found that the arrival time of Lamb wave decreases with the increase of cure degree, and approach asymptotically to constant value during post cure process. Also, AIC analysis with pulse wave is found to be more reliable to monitor the early stage of resin cure...|$|R
50|$|By 1987, only Mustang {{production}} {{remained at}} the Dearborn Assembly Plant (DAP). In 1987 Ford planned to replace that car with the front <b>wheel</b> drive Ford <b>Probe,</b> but public outcry quickly turned to surging sales. With the fourth-generation Mustang a success, the Rouge was saved as well. Ford decided to modernize its operations. A gas explosion on February 1, 1999, killed six employees and injured two dozen more, resulting in the idling of the power plant. Michigan Utility CMS Energy built a state-of-the-art Power Plant across Miller Road to replace the electricity and steam production, {{as well as the}} Blast-Furnace waste gas consumption of the original power plant. As it ended production, Dearborn Assembly Plant (DAP) was one of six plants within the Ford Rouge Center. The plant was open from 1918 to May 10, 2004, with a red convertible 2004 Ford Mustang GT being the last vehicle built at the historic site. Demolition of the historic DAP facility was completed in 2008. All that remains is a 3000 place parking lot to hold light truck production from the new Dearborn Truck Plant.|$|R
