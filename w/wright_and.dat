5|$|The Americans were {{alarmed by}} the Japanese buildup, which was {{accurately}} tracked through Ultra intelligence. Secretary of War Henry L.

DeBakey and Gilbert Beebe. <b>Wright</b> <b>and</b> Shockley estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4million casualties in such a scenario, of whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.|$|E

5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash {{in the course of}} their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma <b>Wright</b> <b>and</b> Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from <b>Wright</b> <b>and</b> Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E
