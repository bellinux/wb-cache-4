2500|$|... {{and this}} is not good. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> the {{opportunity}} to spread the purposes of Phi Sigma Pi. We must act." [...] At the time, colleges and universities were openly discouraging social fraternities, while promoting honor organizations and scholarship.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1972, Clough and Taylor signed David Nish from Leicester City, for a then-record {{transfer}} fee of £225,000, without consulting the Derby board. Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor {{there would be}} no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, on 3 September 1972, after the team had defeated Liverpool 2–1 at the Baseball Ground, Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that [...] "They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. I want to hear them when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing.</b> They are a disgraceful lot". In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club's board of directors for their policies. The following day, Board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough's remarks.|$|E
6000|$|He turned {{round on}} his friend. [...] "Look 'ere," [...] he said, [...] "we aren't gettin' on here. <b>We</b> <b>been</b> <b>losing</b> money hand over fist. We got things {{tied up in}} fifty knots." ...|$|R
50|$|The truth <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{being asked}} for My Bonnie {{but no one}} {{actually}} ordered it. Brian would order any record once we had a firm order for it. I thought that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> sales and I wrote an order in the book under the name Raymond Jones and, from that moment the legend grew.|$|R
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> already <b>losing</b> our {{credibility}} right now. Let us {{not lose}} the high ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then he {{was moved}} to frankness. [...] "Or rather--bad news. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing.</b> We are gaining no ground and the {{aeroplanes}} draw nearer and nearer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I go {{away with}} you, when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> by the farm, {{and when there}} is nobody to check the ruinous {{expenses}} but myself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> our heads, gentlemen," [...] he said; [...] "and I propose {{to you the}} health of the first citizen of Kentucky, Colonel George Rogers Clark." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, a {{side from}} Basel toured France and {{were on the}} end of record {{breaking}} defeats. They lost 127-0 to Grenoble, 104-3 to Thonon and 116-0 to Annecy. [...] The captain of the Basel team, Pierre Langlois said, [...] "We conceded 73 tries, I think. We even had a penalty try given against us when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> by 100 points." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{restructured}} and reorganized company {{developed an}} overarching strategy in 1993. According to Jim Ethier:The first strategic plan defined {{the process that}} would enable us {{to get out of}} products where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> money, as well as away from business processes that no longer made sense. It was a defining step in the [...] "re-architecting" [...] of the company.|$|R
60|$|We {{did not ask}} if we {{had brought}} poor Fischer's luck to any of them. We {{did not wish to}} know. We fully {{believed}} in Satan's desire to do us kindnesses, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> confidence in his judgment. It was at this time that our growing anxiety to have him look over our life-charts and suggest improvements began to fade out and give place to other interests.|$|R
6000|$|So I {{started up}} crying out, [...] "Then in God's name let us come at once, for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> time. The Count {{may come to}} Piccadilly earlier than we think." ...|$|E
6000|$|He sighed. [...] "I {{suppose it}} isn't our fault. You are right in one thing, at any rate. The {{world has been}} at peace too long. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> a healthy sense of suspicion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] Chris said, [...] "that instead of gaining ground <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> it. We can't see {{at all what}} is going on, but {{certainly}} the firing seems nearer than it was." ...|$|E
60|$|It was true, {{and after}} I had {{examined}} the damage I {{found it a}} much graver matter than I had anticipated. Not only was the forced angle at which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> compelled to maintain the bow {{in order to keep}} a horizontal course greatly impeding our speed, but at the rate that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> our repulsive rays from the forward tanks it was but a question of an hour or more when <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> floating stern up and helpless.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{if he has}} passed," [...] said I, [...] "why, then {{of course}} he will put up his plate and have his own house, and <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> our Edie." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{summer of}} 2004 saw the {{creation}} of the Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution. Founded by Manski during his last year of law school, this non-governmental organization was formed as a means to reinforce pro-democracy campaigns across the United States. Through Liberty Tree, Manski has helped solidify networks of people whose aim is to have a more participatory system of government. [...] "I had come to recognize that while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> winning any number of significant victories, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> the larger struggle for democratic self-governance." ...|$|R
60|$|I will spare what I {{think of}} the {{treatment}} in England of the Savoy question. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> all moral prestige {{in the eyes of}} the world, with our small jealousies and factional struggles for power.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the remotest {{suspicion}} what you mean, Mr. Moodie," [...] replied Hollingsworth; [...] "nobody, to my knowledge, {{has called for}} Priscilla, except yourself. But come; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> time, and I have several things {{to say to you}} by the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mother Anastasia laughed. [...] "This {{is really}} too much; please stop it. But you may lend me your hat. I {{did not know}} the morning would be so warm, and I am afraid I walked too fast. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> time. Will you tell me {{precisely}} what it is you wish to know of me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Auster's voice may {{be heard}} on the 2005 album {{entitled}} <b>We</b> Must <b>Be</b> <b>Losing</b> It by The Farangs. The two tracks are entitled [...] "Obituary in the Present Tense" [...] and [...] "Between the Lines".|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, John," [...] said she, turning round. [...] "You {{know how}} sorry <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to <b>lose</b> you. But it's {{a great thing}} for you to be going up to London." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kappen writes, [...] "Were we {{to succumb}} to the first, <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> our identity; if to the second, ours would be a false, {{obsolete}} identity in a mental universe of dead symbols and delayed myths".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{you put on}} more sail, sir?" [...] Mr. Ashmead, {{the member}} of the council, said to the captain. [...] "My wife, sir, objects {{to the sound of}} firearms, and I must really beg that you will {{increase}} your speed. As it is, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> rather than gaining upon that vessel behind. The duty of the ships of the Company is to try not to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Seaton smiled, as if {{she were}} encouraged. [...] "To go without is disappointing, but perhaps the {{dividend}} is not most important. I'd like to feel my shares were worth the money they cost, and find out they are not. We have drawn on the reserves and I expect this implies <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> money. You can't go on losing money very long, and we ought to stop while we have some capital left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is so eloquent {{as their}} iron tongues!" [...] exclaimed Oberon. [...] "My heart leaps and trembles, {{but not with}} fear. And that other sound, too,--deep and awful as a mighty organ,--the roar and thunder of the {{multitude}} on the pavement below! Come! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> time. I will cry out in the loudest of the uproar, and mingle my spirit with the wildest of the confusion, and be a bubble {{on the top of}} the ferment!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, {{while still}} {{teaching}} part-time at Stanford, {{he was hired}} as head football coach at Tamalpais High School, in Mill Valley, California. His son {{was one of three}} seniors on the varsity team, which had gone 2-8 the year before. In 1980, they were 0-11. Meggyesy later said, [...] "We went 0-11, but it was a great experience to see them mature and gain confidence even when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing.</b> High school football is football in its purest form. It struck me what a crucible for learning it was." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{changing}} conditions saw the Michelin {{advantage in}} the dry superseded by Bridgestone dominance in the wet. Michelin motorsport director Pierre Dupasquier said: [...] "Today's race was absolutely fascinating from a technical perspective. We set the early pace, and our drivers were the quickest out there when the circuit dried towards the end. In slightly damp conditions, our grooved dry weather tyres enabled our leading drivers to run up to three seconds per lap faster than Michael Schumacher. In wetter conditions, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> two seconds per lap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{so you are}} to see Prince Rupert to-day, Cyril?" [...] Captain Dave said. [...] "I <b>am</b> afraid <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> you, for he will, I should say, assuredly appoint you {{to one of his}} ships if you ask him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Of course, as {{yet there}} are a few slight {{difficulties}} and [...] deficiencies, just as there are with us in America. We have [...] had the same trouble with wood-alcohol (they call it [...] methylated spirit here), with the same deplorable results. [...] On some days the list of deaths is very serious, and in some [...] cases <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> men we can hardly spare. A great many of [...] our leading actors--in fact, most of them--are dead. And there [...] has been a heavy loss, too, among the literary class and in [...] the legal profession.|$|E
6000|$|Britt went on: [...] "We {{must always}} {{remember}} that every age is an age of transition. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> faith in the revelations of the past, {{but we should not}} presume to define the faith of the future. Men will not live in the hopelessness which the monists would thrust upon them, they will not patiently wait while Pasteur and Koch and the other germ theorists labor to prolong the life of some other generation. They will always insist on having something to live for and to die for. I don't pretend to say what this faith will be, but it will be sufficing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Noble gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "if the felicitations of one humble as I {{can add to}} the {{pleasure}} of this happy meeting, I beg you to accept them; but the wind has no heart for friendships nor any thought for the gains or losses of us watermen. I feel it my duty, as patron of the bark, to recall to your honors that many poor travellers, far {{from their homes and}} pining families, are waiting our leisure, not to speak of foot-sore pilgrims and other worthy adventurers, who are impatient in their hearts, though respect for their superiors keeps them tongue-tied, while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>losing</b> the best of the breeze." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to <b>lose</b> you, then Mr. Laverick," [...] Streuss remarked with {{a gesture}} of farewell, [...] "let us say good night. The little matter of {{business}} which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> discussing can be concluded with your partner." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pastora {{had three}} failed marriages. Lamenting about the {{interpersonal}} strains {{that occur in}} the life of a revolutionary, Pastora said: [...] "The first thing <b>we</b> revolutionaries <b>lose</b> <b>is</b> our wives. The last thing <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> <b>is</b> our lives. In between our women and our lives, we lose our freedom, our happiness, our means of living." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{confirmed}} by TV Week that Packed to the Rafters has been cancelled and would finish in July {{with a big}} two-hour season finale, which would see the return of Hugh Sheridan, Jessica Marais, Ryan Corr, Jessica McNamee and James Stewart. Rebecca Gibney said, [...] "The cast, writers and producers have always said {{that we wanted to}} keep Rafters as one of the most-watched shows on TV. If we ever felt like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>losing</b> too many cast members, we needed to end it on a high. We can say season six winds up an aspect of the Rafter family and {{there is a sense of}} finality to it." ...|$|R
