5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E

25|$|As most {{traditional}} houses in Indonesia, spatial orientation and hierarchy are crucial considerations in Balinese architecture. The concept {{is based on}} the Hindu dharma principle: every objects in the universe is conceived as having an ideal location; this must be correctly aligned at all time in order to achieve harmony <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and thus moksha – the point of liberation where a human achieves a perfect state of being – can be achieved. The placement of objects in Balinese architecture naturally plays an important role to achieve this.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, quantum mechanics—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of events. Before that, Newtonian physics—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an approximation to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, absolute knowledge of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{situation}} occurs in general relativity with the gravitational singularity {{associated with the}} Schwarzschild solution that describes the geometry of a black hole. The curvature of spacetime at the singularity is infinite which {{is another way of}} stating that the theory does not describe the physical conditions at this point. It is hoped that the solution to this paradox will be found with a consistent theory of quantum gravity, something which has thus far remained elusive. A consequence of this paradox is that the associated singularity that occurred at the supposed starting point of the universe (see Big Bang) is not adequately described by physics. Before a theoretical extrapolation of a singularity can occur, quantum mechanical effects become important in an era known as the Planck time. Without a consistent theory, there can be no meaningful statement about the physical conditions associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> before this point.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{important}} axioms in set theory which assert {{the existence of}} a proper class of cardinals which satisfy a predicate of interest. In the case of inaccessibility, the corresponding axiom is the assertion that for every cardinal μ, there is an inaccessible cardinal κ which is strictly larger, μ < κ. Thus this axiom guarantees {{the existence of a}}n infinite tower of inaccessible cardinals (and may occasionally be referred to as the inaccessible cardinal axiom). As is the case for the existence of any inaccessible cardinal, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is unprovable from the axioms of ZFC. Assuming ZFC, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is equivalent to the universe axiom of Grothendieck and Verdier: every set is contained in a Grothendieck universe. The axioms of ZFC along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> axiom (or equivalently the inaccessible cardinal axiom) are denoted ZFCU (which could be confused with ZFC with urelements). This axiomatic system is useful to prove for example that every category has an appropriate Yoneda embedding.|$|E
25|$|Jung's work {{on himself}} and his {{patients}} convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep innate potential. Based on his study of Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, Taoism, and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called individuation, is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the self {{and at the same}} time to meet the Divine. Unlike Freud's objectivist worldview, Jung's pantheism may have led him to believe that spiritual experience was essential to our well-being, as he specifically identifies individual human life <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> as a whole. Jung's ideas on religion gave a counterbalance to the Freudian scepticism of religion. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation has been quite popular and is still treated in modern textbooks on the psychology of religion, though his ideas have also been criticized.|$|E
25|$|Bringing {{these two}} thesis {{together}}, Unger theorizes that {{laws of nature}} develop together with the phenomenon they explain. Laws and initial conditions co-evolve, in the same that they do in how cells reproduce and mutate in different levels of complexity of organisms. In cosmological terms Unger explains the passing from one structure to another at {{the origins of the}} universe when the state of energy was high but not infinite, and the freedom of movement was greater than when operating under a known set of laws. The conditions of the early universe is compatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> that preceded it. The new universe may be different in structure, but has been made with what existed in the old one, e.g. masses of elementary particles, strength of different forces, and cosmological constants. As the universe cools the phenomena and laws work together with materials produced by sequence; they are path dependent materials. They are also constrained by the family of resemblances of the effective laws against the background of the conceptions of alternative states the universe and succession of universes.|$|E

25|$|Theism {{generally}} {{holds that}} God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and interacting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> through, for example, religious {{experience and the}} prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present {{in the affairs of}} the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, {{due to the nature of}} time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism.Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it. In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe.|$|E

500|$|Where possible, the {{developers}} drew on or adapted assets from Halo 3 and Reach. For elements {{that had no}} analogues, Microsoft sent art director Ben Cammarano to Saber's offices in St. Petersburg, Russia, to oversee the redesign of the game's visuals. Cammarano established four tenets of Halo—what Iones termed [...] "heroic vistas, iconic imagery and characters, clean and vibrant aesthetics, and visceral action"—to guide Saber's artists. Since the original assets already existed, concept artists took screenshots from the original game and painted over new looks to show how environmental effects, improved lighting, and new textures could change {{the look of the}} levels. Some of Saber's visual designs were considered too much of a departure from the original game—while the artists had changed the position of the Halo ringworld and nearby planets to make a more pleasing skybox, Microsoft insisted maintaining continuity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> was more important and vetoed the changes. Vocal fans pointed out other inconsistencies with the game's visuals in prerelease trailers and pictures that Saber ultimately changed. Iones pointed to the floor designs of the Forerunner structures, the assault rifle, and the look of the Chief as places fans had an impact. The Chief's armor was redesigned from scratch instead of porting existing assets.|$|E
500|$|... "Para Qué Sufrir" [...] is a {{song about}} being all right and trusting someone. Lafourcade wrote the song {{in a short time}} but had {{problems}} with the chorus, so she asked Torreblanca's lead singer Jose Manuel Torreblanca for help; López did the arrangements. [...] "Nunca es Suficiente" [...] deals with emotions about a dysfunctional relationship and wanting something more. It was composed by Lafourcade and Daniela Azpiazu and was intended to be performed by Mexican artist Paulina Rubio, since both Lafourcade and Azpiazu wanted to write songs for other artists. However, upon finishing it, they decided to keep the song to themselves and use it either for Aziapizu's project María Daniela y su Sonido Lasser or Lafourcade's album. According to Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice, the song resembles Belle and Sebastian's The Life Pursuit [...] "in its treatment of Sixties-era pop inspirations". Mariano Prunes of AllMusic compared the track to the work of Spanish singer Jeanette on the song [...] "Porque Te Vas". Lafourcade decided upon the album's title between the songs [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] and [...] "Palomas Blancas"; the latter was written in Las Vegas, during her trip to the Grammy Awards. It is a love story filled with metaphors about her love for Mexico, connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and self-preservation. The song had the most modified arrangement, being made with few chords.|$|E
