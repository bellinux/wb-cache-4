25|$|Humankind {{gradually}} {{evolved from}} early {{members of the}} genus Homo—such as Homo habilis, who used simple stone tools—into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) during the Paleolithic era. During {{the end of the}} Paleolithic, specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce the earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual. The climate during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool</b> temperatures. Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of Paleolithic humans survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.|$|E
25|$|Le Pont aux Anglais, soleil couchant is an oil {{painting}} on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 54 x 73cm (21.25 by 28.75 in), signed R Pinchon lower left. The composition painted en plein air (sur le motif, {{in the open}} air), {{is dominated by the}} Pont aux Anglais, Rouen, with receding perspective tending towards {{the right side of the}} canvas. A locomotive and train cars pass over the bridge leaving a trail of steam in the direction of the receding perspective, carrying the eye towards the right, where below, a boat passes carrying two people a short distance from Le Pont aux Anglais. The rhythmic arches of the bridge and the speeding train create a sense of dynamism and modernity not often found in Post-Impressionist works. The colors Pinchon has chosen to depict this late afternoon scene are both <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool.</b> The golden yellow highlights generated by the setting sun, off the canvas to the left, are juxtaposed against the grays, blues, violets and greens of the background hillside, the bridge and its massive base pillars, the poplar trees and the River Seine in the foreground.|$|E

Two {{days before the}} release of the EP, [...] the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered [...] "Xiangjiao". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because everything seemed super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool.</b> I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} body <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> {{on the heart}} and {{breathing}} rates has been studied in the agamid lizard Uromastyx mi-crolipes. Electrocardiograph (ECG) of Uromastyx microlipes consists of P, QRS, and T components {{similar to those in}} mammals. Heart rate increases with body temperature. During warming the heart rate ranged from 7 - 134 beat/min, while during cooling ranged from 2 - 73 beat/min. The mean of heart rate during <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> was not significantly different except at body temperatures of 20 ºC and 35 ºC. In two lizards heart rate was higher during warming than cooling for all temperatures. Both breathing types (thoracic and buccal) increased in frequency with body temperature. The range of thoracic breathing rates during both <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooling</b> was 0 - 20 breath/min. Buccal breathing rate was 0 - 24 breath/min during <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> 0 - 26 breath/ min during cooling...|$|R

2500|$|The {{climate in}} the Permian was quite varied. At {{the start of}} the Permian, the Earth was still in an ice age, which began in the Carboniferous.

[...] In the late Permian period, the drying continued although the temperature cycled between <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool</b> cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature [...] affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) , while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool.</b> Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). [...] Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. [...] For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E

50|$|This {{comparison}} of <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool</b> also enables the lighting designer {{to shift the}} balance of the <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>cool</b> lanterns in accordance of what time of day it is.

However, as it becomes later in the day, the cool lantern would become brighter than the warm lantern, so the light upon the actors face becomes cooler overall, suggesting to the audience that the time has shifted into the evening, without any mention of time in the scene itself.|$|E
