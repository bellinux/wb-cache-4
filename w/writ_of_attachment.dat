5|$|During {{the early}} 1720s, a {{constitutional}} struggle began between the Provost and the Fellows, {{culminating in a}} lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, Edmund Gibson, then Bishop of Lincoln. The Provost continued to reject candidates, fuelling discontent among the Fellows, until a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the original statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second versiont, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue in}} this case {{involved}} a court ordered liquidation {{of a piece of}} land which had been purchased by Neff. [...] Neff was not a resident of the state in which the land was located. In ordering a sale of the land to fulfill a judgment, the court had failed to issue proper notice to Neff, who resided in another state. [...] The service had not been in personam. [...] The Supreme Court ruled that the sale of the land was illegal because the service of the notice or subpoena had not been proper. [...] There is no personal jurisdiction over a defendant unless the defendant is served with a subpoena while physically within the state where [...] the court issuing the subpoena is located and has jurisdiction.

5000|$|A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> is a {{court order}} to [...] "attach" [...] or seize an asset. [...] It is issued by a court to a law {{enforcement}} officer or sheriff. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> is issued in order to satisfy a judgment issued by the court. A prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> may be used to freeze assets of a defendant while a legal action is pending. Common grounds for obtaining a prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> are that a defendant has committed fraud or that a defendant is prepared to hide assets from a court.|$|E
50|$|A prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> may {{be ordered}} {{in a legal}} action where a {{plaintiff}} has demonstrated meritorious allegations, fraud in the underlying action, or that defendant may attempt to dispose of or hide assets from the court. In this context, a prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> functions much like {{a temporary restraining order}} (TRO), which preserves the status quo pending a final resolution of the dispute. However, unlike a TRO, a prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> provides a source of financial recovery for a plaintiff. Usually, a plaintiff seeking a prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> must post a surety bond of up to two times the amount of the damages claimed by the plaintiff.|$|E
