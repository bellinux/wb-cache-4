5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult <b>with</b> <b>lawyers</b> and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked <b>with</b> <b>lawyers</b> for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.presidents are not immune to civil suit.|$|E
25|$|Based on her account, {{claiming}} to have been raped by several black men, the police quickly arrested Frank Hairston, Jr. and Booker Millner.

The last to be arrested, Joe Hampton, was taken into custody on January 10. All but one man was in his early 20s. After being held by police overnight, the first six all signed confessions, implicating themselves and each other. All admitted to being present at the crime, including Joe Hampton, although not all took part in rape. Only one of the accused had a prior criminal record, and most of the men were employed.

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been conducted on defendants’ satisfaction with the police, courts and prisons, little is known about defendants’ satisfaction <b>with</b> their <b>lawyers.</b> Therefore this study investigates: (1) to what extent there are differences between defendants in the satisfaction <b>with</b> their <b>lawyers,</b> and (2) to what extent differences in defendants’ perceptions of procedural fairness and the involvement of the lawyer affect defendants’ satisfaction <b>with</b> their <b>lawyers.</b> Data of the Prison Project were used: a large-scale researchproject among Dutch criminal defendants (N= 532). Results suggested that generally, defendants are very satisfied <b>with</b> their <b>lawyers.</b> This can be attributed to procedural fairness characteristics and the frequency of contact between the defendant and his lawyer...|$|R
