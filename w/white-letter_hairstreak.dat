5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E
5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
50|$|The former Stow St Mary Halt {{railway station}} has marshes, a pond and scrub, {{together}} with adjoining pasture {{which is also}} part of the reserve. Butterflies include purple and <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreaks,</b> and there are flowers such as common fleabane and wild carrot.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the site}} is semi-deciduous {{woodland}} which has woodpeckers and muntjac deer, and butterflies including <b>white-letter</b> and purple <b>hairstreaks.</b> In grassland areas there are the rare adder's-tongue fern and the locally scarce four-spot orb weaver spider.|$|R
5000|$|Dead {{oak trees}} provide habitat for several beetles which are scarce in Surrey {{including}} Nemadus colonoides and Aridius nodifer [...] Two moths which occur, the toadflax brocade and the {{broad-bordered bee hawkmoth}} are nationally rare. This is a well-known site for the purple emperor, and other scarce butterflies which are present include <b>white-letter</b> and purple <b>hairstreaks</b> and the white admiral.|$|R
25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; ramsons (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple hairstreak, <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> and speckled wood butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and stag beetles. Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E

50|$|The {{common is}} mostly wooded, {{dominated}} by pedunculate oak, with some hornbeam, beech and field maples. Holly forms a dense understorey in some places, while elsewhere {{a more diverse}} shrub layer includes Midland hawthorn and hazel. Several ground flora species are ancient woodland indicators, suggesting that fragments have survived from before {{the time when the}} common was managed as wood-pasture. Butterflies include <b>white-letter</b> and purple <b>hairstreaks,</b> and there are breeding birds such as sparrowhawk and tawny owl.|$|R

50|$|The {{site has}} salt marshes, mudflats, scrub and grassland. The marshes and mudflats have internationally {{important}} numbers of wildfowl and waders, including the dark-bellied brent goose, grey plover, redshank and knot. Some areas {{are very important}} for scarce invertebrates, such as <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> and marbled white butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{information}} on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not {{be consistent with the}} species in other parts of its range.This small brown butterfly is very similar to the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> but the black hairstreak has a row of orange spots {{along the edge of the}} upper-side hindwing. In the female these spots also extend to the forewings. The undersides are similar to the white-letter but the white line tends to be straighter and the orange border extends onto the forewings. The most conclusive way to distinguish the two is by the row of black spots accompanying the orange band which the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> never has. They spend most of their lives in the canopy or in dense scrub, feeding on honeydew, and very rarely come down to ground level.|$|E
50|$|Trees in this wood include oak, ash {{and field}} maple, {{together}} with some elms, although many {{were killed by}} Dutch elm disease. Invertebrates include the rare white-spotted pinion moth, which depends on elms for food for its larvae, and <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterflies. The dead elms provide a habitat {{for a wide variety}} of fungi.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Morfeo' was {{introduced}} to the UK as a potential host plant for the <b>White-letter</b> <b>Hairstreak</b> butterfly Satyrium w-album by Butterfly Conservation. [...] The tree has proven very fast growing, the fastest of 13 cultivars on trial on a shallow sandy, gravelly loam over Reading Beds, increasing in stem diameter by 2.1 cm per annum. 'Morfeo' is also tolerant of heavy winter-wet soils.|$|E
50|$|Specimens planted at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens in Hampshire, England, in 1977 {{have grown}} very well on heavy clay {{in an open}} location, where they support colonies of the <b>White-letter</b> <b>Hairstreak</b> Satyrium w-album. In trials {{elsewhere}} in Hampshire conducted by Butterfly Conservation, the tree also proved tolerant of dry soils on chalk and soils waterlogged in winter, although growth has been comparatively slow. The species is not known to sucker from roots.|$|E
50|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland.

50|$|Twinhills Woods and Meadows {{comprise}} {{a complex of}} ancient, semi-natural woodland, neutral and calcareous grassland with associated mature hedges and areas of shrub growth. Further interest is added {{by the presence of}} a large number of butterfly species on the site. A total of 26 species have been recorded including grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium w-album), green-veined white (Pieris napi), brown argus (Aricia agestis), marbled white (Melangargia galthea), silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia) and marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia).|$|E
5000|$|Ulmus ''''Plinio'''' is {{a hybrid}} elm {{cultivar}} {{derived from a}} crossing of the Dutch cultivar 'Plantyn' (female parent) with the Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila clone 'S.2'. 'Plinio' was raised by the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante (IPP), in Florence and released for sale in 2003.

50|$|The reserve has boasted 27 {{different}} varieties of butterfly including the large skipper, the speckled wood, <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> small copper, holly blue and the brown argus. The reservoir is stocked with trout {{and is available}} for angling {{between the end of}} March and the middle of December. One reason for the plentiful fish might be the large abundance of aquatic invertebrates - including dragonfly larvae, water boatman, great diving beetles (and larvae), pond skaters, water scorpions and silver diving beetles.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, the tree has enjoyed a small renaissance in England. A popular larval host plant of the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> Satyrium w-album butterfly across Europe, the elm is now being planted by Butterfly Conservation and other groups to restore local populations decimated by the effects of Dutch elm disease on native or archaeophytic elms. The Cheshire Wildlife Trust, for example, planted numerous white elms on its reserves in the former Vale Royal district of the county.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, 80 {{trees were}} {{donated to the}} Greater London Council {{as part of the}} grower's European Elm City promotion; similar gifts were also made to Belfast, Cardiff (Pontcanna Park), and Hamburg (the central City Park). In 2010, 100 trees were planted in the London borough of Enfield to aid and abet the {{conservation}} of the <b>White-letter</b> <b>Hairstreak</b> Satyrium w-album. http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23808776-rare-butterflies-given-a-new-leaf-of-life.do Another hundred were included in the tree planting at the Olympic Park.

5000|$|Over 5000 [...] {{were planted}} on the Isle of Wight by Natural Enterprise, and in smaller numbers in Hampshire by Butterfly Conservation and the Forestry Commission, in the hope the tree would host the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> {{butterfly}} (Satyrium w-album), a monophagic species which remains in serious decline {{as a consequence of}} Dutch elm disease. This was confirmed in 2015 with the discovery of the butterfly breeding on a specimen planted in 2003 at Towngate, Newport, Isle of Wight (see photos 3 and 4 in Gallery).|$|E
50|$|The Heritage Lottery Fund gave a {{grant of}} £20,000 in May 2006 to help restore the gardens which {{received}} a major revamp {{with the creation of}} an educational woodland walk and butterfly habitat. The Friends group forged links with local schools who use the park for outdoor projects such as mini-beast and pond studies. Also the Lancashire Wildlife Trust is monitoring the rare <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly which lives in the gardens. The Woodland Walk is designed to include a story telling ring, disabled friendly winding paths, a sculpture display area and mosaics.|$|E
50|$|The wood {{is home to}} {{at least}} 25 {{different}} species of butterfly, which are particularly found {{in the area of}} open grassland in the Toothill section. Three rare species have been sighted, namely the grizzled skipper, the small blue and the <b>white-letter</b> <b>hairstreak.</b> The Duke of Burgundy was also recorded in the wood in 1989. 251 different moth species have been recorded in the wood, including five species classified as 'nationally notable b', meaning that they have been recorded in less than 4% of Great Britain. These species are Drepana cultraria, Paradarisa consonaria, Paradarisa extersaria, Cerastis leucographa and Lithophane hepatica.|$|E
