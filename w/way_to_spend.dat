5|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) {{originally}} {{announced a}} remake of the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur in December 1952, ostensibly as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> its Italian assets. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported {{to be in the}} running for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced it would make the film in CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954. In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it. Sidney Franklin was scheduled to direct, with Marlon Brando intended for the lead. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process, MGM Camera 65. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956, following Franklin's resignation.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Board's business was derived from the evening fares of people going out to social functions or events at places such as cinemas, dance halls, clubs, and the like. The introduction of television in the early 1960s gave people a new and more convenient <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> their leisure time, significantly impacting on the popularity of these types of activities. A fall of 19% in the Board's revenue between 1962 and 1968 was largely down to the sale of fewer off-peak fares.|$|E

One of the two sweeping track is located at a lockable manhole through which the U-Bahn carriages can be replaced if necessary by using a crane. This currently represents the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> U-Bahn carriages in the tunnel, because the line U55 with the U5 does not track connections {{to the rest of}} the underground network to the gap closure.|$|E

25|$|Producers and producer-groups {{spend this}} social premium to support {{socioeconomic}} {{development in a}} variety of ways. One common <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a rise in}} the {{popularity}} of football in London dates {{from the end of the}} 19th century, when a fall in church attendance left many people searching for a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> their weekend leisure time. In 1882 the London Football Association was set up. Over the next 25 years clubs sprang up all over the capital, and the majority of these teams are still thriving in the 21st century. Of those clubs currently playing in the Football League, Fulham is generally considered to be London's oldest club still in existence, having been founded in 1879. However, Isthmian League side Cray Wanderers is the oldest extant club in all of the Greater London area, having been founded in 1860 in St Mary Cray | (then part of Kent but now in the London Borough of Bromley).|$|E

25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> time. The {{only problem was}} that they were often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E

500|$|David Greenwald of Billboard {{magazine}} described [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] as a [...] "profanity-laced and Clash-channeling" [...] track. Zara Golden of VH1 {{said of the}} video, [...] "The hit is only {{a symbolic}} one, though, and the only real violence to be had here is a slaying guitar riff. Rather, this is an assault against the dubbed-out sound {{that seems to be}} dominating today’s air waves, Green Day’s own and only pretend bloody dubstep demolition." [...] Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times, criticizing the single, said, [...] "It's all played rather straight. 'I'll pick up what's left in the club,' Armstrong sings suspiciously, and the video released Tuesday doesn't do much to present the song as a statement". Alex Young, writing for Consequence of Sound said the opening clips of the band driving motorbikes were irrelevant. Young said, [...] "There’s also a random scene of the band riding dirt bikes through the desert, which doesn't really make sense {{in the context of the}} video but seems like a good <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> an excess video budget".|$|E
500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is {{probably}} not going to put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the producers include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E
