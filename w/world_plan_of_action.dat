40|$|Nigeria's ambitious {{population}} policy, {{adopted in}} 1988, had {{its origins in}} the international population and development thinking of the time, set out in documents such as the <b>World</b> Population <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> and the Kilimanjaro Programme <b>of</b> <b>Action.</b> The policy has had at most a modest effect in curbing the country's high fertility. This failure, it is argued, stems from the policy's implicit assumption of a single, monolithic cultural reality and its disregard of male reproductive motivation. Belief systems in Nigeria are extraordinarily diverse in detail but share a common interest in the fertility of crops, livestock, and people. Patterns of social organization are similarly varied. For an effective population policy, {{the government needs to}} find ways of incorporating distinct elements of the cultures of the different ethnic groups, leveraging rather than suppressing the country's cultural diversity.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} {{in the area of}} humanitarian responses and the publication and dissemination of various guidelines with regard to nutritional interventions, there is, however a paucity of studies which have examined the human right to food in complex emergencies. 186 countries including those affected by both human made and natural disasters and countries who are donors of humanitarian relief aid adopted the Rome Declaration on Food Security and <b>World</b> Summit <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> reaffirming “ the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”.

40|$|This {{work offers}} an anthropological {{analysis}} of intra-household processes underlying gender-and age-specific differences in individual nutritional {{and health care}} allocations and outcomes in particular cultures. Based on recent ethnographic studies in India, Nepal, Madagascar, Mexico, and Peru, correspondences are analyzed between local cultural ("emic") and scientist-policy maker-practitioner ("etic") understandings of nutrition, health, and human development, and the relative "values" of females, males, and children of different ages. The data and analyses clarify specific epidemiological and demographic findings on age and gender bias in nutrition and health and highlight the multiple cultural, economic, and biological {{factors that contribute to}} gender- or age-based discrimination or neglect. Recent advances in nutrition policy have argued for a broader concept of nutritional security, one that incorporates both food quantity and quality, and of nutrition as "food, health, and care" (International Conference on Nutrition, <b>World</b> Declaration and <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> for Nutrition, FAO/WHO, Rome, 1992). These ethnographic findings lend strong support for such broader nutrition concepts and associated nutrition policies. The studies also suggest ways in which anthropological questions, methods, and data and community-based research can help predict or identify the nutritionally vulnerable within households and help other social and medical scientists design more effective interventions.

For proper and efficient use of soils and plant/animal genetic material, knowledge of the role of climate is an essential precondition. Several elements of the chapters in Agenda 21, a global <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> agreed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), require the attention of the agrometeorologists and these have been reviewed. Three International Conventions which have a bearing on sustainable agriculture including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) were negotiated and ratified since 1992. The <b>World</b> Food Summit <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> (WFSPA), which was developed in 1996, includes several commitments to make agricultural production sustainable. Agrometeorological aspects of these three Conventions and the WFSPA were reviewed. Some of the priorities for agrometeorologists to address sustainable agriculture in the 21 st Century were discussed. These include improvement and strengthening of agrometeorological networks, development of new sources of data for operational agrometeorology, improved understanding of natural climate variability, promotion and use of seasonal to inter-annual climate forecasts, establishment and/or strengthening of early warning and monitoring systems and promotion of geographical information systems and remote sensing applications and agroecological zoning for sustainable managemen...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} is {{the leading}} cause of blindness(1) and a major cause of severe morbidity and mortality among young children throughout the world(2). Vitamin A deficiency is considered a public health problem in India. However, the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency has declined from 2 % in 1975 - 79 to 0. 7 % in 1988 - 90 (3). A recent meta analysis of eight controlled trials estimates that community wide vitamin A supple-mentation can result in a 23 % average reduc-tion in child mortality rates(4). Accordingly, signatory nations of 1992 <b>World</b> Declaration and <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> for Nutrition have pledged to eliminate vitamin A deficiency by the year 2000 (5). Routine vitamin A supplementation in under-five children has been recommended to improve child survival(6). The World Health Organization/United Nations Children Fund/International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) Task Force recommends universal distribution of vitamin A in countries where xerophthalmia is a public health problem(7). It is recommended to orally supplement 100, 000 IU of vitamin A to infants and 200, 000 IU of vitamin A to children between 1 to 6 years of age every 6 months. The Government of India also recommends uni-versal supplementation of 100, 000 IU to all children along with measles vaccine(8). Recently, various workers have reported toxicity of vitamin A with doses as little as 25, 000 - 50, 000 IU(9, 10). Similar studies have been conducted in Nepal(11) and Indo-nesia(12). Also few reports are available on toxicity with 100, 000 IU of vitamin A given along with measles vaccine(13). Therefore, safety of vitamin A megadose given along with measles vaccination needs to be established.

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa some 80 % of {{the poor}} live in rural areas and derive most of their incomes, whether in kind or in cash, from agriculture; {{economic}} development {{that is based on}} agriculture and benefits the mass of the population and the building of development-oriented local government structures providing a wide range of services are therefore essential if poverty is to be reduced. Both aspects have been repeatedly overlooked because of erroneous assessments of the employment, economic linkage and value added potential of peasant farming and the disdain in which the development-promoting significance of rural communities is held; since the 1980 s international development cooperation has, moreover, increasingly shifted the emphasis in its promotion to physical and social infrastructure and the service sectors, principally in the industrial and urban sphere. At the same time, there has been a growing realization that the task for rural and agricultural development to proceed sustainably and have the effect of reducing poverty will become a complex, cross-sectional one; this can no longer be performed with conventional approaches to development based on project aid; this is equally true of all globally designed action programmes that influence sustainable agricultural and rural development, such as the implementation of Agenda 21, the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> to implement the Desertification Convention, the <b>World</b> Food Summit <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> and the implementation of the poverty reduction strategies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. From these facts, omissions and findings it must be concluded that poverty reduction in all Africa's agricultural countries should be achieved primarily through agriculturally based development, in which local government must play a role in promoting local economic development, coordinating the intersectoral activities and bridging the service gap between national and local level; this can be achieved only by means of gradual political, institutional and fiscal decentralization. As the rural communities will have to bear the main administrative burden of poverty-reducing development in the future, they must be sustainably strengthened with national and international support; a beneficial agricultural policy environment, realignment of international development cooperation and jointly financed and democratically controlled district development funds are prerequisites for broad-based, poverty-oriented rural development.

40|$|The author revives the {{brilliant}} past of demographic science, with after its final {{start in the}} 17 -th and 18 -th centuries found its proper denomination {{in the middle of}} the 19 -th century after some hesitation and its definite shape among other disciplines only on the turn of the 19 -th and 20 -th centuries. From this time on its importance and significance was rapidly growing, especially in international life among social sciences and international practice. The author raises the question of how the process of the internationalization of the demographic problem was produced in the 20 -th century, by evocating the main stages of this process, At the beginning in 1927, it was the League of Nations that took the initiative to create an International Union for the Scientific Study of Population. It was inaugurated in 1928 and held its first world congress in London in 1931. In this international scientific framework, however, only the demographic problems of the great powers were dealt with, i. e. the failure of the rigidly formulated Malthusian tenets and their possible consequences for the Western world. In this scientific climate the problems of the losers of World War 1 passed unnoticed, despite the fact that radical views of the internationalization of the demographic problem were elaborated and even politically exploited under the „Lebensraum" — theories aspect. This antagonism soon became apparent by the disruption of the 1937 Berlin Congress of the IUSSP, the 1947 reorganization of which started a new era in the internationalization of the demographic problem. This new period was again characterized by the prevailing authority of the new international body, the United Nations organizations, and by a shift of the international demographic problem towards the developing nations and their „demographic explosion". The international demographic congresses held after 1947 were desperately struggling with the complexity of the problem involving demography, population policy, economics and even sociology. Despite efforts to accumulate a solid scientific basis to the solution of the internationalized, demographic problems, they have not brought up generalized solutions, optimists and pessimists remaining strongly divided. These major difficulties worked in favour of a kind of „nationalization" of the problem around 1965 by looking for different national ways and means of the solution in the developing countries with admission of the necessity of restrictive population policies. From this time on a trend toward the international politicization of the problem is perceptible in demography as a new approximation on the side of or superposed on the mainly demographic or economic policy alternatives. The result of this change in scientific approximation may be seen in the 1974 Bucharest Congress held under the auspices of the UNO and the underlying <b>World</b> Population <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> and its linkage with human rights and women liberation. The author claims that the provisions <b>of</b> this <b>plan</b> for international co-operation are opening up a new era in this field, the development of which may not yet be foreseen in its main aspects, but may be characterized by its optimistic approach to the problem.
