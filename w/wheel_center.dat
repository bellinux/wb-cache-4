Other unique characteristics of the Z16 (Commemorative Edition Z06) are the polished aluminum wheels, special paint color and striping, and commemorative-edition badging and <b>wheel</b> <b>center</b> caps.

50|$|The centerbore of a {{wheel is}} the size of the hole {{in the back of the}} <b>wheel</b> that <b>centers</b> it over the {{mounting}} hub of the car. Some factory wheels have a centerbore that matches exactly with the hub to reduce vibration by keeping the <b>wheel</b> <b>centered.</b> <b>Wheels</b> with the correct centerbore to the car they will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the lug nuts, reducing the job of the lug nuts to <b>center</b> the <b>wheel</b> to the car. Wheels that are not hubcentric are known as lugcentric, as the job of centering is done by the lug nuts assuming they are properly torqued down.|$|R
50|$|The {{total amount}} of weight {{transfer}} is only affected by four factors: the distance between <b>wheel</b> <b>centers</b> (wheelbase {{in the case of}} braking, or track width in the case of cornering) the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.|$|R

I {{was thinking of}} the curve traced by a particle on a wheel mounted on a wheel mounted on a wheel, each turning at a different rate. The first term represents the largest wheel, of radius 1, turning counter-clockwise at one radian per second. The second term represents a smaller <b>wheel</b> <b>centered</b> {{at the edge of the}} first, turning 7 times as fast.

50|$|Most alloy {{wheels are}} {{manufactured}} using casting, {{but some are}} forged. Forged wheels are usually lighter, stronger, but much more expensive than cast wheels. There {{are two types of}} forged wheels: one piece and modular. Modular forged wheels may feature two- or three-piece design. Typical multi-piece wheels consist of the inner rim base, outer rim lip and <b>wheel</b> <b>center</b> piece with openings for lug nuts. All parts of a modular wheel are held with bolts. BBS RS {{is one of the most}} famous three-piece modular forged wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of the geometric roll center is solely dictated by the suspension geometry, {{and can be found}} using principles of the instant center of rotation. The SAE's definition of the force based roll center is, [...] "The point in the transverse vertical plane through any pair of <b>wheel</b> <b>centers</b> at which lateral forces may be applied to the sprung mass without producing suspension roll".|$|R
50|$|The <b>Center</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Market is a {{historic}} public market located along Market Street between 22nd and 23rd Streets in Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia. It consists of the <b>Center</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Market building {{as well as the}} <b>Center</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Fish Market. The 1853 <b>Center</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Market building was designed by architect Thomas Pope as an open market. The building is of neo-classical style with three bays and structural cast iron Doric order columns. It has a gable roof and features a belfry complete with bell. The 1890 open brick, neo-Romanesque section was designed by Wheeling architect Edward B. Franzheim. It has brick piers that support a hipped roof with cross gables and a three-foot overhang. In 1900, a wooden enclosure was built at the northern bay to house the <b>Center</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Fish Market.|$|R
50|$|The Demonstrator White {{color was}} used in 1950 on Cubs between serial numbers 99356 to 106516. These White Demo Cubs {{were used in the}} IH special {{demonstration}} program by dealers to highlight the abilities of the tractor. The tractors were painted white with red <b>wheel</b> <b>centers.</b> Dealers were expected to repaint these tractors back to IH Red before sale. However, some of these demonstrators were sold without being repainted.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, all {{push-button}} transmission selectors {{became a}} safety issue {{due to lack}} of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had horn rings, some drivers instinctively hit the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>center</b> in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic inhibitor switch activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening.|$|E
50|$|The most usual {{cause of}} damage is drag braking on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply {{directly}} on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the retaining ring will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the <b>wheel</b> <b>center,</b> maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the retaining ring down till it breaks, which could result in derailment.|$|E
5000|$|Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a {{fractured}} deltoid composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo {{first appeared on}} the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers {{came up with the}} meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck. As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering <b>wheel</b> <b>center</b> hubs and road wheel covers.|$|E

50|$|In 1952 Buick's mid-priced line {{resembled the}} Series 40 with three VentiPorts per fender and Sweepspear rocker panel trim. Super script {{appeared}} on the rear fenders aided identification. The Super was built with the larger C-body, however. The full flowing fenderline dipped deeper on this body and rear fenders had a rear crest line absent on the B-body Specials. A new deck lid gave a more squared off appearance. Like other Buick series it was a near copy year for 1952. Chromed rear fender fins gave distinction to 1952 Supers. Interiors were cloth except on convertibles and Estate wagons which were trimmed with leather. The Super used a different instrument panel than the Special. It was distinguished by a large center speedometer housing flanked by smaller gauge housings. Series identification was found within the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>center.</b> The Sedanet and the regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled. Sales fell to 135,332.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 Supers had larger bodies than Specials {{but looked}} similar with three rounded VentiPorts per fender, broad bright fender shields {{and a full}} length [...] "Sweepspear" [...] chrome body side molding. This {{chrome-plated}} strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in {{a quarter of a}} circle to go straight back to the taillight. Series script was found on the deck lid and within the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>center.</b> The long wheelbase sedan was named the Riviera sedan although it was not a hardtop. Supers were trimmed with materials similar to Special Deluxes except for in the plush Super Riviera sedan. Front turn signals were within the bumper guard [...] "bombs," [...] while rear signals shared the stop lamps' housing on the rear fender edges. The convertibles and Estate wagonwere trimmed in leather. 169,226 Supers were sold.|$|E
50|$|By {{moving the}} <b>wheel's</b> <b>center</b> of gravity forward, the wheel turns. Inside is a lead-weighted engine, which hangs by {{bearings}} off a stationary center shaft and uses its torque {{to move from}} 0 degrees vertical when stationary to 90 degrees forward at full blast, continually pulling itself forward around a sprocket bolted to the outer spokes. An independent counterweight system keeps the driver floating gently above ground out front, instead of inside the wheel, where most monowheel designs sequester him. Steering is handled by a gyro system and the driver's shifting weight.|$|R
