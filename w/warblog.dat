The impetus for the story grew out of the author's visual {{impressions}} of Lower Manhattan in winter, from which the character of Tito emerged. Little of the material in his original pitch of the novel (posted online as part of an early promotional campaign by the book's publishers) survived in the final draft. The original proposal focused on [...] "Warchalker", an obscure Iraqi <b>warblog</b> which chronicles the story of a disappeared consignment of millions of Iraqi reconstruction money. The readers of the blog included a female networks theorist interested in locative technology, and a Manhattanite of mixed heritage who freelanced with his family for organized crime. The plot would have followed those readers' attempt to track a shipping container through Warchalker on behalf of an unnamed villain.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>warblog</b> or milblog is a weblog devoted mostly or wholly to {{covering}} news events concerning {{an ongoing}} war. Sometimes {{the use of}} the term [...] "warblog" [...] implies that the blog concerned has a pro-war slant. [...] The term [...] "milblog" [...] implies that the author is with the military.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} coined on September 10, 1999 by Brad L. Graham, as a joke. It was re-coined in 2002 by William Quick, and was quickly adopted and {{propagated}} by the <b>warblog</b> community. The term resembles the older word logosphere (from Greek logos meaning word, and sphere, interpreted as world), [...] "the world of words", {{the universe of}} discourse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Warblogging</b> was {{popularized by}} Glenn Reynolds, whose Instapundit {{was one of}} the most popular {{political}} blogs on the web. [...] Some prominent <b>warblogs,</b> such as Little Green Footballs by Charles Johnson and Daily Dish by Andrew Sullivan existed before September 11, but made the war on terror their primary focus afterwards. Other notable <b>warblogs</b> included Dynamist by Virginia Postrel, KausFiles by Mickey Kaus, Talking Points Memo by Josh Marshall, KenLayne.com by Ken Layne, and Lileks.com by James Lileks.|$|R
5000|$|Most blogs that gained {{popularity}} as [...] "warblogs" [...] {{expanded their}} focus to politics and general news, usually from a right-of-center perspective, yet {{continued to be}} commonly known as <b>warblogs.</b> While <b>warblogs</b> arose {{in response to the}} post-September-11 wars and mostly limited their commentary to them, some moved on to related political, social and cultural issues and continued {{after the end of the}} wars.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{proposes to}} examine the {{emergent}} forms and practices of blogging as an augmentation of – and at times challenge to – war reporting. As will soon become apparent, however, we have not attempted {{the difficult task of}} comprehensively surveying the multiplicity of <b>warblogs</b> concerned with the invasion and its aftermath. Rather, we have chosen to investigate a small number, grouping them into three broad categories: <b>warblogs</b> associated with major news organizations; <b>warblogs</b> produced by freelance or ‘sojo’ reporters, as well as ‘personal’ or ‘amateur’ journalists; and <b>warblogs</b> posted by Iraqi citizens. In the course of our analysis, we draw upon insights provided by bloggers themselves, both from interviews conducted by ourselves as well as from other sources. We suggest that these writers valued the use of blogging as journalism – characterized as it is by informality, subjectivity and eyewitness experience – for the ways in which it cuts across the fundamentals of ostensibly impartial news reporting. In this chapter’s evaluation of warblogging’s relative strengths and limitations, then, care will be taken to discern {{the extent to which it}} represents a challenge to certain longstanding tenets of war reporting...|$|R
5000|$|The {{readership}} of warblogs {{dramatically increased}} in March 2003, following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with readers chiefly {{attracted by the}} offer of perspectives absent from most news reports; the pseudonymous Salam Pax, an Iraqi national posting first-hand accounts from Baghdad, emerged as a prominent war blogger. Media organisations that started their own reporters' <b>warblog</b> at this point included the BBC, the Christian Science Monitor, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. In {{the first half of}} 2003, CNN, The Hartford Courant, and Time were among the media organizations that prohibited staff reporters from covering US-led wars first-hand in their personal blogs for fear both of legal repercussions and of competition from such blogs.|$|E

After describing the basics of weblogging, the paper discusses Western media coverage of the war and then shows how 2 ̆ 7 warbloggers 2 ̆ 7 positioned themselves vis-à-vis media coverage and propaganda, creating commentaries that frequently combined media and political criticism. While bloggers of every political hue offered a range of perspectives and personal styles, some general tendencies are evident in <b>warblogging</b> discourse.

5000|$|The coinage 'warblog' is {{attributed}} to Matt Welch, who started his War Blog {{within days of the}} September 11 attacks. In the fall of 2001, the attacks gave rise to a [...] "war-blogging movement," [...] which favoured political punditry over the often personal and technological orientation that had dominated the blog genre up to that point, achieving much greater public and media recognition than earlier blogs. Most <b>warblogs</b> supported the US-led War in Afghanistan (2001-14) and the Iraq War (2003-11) from a hawkish perspective.|$|R
