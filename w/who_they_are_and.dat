5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same one back to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rest}} of the family gets used to their new home, Marge becomes homesick. Homer sneaks her back into Springfield one night under the {{disguise}} of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Marge is initially angry at the members of the mob, but she stuns them by saying that she does not want to live in Springfield or deal with them anymore, having found a place to live where she and her family can be accepted for <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> love each other without worry of hate and judgment from others. Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Bart discovers Lenny and Carl sneaking in. They tell the family they long to start a new life in The Outlands. Soon, Moe, Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which they name Springfield.|$|E

25|$|Walter is {{oblivious}} to the stark contrast between George and Joseph: his pursuit of wealth can only be attained by liberating himself from Joseph's culture, to which he attributes his poverty, and rising to George's level, wherein he sees his salvation. Walter redeems himself and black pride at the end by changing his mind and not accepting the buyout offer, stating that the family is proud of <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> will try to be good neighbors.

25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> how they should behave.|$|E
25|$|While {{planning}} {{what to do}} next, Banzai and the Cavaliers are met by John Parker (Carl Lumbly), {{a messenger}} from John Emdall (Rosalind Cash), {{the leader of the}} alien Black Lectroids of Planet 10, currently in Earth's orbit. Emdall explains that they have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, but had managed to banish them to the eighth dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' leader, John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen others to escape. Now that Banzai has perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids. Emdall had shocked Banzai previously to allow him to see the Lectroids for <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> now tasks him with stopping Whorfin or otherwise the Black Lectroids will fake a nuclear explosion to start World War III that will annihilate the Earth and the Red Lectroids with it. The Cavaliers track down the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey, finding that their arrival in 1938 was told by Orson Welles' broadcast of The War of the Worlds until the Lectroids forced him to admit it was a work of fiction. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the eighth dimension under the pretense of a new United States Air Force bomber.|$|E

It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels...

McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E

Rolling Stone staff writer Rob Sheffield gave Backspacer four out of five stars, saying that it contains [...] "the shortest, tightest, punkiest tunes they've ever banged out," [...] and that [...] "Eddie Vedder's heart-on-fire vocals are the main attraction, as always." [...] He added, [...] "After toughing out the Bush years, Pearl Jam aren't in the mood for brooding; at long last, surf's up." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian also gave the album four out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "the Seattle quartet have rarely sounded this energised." [...] Simpson observed that [...] "this is a record made by mature men with perspective: full of reflection and eclecticism, finding space for both U2 guitar motifs and Buzzcocks solos." [...] He added that [...] "the ninth Pearl Jam album may even be the best of the lot."
