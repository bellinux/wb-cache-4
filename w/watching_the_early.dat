At nine o'clock Walter Lodloe was on the forward upper deck, <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> passengers come on board, and occasionally smiling as his glance fell upon a tall man in a blue flannel shirt, who, with a number of other deck-hands, was hard at work transferring from the pier to the steamer the boxes, barrels, and bales of merchandise the discouraging mass of which was on the point of being increased by the unloading of a newly arrived two-horse truck.|$|E

It was a morning of silence, this--that peculiar, mysterious silence which only the first day of the week seems to bring. The fields were empty of toilers, the harvest was stayed. From its far-away nest amongst the hills, he could just hear, carried on the bosom of a favouring breeze, the single note of a monastery bell, whose harshness not even distance, or its pleasant journey across the open country, could modify. Macheson listened to it for a moment, and sat down upon a rock on the topmost pinnacle of the hills he was climbing.|$|E

50|$|Miles Christi was a name {{given to}} the members of the Iona Community by its founder George MacLeod. The origin of this image of being a Soldier for Christ may have its roots in Martin of Tours who as a former Roman soldier applied similar {{discipline}} to Christian life and was a great inspiration to <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Church in Scotland. St Martin's Cross, a high Celtic Cross carved in stone, stands to this day outside the entrance to the Church of Iona Abbey. The image also reflects a tradition of someone remaining on <b>watch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>early</b> Christian Community on Iona founded by St Columba sent members out to evangelise mainland Scotland and beyond, with some members remaining behind. George MacLeod had been a decorated soldier in the First World War. He founded the Iona Community just before the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a single}} television station’s choice of airing tune-ins (preview advertisements). I consider two consecutive programs located along a unit line. Poten-tial viewers know <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> program but are uncertain about the later one. The TV station may air a fully informative tune-in {{during the first}} program. The cost of the tune-in is the forgone advertising revenue. The viewers may learn the later program through a tune-in, if any, if they <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> program, or by directly sampling {{it for a few}} minutes. Under mild conditions, there exists a unique perfect Bayesian equi-librium in which some viewers <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> first program just {{to see if there is}} a tune-in or not, and the TV station airs a tune-in unless the two programs are too dissimilar. In the absence of a tune-in, no viewer within the first-period audience keeps watching TV. Full information disclosure never arises. The market outcome is suboptimal; a social planner would air a tune-in for a wider range of programs. When the programs are also quality-differentiated, the willingness to air a tune-in, and thus to disclose location information, may be sufficient to signal high quality without any dissipative advertising...|$|R

50|$|For the {{two years}} that {{followed}} The Bob Newhart Show, Daily returned to stand-up, but in 1980, after years {{of making a living}} as a second banana, Daily was offered his own show. Called Small & Frye, the show featured Daily as a neurotic doctor; it lasted only three months before being canceled. Daily, a lifelong lover of magic, made three syndicated specials introducing young magicians called Bill Daily's Hocus-Pocus Gang which aired in 1982 and 1983. In 1988, Daily tried his hand again at starring roles, this time as another doctor on the sitcom Starting From Scratch. It fared slightly better than Frye, and was canceled after one season. Daily's most notable post-Newhart role was another supporting character, that of Larry the psychiatrist on the cult favorite ALF (1986); Jack Riley appeared as an unnamed patient, clearly reprising Elliot Carlin from The Bob Newhart Show. ALF claimed to have learned all he knew about psychology from <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> series.|$|R

Savers was the first Digimon series to be produced in nearly four years, but the second Digimon production since 2005, coming off the heels of Digital Monster X-Evolution, where staff had mentioned early on that a new series might be possible depending on its performance. Unlike previous series which all featured human character designs by Akihiro Asanuma, Savers went with designs by Sayo Aoi that featured designs more typical of anime than the staple style of shows past. The series was aired as a family program rather than a children's program {{in an attempt to}} capture a wider audience, including those who might have <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> shows but grown older.
