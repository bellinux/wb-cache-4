6000|$|I {{notice that}} it is {{customary}} for the daily papers to publish a column or so of society gossip. They generally head it [...] "Chit-Chat," [...] or [...] "On Dit," [...] or [...] "Le Boudoir," [...] or something of the sort, and they keep it pretty full of French terms {{to give it the}} proper sort of swing. These columns may be very interesting in their way, but it always seems to me that they don't get hold of quite the right things to tell us about. They are very fond, for instance, of giving an account of the delightful dance at Mrs. De Smythe's--at which Mrs. De Smythe looked charming in a gown of old tulle with a stomacher of passementerie--or of the dinner-party at Mr. Alonzo Robinson's residence, or the smart pink tea given by Miss Carlotta Jones. No, that's all right, but it's {{not the kind of thing}} we want to get at; those are not the events which happen in our neighbours' houses that we really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> is the quiet little family scenes, the little traits of home-life that--well, for example, take the case of that delightful party at the De Smythes. I am certain that all those who were present would much prefer a little paragraph like the following, which would give them some idea of the home-life of the De Smythes on the morning after the party.|$|E

The organization also recognized Rosewood residents who protected blacks during the attacks by presenting an Unsung Heroes Award to the descendants of Sheriff Robert Walker, John Bryce, and William Bryce.

Since you are reading the abstract, that means one of two things, either you want to see what is ahead, to gain some overall perspective before delving int 6 the meat of the report, or. more likely you want a condensed version of the material of the report so you don't have to read all the text that you saw while flipping through on your initial glance. For those of you who read no text past this abstract. you are probably like me, and have come to expect a bunch of mindless dribble that is used to fill space on a page and make the author look like they know what the hell they're talking about when they really don't. As the deadline nears for this project I'm sure that my inability to get things done will result in some of this extraneous text that I mentioned just a moment ago appearing throughout various portions of this thesis book. But I do believe there is a certain segment of this book, and my project, which provides some genuine insight into the nature of architectural expression. It deals with the design of a stage set for a production at Muncie Civic Theatre. Approximately 2. 400 people viewed the project over the run of the show. Very few of those people will ever see this book, or realize some of the deeper issues which my project has addressed, in fact many of the issues that I address within this report deal with situations and experiences revealed well after the date the set was actually "finished" from the audiences standpoint. Such it is with architecture [...] . the true essence of your design comes to life after the time that we as a profession deem the project "past the point of substantial completion. " In actuality this point marks the birth of your creation and the subsequent use of your design is when the magic takes place. This is a story about people interacting with spaces [...] . Architecture is dependent upon people, and must ultimately be judged by its impact upon our lives. So please take a few minutes to share in the experiences that I have nicely condensed into this book for you to contemplate. This whole book is an abstract for a semester in the life of an architecture student coming to grips with the world of design. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|E
40|$|Each {{individual}} is called by nature {{to come into}} contact with the end; this inevitable bond has always brought people to put in place a series of collective attitudes and behaviors in order to act before death. In contemporary society human being, taken from the hustle and bustle of work and constantly engaged in pursuing material well-being, doesn’t take time to think about death. Not only he personally distances himself from death but he also doesn’t even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But even if confined and avoided, death rises everywhere and always shows itself in all its dramatic relentlessness. Contemporary society is inclined towards a purely rational thought which tries to give an explanation to everything around us and rejects the possibility {{of not being able to}} have an answer to all the questions. In this context death becomes a taboo. The life-death dichotomy that characterizes the Western way of thinking inspires fear and worsens anxiety for an event which undeniably will hit everyone. This climate doesn’t help people. Especially in adolescence it is difficult to accept the death of the Other as a possible condition and it is rather seen as something to dismiss from our minds. Denouncing this taboo means to give breath to pain, to give it a meaning and to allow adolescents not only to express their fears, but also to give voice to their ability to go trough life. This experimental research is aimed at teenagers attending different high schools in the city of Brescia. The TDRS scale (Testoni Death Representation Scale) was used to assess the representation of death, the presence of alexithymia was investigated with the TAS- 20, the Collett-Lester fear of death was used to detect anxiety that emerges in relation to the thought of death and finally the WHOQOL-SRPB questionnaire was used to investigate the satisfaction of quality of life in relation to the presence of a spiritual dimension. In order to obtain informations to confirm the quantitative data, it was decided to carry out a qualitative analysis through the Atlas. ti software, analyzing the material produced by the teenagers during the Death Education path and a final question in which they had to express what it meant for them. The sample consists of 315 students between 16 and 19 years old, divided into experimental (143) and control group (172). The obtained data indicate that a path of Death Education is useful to act on death representation directing it towards a vision of transition, while the qualitative analysis shows greater awareness on the theme of death and loss. In addition, a similar educational path has been proved effective to decrease anxiety that emerges in relation to the theme of Finiteness and at the same time it improved the difficulty of identifying and describing emotions as well as of communicating them to others. These data are confirmed by qualitative analysis which shows that at the beginning of the path the emotions expressed were mainly negative, towards the conclusion there was a prevalence of positive emotions. Emotional activation, within this context, shows itself in a variety of facets that are in a continuum where on one hand there are anger and pain and, on the other, there are hope and joy. With regard to spirituality an increase of hope, which affects the perception of their quality of life, is detected. These data support the conclusion that an intervention of Death Education is effective and important because it encourages reflections on death, but also on life and its value. Moreover it allows people to express their feelings and fears, putting them in a frame of meaning. In addition Death Education encourages every person to increase his own spiritual dimension which helps to take awareness on what it means to live knowing that we will die. Creating a context in which it is possible to speak of death allows people to become aware about the finiteness of life, giving them the means to face the fear of death, fear that is listened to, accepted and reworked...|$|E
