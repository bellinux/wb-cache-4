6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> easily enough," [...] {{answered}} Fred. [...] "We {{hardly ever}} {{have a chance to}} wear anything these days but our uniforms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> I {{should not}} mind," [...] Hilda said; [...] "but even the {{possibility}} of Walter being buried {{by the man who}} we firmly believe was the cause of his death is terrible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{she finds}} {{how much we}} know, and how we know it,' he said, 'and that she is clearly {{compromised}} already, we are not without strong hopes {{that we may be}} enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> she might go scot-free for aught I cared.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. They wouldn't {{have thought}} of it, if it hadn't been for us," [...] chortled O'Hara. [...] "I wonder, now, if there's {{anything}} else <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to <b>that</b> statue!" [...] he added, meditatively.|$|R
6000|$|... "We needn't start without capital neither," [...] said Grubb. [...] "If we {{take the}} best of these {{machines}} up to the Bicycle Mart in Finsbury we'd raise six or seven pounds on 'em. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> easy <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to-morrow before anybody much was about...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> Lily. <b>We</b> {{must choose}} for {{ourselves}} a smaller house than this, {{and one that}} is not burdened with the expense of a garden. Even if we paid but a moderate rent for this place, we should not have the means of living here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{orders were}} to go to Sudbury, and I think we'd better keep on in that direction, rather than lose time by {{carrying}} you to Ticonderoga. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> last if we pleased, for our boat is hidden among the bushes nearabout where Master Jones turned back. What say you, Isaac Rice? Is it to be Sudbury, or the fort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{we could}} act at once. I should {{run up to}} town, lay the case before the {{authorities}} at Scotland Yard, {{and get them to}} telegraph to every port in the kingdom, that upon her putting in there the vessel was at once to be searched for two ladies who were believed to have been forcibly carried away in her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There doesn’t {{seem much}} chance here, Nixon. I {{think we had}} best {{get out of the}} wood and follow the edge along. We may come to some place where it is more open, and may even strike on a stream. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> we might patch up the boat and pull up stream a bit. Anyhow, I don’t think it is any use pushing on here. My jacket is torn in a dozen places already by the thorns.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not worth}} {{thinking}} about, Walter. We are heavily your debtors, still, for the kindness of your father and yourself to me at Derry, and indeed on all other occasions. Besides, it was the least <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> seeing <b>that</b> it was my grandfather's hatred of your family which brought the matter about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So we will," [...] laughed McCoy in gruff tones, [...] "and it's my {{notion that}} there's a natural barrier round that island which will go further to defend us agin the King's ships than {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Isn't <b>that</b> white {{line at the}} foot o' the cliffs like a heavy surf, boys?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It was in 1916 that cocaine {{began to}} make its first {{appearance}} in Cairo, to be followed later by the pleasanter and more potent heroin, {{but there was little}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> at <b>that</b> time when trafficking or possession was a mere contravention with a maximum penalty of £EI fine or a week's imprisonment. p.223 ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{took the}} book from Erlcort's hand and {{examined}} the outside of it curiously if not critically. Then he looked from it to Erlcort, and said, [...] "Oh, {{how do you do}} again! Well, no, sir; I don't know as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> You see, you would have to read it to find out that you didn't want it, and that would be like using or wearing an article, wouldn't it? We couldn't take back a thing that had been used or worn--heigh?" ...|$|E
60|$|All <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> day was to {{make one}} more attempt to {{communicate}} with the unhappy madman. Again he was visible on his perch; again he fled in silence. But food and a great cloak were at least left for his comfort; the rain, besides, had cleared away, and the night promised to be even warm. We might compose ourselves, we thought, until the morrow; rest was the chief requisite, that we might be strengthened for unusual exertions; and as none cared to talk, we separated at an early hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without noise," [...] Ned replied. [...] "At any rate {{it would be}} very {{dangerous}} while their ship is lying so close. I should say the best plan will be to wait, as you say, till the Spaniards have settled themselves comfortably, then to haul up to her and push the boat along by her side, fending her off carefully so as to make no noise until we reach the bow, then we can cut the cable and let her drift. The tide is running strong now, and in half an hour she will be over a mile down the river, {{and there will be no}} fear of a shout being heard on board the ship, and we can then board her and tackle the Spaniards." ...|$|E
5000|$|Around 1942, Göring's art agent Sepp Angerer, and {{the local}} German consul Gerhard Wolf, went {{on a tour of}} Contini-Bonacossi's collection. Angerer {{supposedly}} told the count, [...] "What a pity you're not a Jew!" [...] and drawing a finger across his throat continued [...] "If you were a Jew, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> just <b>that!</b> And all the paintings would be ours!" ...|$|R
500|$|Oxford's Foord-Weston {{said the}} {{conditions}} were [...] "pretty grim" [...] but their training at Dorney {{during the week}} running up to the race had prepared them for the [...] "horrible winds". [...] Cambridge's number seven, Emily Day, said [...] "it was pretty windy ... we had the race of our lives ... there's nothing <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't do." ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{consider}} our {{label to}} be a [...] "cream of the crop" [...] label. There {{are plenty of}} albums <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>that's</b> not what we are about as a company. We clean out all the bad stuff. We were like, ok, let's not be completists. If you're going to own {{a record of the}} soul Deep City label, own our record. There are no duds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Luka, {{we are at}} {{the mouth}} of the Gulf of Obi. It is nearly two hundred miles, {{according}} to this map, to the opposite side, and we daren't try to make that; besides, the wind has been getting more to the west and would be right in our teeth, for you see by this tracing the opposite point of land is a good bit to the south of west. There is nothing for it but for us to keep along this shore for something like a hundred and fifty miles. We can lay our course well with this wind. The gulf won't be more than eighty miles wide there, and we can strike across and coast down the opposite bank. It seems a long way round, but we shall do it as quickly as we should beating right across in the teeth of this wind. I doubt if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> at all with this craft behind us." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I went to bed, and, and I {{literally}} {{was in bed}} {{thinking of}} all these records that I {{had in my life}} ... I was going through the library mentally thinking, what song would she never have done that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was just a great song. And one of my favorite songs was Chairman of the Board's 'Give Me Just a Little More Time.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Blade Runner {{might not}} have done well financially when it first came out, but people are still talking about {{it because it was}} infused with all these big ideas. Scott was also talking about very big themes in Prometheus. It was being driven by people who wanted the answers to huge questions. But I thought that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> without ever getting too pretentious. Nobody wants to see a movie where people are {{floating}} in space talking about the meaning of life ... That was already present in Spaihts's original script and Scott just wanted to bring it up more.|$|E
5000|$|On the September 11 attacks: [...] "I'm really {{jealous of}} {{happened}} in New York. Those types of actions, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But me, I {{was thinking about}} tank trucks. Apparently even Bin Laden has thought about that. Blowing up tank trucks is way easier than hijacking planes. It could happen in Toronto or it could happen in the West Island of Montreal where {{there are a lot}} of Canadians." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "On {{the night}} before the assault, Strahorn did not even attempt to sleep. Thorough the night he and others {{alternatively}} sat and stood, holding their horses in the cold rain and mist. [...] "Never before or since," [...] he wrote in later years, [...] "were hours so laggard or anxiety so great for the coming of dawn when <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something <b>that</b> would heat the blood and cheer the soul to the forgetfulness of that everlasting soaking patter, patter of freezing rain." ...|$|R
2500|$|... was {{a fantastic}} {{place in the}} middle of nowhere with no {{facilities}} at all--and it was a fantastic test of what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in <b>that</b> environment. Because by that time we'd become obsessed with change, and the great thing was that we were also able to create a pastoral side of Led Zep. Jimmy was listening to Davey Graham and Bert Jansch and was experimenting with different tunings, and I loved John Fahey. So it was a very natural place for us to go to.|$|R
5000|$|Waterman stated: [...] "I went to bed, and, and I {{literally}} {{was in bed}} {{thinking of}} all these records that I {{had in my life}} ... I was going through the library mentally thinking, what song would she never have done that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> was just a great song. And one of my favorite songs was Chairman of the Board's 'Give Me Just a Little More Time.'" [...] He was working {{in the middle of the}} night when he ran downstairs to his record label to find the track. The song was played to Minogue the next morning.|$|E
5000|$|Dynasty {{cancellation}} in 1989 {{had left}} its ninth season finale unresolved and characters in mortal peril; original cast member John Forsythe later noted, [...] "The {{way we were}} cut off was a disgrace." [...] Executive Producer Aaron Spelling said during production of Dynasty: The Reunion that [...] "Beethoven can leave a symphony unfinished ... We didn't think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with a soap opera." [...] Eager to give the series proper closure, the cast agreed to come back [...] "at slightly reduced salaries" [...] and production relied on location shoots rather than the expensive sets of its heyday. [...] "We are still groomed, groomed {{within an inch of}} our lives," [...] noted star Joan Collins, who with onscreen rival Linda Evans had 42 costumes between them in the miniseries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day, {{the then}} Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi issued an official directive on the matter, affirming that MPs could only vote along party lines. Zaid {{and most of}} the other backbenchers who had backed further autonomy told the press they accepted the decision. However, Rosli clashed with Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliamentary Affairs and Deputy Chief Whip Nazri Aziz, who said that [...] "The Whip is only relaxed when it is lifted by the chief or the deputy chief Whip." [...] Rosli said [...] "...in the absence of his Chief Whip's direction, the general rule is to that MPs are to vote according to their conscience..." [...] Although many backbenchers said they considered Shahrir the BNBBC chairman, Abdullah said that the government had planned to sack Shahrir, [...] "But before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> he resigned, and we respect his decision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir--exceedingly liberal--liberal as {{the rosy}} dawn. Why, sir, meeting your {{proposition}} {{in the spirit}} {{in which it is}} offered, I should say Julia and I could get along very comfortably on $100,000. Yes, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make <b>that</b> <b>do,</b> provided the money were well invested--no fancy stocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for <b>that</b> capital old Professor. Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die {{out there in}} Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" [...] said Laurie, when they began to pace {{up and down the}} long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.|$|R
6000|$|Look {{not every}} {{man on his}} own things, but every man also on the things of others. Ah, my friends, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>do</b> <b>that</b> heartily and always, what a {{different}} world it would be, and what different people we should be! If, instead of saying to ourselves, as one is so apt to do, 'Will this suit my interest? will this help me?' we would recollect to say too, 'Will this suit my neighbours' interest? Will this harm my neighbours, though it may help me? For if it hurts them, I will {{have nothing to do}} with it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Core members Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow {{began writing}} songs {{together}} in late 1986 while Ken {{was in school}} at the University of Washington. Auer later recalled {{in an interview that}} [...] "we first met at a Dan Reed Network show; we were united in feeling <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> stuff much better ourselves, the two of us". Their first public performance came as an acoustic duo that next summer while Ken was home in Bellingham.During the last part of 1987 and the first two months of 1988, Ken drove home on weekends to join Jon as they recorded twelve songs in Jon's family's home studio. Though intended as demos to attract other members and form a full band, the recordings turned out so well that they became the Posies' first self-released album, Failure. Interest in the Posies rose out of the numerous home-copied cassettes that began to spread around Seattle and Bellingham.|$|E
5000|$|As a Christian, he {{believes}} that pornography is a sin against God and nature. However, he stated “One {{of the things that}} I like to tell people who are struggling with an addiction to pornography, or just about any other thing in their life, is that it’s really true that there’s nothing you could do that would change the fact that God loves you and wants to redeem you...It’s kind of like a parent who is watching their toddler learn to walk. And the toddler might fall down several times a day, but there’s never a good parent that ever says, ‘this walking thing isn’t for you. You should probably stay down there on the floor.’ But yet, some of us want to think that God’s that way and that our sin separates us from Him to such an extreme that He would never redeem us. But that’s not true. There’s nothing that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> would change the fact that when we turn to Him, and we ask Him to help us stand back up, He’s right there, willing to pick us up.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 {{as part of}} {{a wide-ranging}} {{interview}} with Channel 4 News, McEwan reflected upon the furore that surrounded his remarks on Islamism in 2008, stating [...] "I remember getting a lot of stick five or six years ago saying something disobliging about jihadists. There were voices, particularly on the left, that thought anyone who criticised Islamism was really criticising Islam and therefore racist. Well, those voices have gone quiet because the local atrocities committed by Islamists whether in Pakistan or Mali is so self-evidently vile." [...] In the same interview, McEwan remarked that he felt that protestors of the 2003 Iraq War were [...] "vindicated" [...] by what happened subsequently; argued that the chief legacy of the Iraq War was that [...] "... sometimes there are things <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> war which we no longer can" [...] in foreign affairs; stated that at one point prior to the 2003 invasion he had hoped to be able to seek an audience with Tony Blair to persuade him not {{to go ahead with the}} war; and as someone who voted for the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 UK general election, that the current coalition government of the United Kingdom should end, stating [...] "Let's either have a Tory government or let Ed Miliband try something different," [...] to try and turn around a country of [...] "great inequity". McEwan is traditionally a Labour supporter and said he had his [...] "fingers crossed" [...] that Miliband would become Prime Minister.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go at once," [...] said Dias, [...] "and {{examine the}} river higher up. If I {{can find no}} place where the mules can climb, I am sure {{to be able to}} find some spot where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so. But <b>that</b> would mean the failure of our expedition, for <b>we</b> {{certainly}} <b>could</b> not go up the mountains, purchase fresh animals, food, and tools, and get down to the place we are looking for until too late." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, the {{remaining}} members of INXS - Andrew Farriss, Garry Gary Beers, Tim Farriss, Kirk Pengilly, and Jon Farriss - {{joined forces with}} Mark Burnett to be the subjects of the first series of Rock Star; Rock Star: INXS. Tim Farriss told Entertainment Weekly [...] "after Michael died, we wanted to search {{the world for a}} new singer but didn't know how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> effectively <b>do</b> <b>that</b> ... By having Mark ... embrace the concept, we've now found a fantastic way to make that happen." [...] J.D. Fortune, a one-time homeless former Elvis impersonator, ultimately won the competition, with Tim Farriss declaring the band chose him because of his [...] "slightly dangerous edge" [...] and [...] "star quality".|$|R
50|$|But oh, if only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> Hernani instead <b>that</b> {{would be}} tremendous. I {{know that it}} would mean {{a great deal of}} trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and {{compensate}} him........ all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and its all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow Ill write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from Hernani which seem to me suitable.|$|R
