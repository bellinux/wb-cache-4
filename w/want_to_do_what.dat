However, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now that we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> good is the power? Let's test {{it and try to}} get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

[...] The children are free {{to choose their own}} professions, Wallenda says. [...] Evita {{is said to be the}} most interested in following in her father's footsteps.

2500|$|On November 11, 2009, Seattle Children's Hospital {{became the}} first major children's {{hospital}} to host a pediatrician-authored blog. Swanson, {{now known as the}} [...] "Seattle Mama Doc," [...] wanted the blog to be an online science-based resource for parents. In her blog posts, Swanson offers general health and safety tips, discusses issues in the media like HPV, vaccinations, sudden infant death syndrome, car seats, and trends in breast-feeding, and shares her own experiences as a parent. [...] "The abundance of online noise invokes fear in all of us when making decisions for our children," [...] said Swanson.

2500|$|In the story, Lucky {{comes across}} Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) after {{she has been}} raped, and confides his upset to his father before his hostile {{half-brother}} Nikolas Cassadine (then Christopher) reveals to him that Luke had raped Laura years prior. The betrayal Lucky feels from having the truth kept from him has a drastic impact on the character, especially because of how close he had been with his parents. Having moved around often, their relationship had become more like best friends than parent-child. Lucky struggles to understand his parents' actions. Jackson described Lucky in 1999 as: [...] "a black-and-white personality. He either loves or hates people. He doesn't know about balance." [...] Lucky's relationship with each of his parents suffers; he thinks his mother is in denial about her attack, and is even more angry with his father for keeping the secret while Lucky was coping with Elizabeth's assault. Lucky moves out and his independence grows further as he crashes at various places around Port Charles while holding odd jobs and continuing his schoolwork. As {{a result of the}} ordeal, honesty becomes important to Lucky; Jackson explained to Soap Opera Digest in December 1998: [...] "He doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> his parents did as far as keeping secrets from each other and lying. He's pretty set on doing things differently {{when it comes to the}} decisions he makes in his life." ...|$|E
