5|$|Scheduling {{was left}} up to each team. There were wide variations, both in {{the overall number of}} games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings <b>were</b> <b>maintained.</b> In addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league. For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England in the 11th century a motte and bailey castle was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} side of the city, but the Norman rulers continued to use the older burh walls, despite the city having expanded beyond these defences in the north and south-east. During the years of the Anarchy in the 1140s, Worcester was successfully attacked several times; after the war a new city wall was built to improve the city's defences. The new walls, completed by the early 13th century, were constructed of stone and had three main gates. They <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> in good condition into the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Colonization and {{expansion}} {{of the kingdom of}} Nri was achieved by sending mbùríchi, or converts, to other settlements. Allegiance to the eze Nri was obtained not by military force but through ritual oath. Religious authority was vested in the local king, and ties <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> by traveling mbùríchi. By the 14th century, Nri influence extended well beyond the nuclear northern Igbo region to Igbo settlements on {{the west bank of the}} Niger and communities affected by the Benin Empire. There is strong evidence to indicate Nri influence well beyond the Igbo region to Benin and Southern Igala areas like Idah. At its height, the kingdom of Nri had influence over roughly a third of Igboland and beyond. It reached its furthest extent between 1100 and 1400.|$|E
5|$|Early on October 22, both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Brisbane {{started to}} issue special {{advisories}} {{to support the}} meteorological services of Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in tracking the cyclone. As Xavier was over the islands of Santa Cruz the whole of Temotu Province was placed under a tropical cyclone gale warning, while cyclone watches were declared for Rennel, Bellona, and Vanuatu. During the next 24 hours, the Torres and Banks Islands, as well as Espirito Santo, Maewo, Ambae, were placed under a cyclone warning. The warnings for the Solomon Islands were then cancelled early the next day, while the warnings for Vanuatu <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> until late on October 25, when RSMC Nadi discontinued them.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's disloyalty {{led to the}} Crown {{seizing the}} castle again and taking on the burden of {{repairing}} and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and keep up sections of the palisades.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, the {{industrialist}} Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle, {{going on}} to purchase it outright in 1844, and established a walled kitchen garden known as Castle Gardens to the south-west of the main castle. It {{was used as a}} vicarage from 1825 onwards, including by Archdeacon William Bevan. The terraced gardens <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> during the 19th century, with various trees planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s, and a stable block was built within the grounds.|$|E
5|$|In late September {{and early}} October 1991, the {{blockade}} of JNA barracks {{in and around}} Karlovac and Croatian defences in the city <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> by about 900 police and ZNG troops. The troops {{were assigned to the}} 110th Infantry Brigade and the under-strength 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The 110th Infantry Brigade, at one-third of its planned strength due to poor organisation and a shortage of weapons, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf Brlečić.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{obtained}} IRO {{membership in}} secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal {{oath of allegiance}} over the Gospel or a Christian cross, a gun and a knife; treason was punishable by death, and secret police monitored each member's activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, relations <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> with the revolutionary diasporic community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E
5|$|Most {{roads in}} the Lowlands <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> by justices from a {{monetary}} levy on landholders and work levy on tenants. The development of national grain prices indicates the network had improved considerably by the early eighteenth century. By {{the end of the}} seventeenth century, the drover's roads, stretching down from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England and used for the transport of Highland Cattle for the English meat market, had become firmly established. In the Highlands and Galloway in the early eighteenth century, a series of military roads were built and maintained by the central government, with the aim of facilitating the movement of troops in the event of rebellion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E

5|$|Several signal {{events from}} the 4th to 6th centuries mark {{the period of}} {{transition}} during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions <b>were</b> <b>maintained,</b> modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps <b>were</b> <b>maintained</b> in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
