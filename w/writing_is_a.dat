Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language. At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.|$|E

25|$|<b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{medium of}} human {{communication}} that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complement to speech or spoken language. Writing {{is not a}} language, but a tool used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies {{on many of the}} same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the written word has {{recently}} evolved to include an informal, colloquial written style, in which an everyday conversation can occur through writing rather than speaking.

25|$|While neolithic <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> current {{research}} topic, conventional history {{assumes that the}} writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East.

Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.|$|E

Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (and the teachers, classroom helpers, or prospective teachers they are writing with) increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn to express themselves for an audience, and experience an atmosphere of openness and expression. Students also develop writing fluency over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E
500|$|Voices {{examines}} {{the cultural and}} religious strife between the monotheistic beliefs of the Alds and the polytheistic practices {{of the citizens of}} Ansul. Described as a [...] "plea for cultural relativity", the novel also juxtaposes violent and non-violent means of ending a conflict. As with the other stories of Annals of the Western Shore, Voices examines enslavement and the treatment of women, and the theme of justice. The story traces Memer's coming of age, and the power of words, stories, and <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> recurring theme. The book received acclaim from critics, who praised its nuanced portrayal of religion and cultural conflict, the characterization of Memer, and Le Guin's writing and detailed world building. Multiple reviewers compared it to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, also prominently featuring the destruction of books. Voices was a finalist for a Locus Award in 2007.

She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work."

2500|$|Asemic <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wordless open {{semantic}} form of writing. The word asemic means [...] "having {{no specific}} semantic content," [...] or [...] "without the smallest unit of meaning." [...] With the non-specificity of asemic writing {{there comes a}} vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of {{this is similar to}} the way one would deduce meaning from an abstract work of art. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hybrid art form that fuses text and image into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to free writing or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be [...] "read" [...] in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to translate and explore an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the inter{{generation}}al {{trauma that}} is {{passed down from}} each {{generation to the next}} due to the violent colonization, healing is an important aspect of resistance. Healing practices include doing work that reverts to the pre-colonized cultural traditional Indigenous work such as weaving, sewing, music, or even active participation in Indigenous community. Along with this, reclaiming sovereignty through storytelling and writing are also forms of Indigenous activism. <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> particularly useful tool in healing and activism. It serves as both, [...] "means of surviving oppression and a way to engage in the healing process." [...] The book This Bridge Called My Back, Writings by Radical Women of Color makes this idea a reality, by publishing the honest and creative narratives about Native and Indigenous feminism, and contextualizing these pieces as academia. Chrystos, an Indigenous feminist writer and poet practices writing as resistance in Not Vanishing in which Chrystos theorizes about her experiences as an Indigenous woman in white feminist spaces.|$|E
2500|$|Canonic <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{particularly}} {{important feature of}} La Rue's style, {{and he has been}} particularly celebrated for this. He liked to write canons of considerable complexity, rather than restricting himself to simple imitation. The second of his two masses based on the L'homme armé tune begins and ends with mensuration canons, canons in which all the voices sing the same material, but at different speeds; this is yet another feat of contrapuntal virtuosity worthy of Josquin or Ockeghem; indeed La Rue sometimes seemed to be in conscious competition with the more renowned Josquin. The closing Agnus Dei of this mass is the only known mensuration canon of the entire era for four voices, with all four voices singing the same tune. [...] La Rue wrote six pieces that are completely canonic from start to finish, including two masses, three motets, and a chanson; and he wrote three more masses, two motets, and three chansons which are based on canon but contain some free sections; and there are numerous other works which include canonic sections. [...] In his use of canons, he may have been influenced by Matthaeus Pipelare, who wrote an early canonic mass La Rue almost certainly knew, since {{it was part of the}} repertory of the Habsburg court chapel.|$|E
