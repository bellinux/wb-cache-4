50|$|The {{first trial}} of a Davy lamp with a <b>wire</b> <b>sieve</b> was at Hebburn Colliery on 9 January 1816. A letter from Davy (which he {{intended}} to be kept private) describing his findings and various suggestions for a safety lamp was made public {{at a meeting in}} Newcastle on 3 November 1815, and a paper describing the lamp was formally presented at a Royal Society meeting in London on 9 November. For it, Davy was awarded the Society's Rumford Medal. Davy's lamp differed from Stephenson's in that the flame was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder (a design mentioned in Davy's Royal Society paper as an alternative to his preferred solution). For his invention Davy was given £2,000 worth of silver (the money being raised by public subscription), whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy, because the fully developed 'Geordie lamp' had not been demonstrated by Stephenson until after Davy had presented his paper at the Royal Society and (it was held) previous versions had not actually been safe.|$|E

Phytochemical screening confirmed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, lipids, tannins, flavonoids, and steroids. A reduction in nutrient contents was also observed in infested melon seeds.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{long-term}} operation of a full-scale municipal membrane bioreactor, focusing mainly on the membrane section. The ultrafiltration chamber, equipped with 12 130 m 2 of submerged hollow-fiber membranes, was installed after an existing alternating oxic/anoxic bioreactor. Attention is paid {{to a number of}} practical details, from the effectiveness of different sieves to the impact of the operating parameters on the membrane performances; finally, data of the energy consumptions and items of the operating costs are presented. Starting from the pretreatments, while the wedge <b>wire</b> <b>sieve</b> (openings) 1 mm) involved the visible accumulation of fibers and trash in the filtration chamber, the punched holes (holes diameter) 1. 5 mm) involved less than 100 milligrams of dry trash per liter of mixed liquor, demonstrating that they suited the following membrane system. Moving on to the off-line equalization basin, a volume of one-fifth of the bioreactor was sufficient to cope with the normal fluctuations of the municipal inloadings. As for the membrane section, a net flux of 26 LMH and chemical maintenance cleaning in place once a week with only hypochlorite (around 300 mgCl L- 1) was a sustainable practice to keep the long-term permeability (adjusted at 20 °C) stable in the range 220 - 240 LMH bar- 1. Under this operating protocol, increases of specific aeration for membrane scouring from 0. 12 to 0. 19 Nm 3 m- 2 h- 1 did not lead to permeability gains that might justify the increased power requirements. This evidence allows us to conclude that 0. 12 Nm 3 m- 2 h- 1 was sustainable for the normal operation of the hollow-fiber membranes. Irreversible membrane fouling (permeability decrease up to 150 - 160 LMH bar- 1) was observed because of irregular discharges of municipal landfill leachate, which, from one side, caused a drastic deflocculation of the activated sludge (sludge volume index (SVI) increased from 110 up to 250 mL gMLSS) and, from the other side, involved a probable incoming of recalcitrant compounds that might have acted as foulants. The power requirements of the whole treatment facility were always lower than 0. 6 kWh m- 3 thanks to the general good utilization of the air supplied. The specific operating costs related to the energy consumptions and chemicals purchase were in the range 0. 06 - 0. 08 euro m- 3...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Pollution of {{soil and}} water {{environment}} by release of heavy metals is of great concerns of the last decades. Sorption of heavy metals by low cost materials is considered as an inexpensive and efficient method used for removal of heavy metals from soil-water systems. The presence of different ligands with various complexing abilities can change the sorption properties of heavy metals and their fate in the environment as well. In order to assess the effect of citrate and arginine as natural organic ligands in soil environment, in a batch study we investigated {{the effects of these}} ligands on equilibrium sorption of nickel to sepiolite and calcite minerals and also kinetics of Ni sorption by these minerals. Materials and Methods: Minerals used in this study included sepiolite from Yazd (Iran) and pure calcite (Analytical grade, Merck, Germany). Sepiolite was purified, saturated with Ca using 0. 5 M CaCl 2, powdered in a mortar and sieved by non-metal 230 mesh standard <b>wire</b> <b>sieve.</b> For equilibrium sorption study, in a 50 -mL polyethylene centrifuge tube, 0. 3 g sample of each mineral was suspended in 30 mL of a 0. 01 M CaCl 2 solution containing 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mg L- 1 Ni (NiCl 2) and containing zero (as control) or 0. 1 mmol L- 1 citrate or arginine ligands. The applied concentrationsfor each ligand can naturally occur in soils. Preparedtubes were shaken (180 ± 2 rpm, 25 ± 1 oC) for 24 h using an orbital shaker and centrifuged (4000 ×g for 10 min) and the supernatants were analyzed for Ni concentration using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAnalyst 200 Perkin-Elmer) at a wavelength of 232 nm and a detection limit of 0. 05 mg L- 1. The quantity of Ni retained by each mineral at equilibrium was calculated using equation qe = (Ci - Ce) V/W where qe was the amount of nickel retained by mineral surface at equilibrium. Ci and Ce were the initial and the equilibrium concentrations (mg L- 1) of Ni, respectively, V was the volume (L) of the solution, and W was the mass (g) of the sorbent. The Langmuir, Freundlich and linear isotherm models were fitted to sorption data using Graphpad prism 5. 0. For kinetic study, 30 mL of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 solution, with or without 0. 1 mM citrate or arginine, containing Ni at a concentration corresponding to the maximum sorption capacity of each mineral (estimated from sorption isotherms) were transferred into 50 -ml polyethylene centrifuge tubes containing 0. 3 g of sepiolite or calcite. The suspensions were shaken (180 ± 2 rpm, 25 °C) continuously and after 0. 5, 1. 5, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours, corresponding tubes were centrifuged (4000 ×g for 10 min) and supernatants were analyzed for Ni concentration by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Using Graphpad prism 5. 0, kinetic data were fitted to Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and power function kinetic models. Results: With or without ligands, the Langmuir model was the best description of Ni sorption to sepiolite while the linear model was the best fit of calcite data showing the physical nature of Ni sorption by this mineral. Kinetics of Ni sorption to sepiolite and calcite were best described by power function model. In the presence of citrate, both capacity and rate of sorption of Ni to sepiolite decreased. There was no considerable change in sorption of Ni to calcite. In the presence of arginine, however, sorption capacity of minerals for Ni increased. Arginine enhanced the rate of Ni sorption on all three minerals. Citrate showed opposing effects on Ni sorption kinetics depending on the studied minerals. Totally, citrate and arginine had opposite effects on sorption of Ni to sepiolite and calcite. Conclusion: Organic ligands can change sorption characteristics of the minerals. It seems that citrate decreases sorption of Ni to sepiolite but its effect on Ni sorption to calcite is negligible, while arginine increases Ni sorption to both minerals. Our results suggested that presence of citrate and arginine in soil influence Ni sorption by soil minerals. As in warmer seasons of year,microbial activities due to optimum temperature and moisture result in production of citrate and argininewhich facilitate and suppress uptake of Ni by plants respectively. Production of citrate in soil may increase risk of Ni contamination of underground and surface water sources while arginine can decrease soil solution Ni and in turn the risk of water contamination...|$|E

40|$|Authors: Vera Fonseca, Margaret Packer, Gary Carvalho, Deborah Power, John Lambshead & Simon Creer ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} separation of marine meiofauna from sediment and subsequent environmental DNA extraction. In this study meiofauna samples were taken with a 45 mm core from the upper 5 to 10 cm of sediment layer. Separation from sediment was achieved using a decantation process followed by isolation from fine silt using repetitive centrifugation steps with a 1. 16 specific gravity (sg) LUDOX-TM solution. Meiofauna were deliberately separated from macrofauna by using a 1 mm sieve {{on top of a}} bottle-top sterile 45 µM sieve. High quality DNA was subsequently obtained using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) with minor adjustments to the manufacturer’s protocol. This procedure allowed efficient isolation of meiofaunal representatives from marine sediments and also extraction of high quality environmental DNA {{that can be used for}} downstream metagenetic analysis. ### Reagents 1. DESS: 20 % DMSO, 0. 25 M disodium EDTA, saturated with NaCl, pH 8. 0 (1). - LUDOX-TM concentrate: 800 ml of conc. LUDOX-TM, 1200 ml of dH 2 O, shake vigorously until solution is homogenous, rectify specific gravity (sg) until it is 1. 16. - DNA lysis buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 5; 100 mM NaCl; 100 mM EDTA; 1 % SDS, 500 µg/ ml proteinase K - QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) - 100 % Ethanol - 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes, 15 ml falcon tubes, 50 ml falcon tubes ### Equipment 1. 1 mm and 45 µM analytical grade stainless steel <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sieves</b> - Bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filters and disposable filter holder (Millipore, NY 4104700 and MVHAWG 124) - UV transilluminator chamber - Bench-top centrifuge with swing-arm rotor and adapters for 15 ml and 50 ml rotor adapters - - 20 C and - 80 C freezers ### Procedure **CRITICAL** Where possible, all equipment should be autoclaved between samples. If not possible, the use of a UV transilluminator/ cross linker (according to manufacturer’s instructions) and/or immersion in sodium metabisulfite solution will reduce cross contamination between samples. **Meiofauna extraction** *Separation from sediment – decantation* 1. Collect benthic samples (ca. 150 ml) into storage pots containing 300 ml of DESS solution. - TIP: Maintain at least 1 : 3 ratio of wet sediment sample to DESS ratio for efficient DNA preservation. - Dispose the aqueous DESS-phase of each benthic sample through a 45 µM <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sieve</b> into a chemical waste container and rinse with 45 µM filtered water. DMSO should not be introduced into freshwater ecosystems. - Pour all the sediment-phase of each benthic sample into a 2 L measuring cylinder and rinse the storage pot as well as the 45 µM <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sieve</b> with 45 µM filtered tap water into the cylinder. - Fill the 2 L measuring cylinder with 45 µM filtered tap water, seal with lid, invert the cylinder vigorously 10 times and let it rest for no more than 30 seconds. - Gently pour the decanted samples onto a 45 µM <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sieve</b> and repeat steps 4 and 5 six times. - TIP: Do not lean the cylinder more than a 40 degree angle; the less sediment in suspension decanted with your community, the better. - Localise your biotic sample into the corner of the sieve and rinse into a sample pot using DESS and store the pots at 4 C until use. *Separation from fine silt – centrifugation* 1. Use a 1 mm sieve on top of a bottle-top sterile 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter and pour in the DESS decanted sample, keep a DESS container under the last sieve (e. g. petri dish). - Wash the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter with distilled water. - Again, wash the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter but this time with 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM and pour it into a 50 ml falcon tube and top up if necessary with 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM up to 2 cm from the top. - TIP: Do not use too much 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM since each sample should fit into a 50 ml falcon tube. - Shake the 50 ml falcon tube vigorously, centrifuge for 5 min at 4000 rpm and carefully pour the centrifuged sample into the bottle-top membrane filter. - TIP: If samples are contaminated with fine sediments, use a vacuum filter system to help with the process. - Re-use the retained 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM for each sample and repeat step 3 five times. - Rinse the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter with distilled water. - Carefully detach the bottle-top sterile 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter and with the help of sterile forceps and blade, carefully fold and slice the 45 µM filter into three pieces. - Place the sliced 45 µM membrane filter inside a 15 ml falcon tube and store at - 80 C until subsequent DNA extraction. *DNA extraction* 1. C overnight in 3 ml of DNA lysis buffer assisted by spinning wheel mixing.  1. Incubate each sample retained in the 15 ml falcon tubes at 56 - Transfer the 3 ml digested solution into a sterile 50 ml falcon tube. - Add 6 ml of Buffer AL (QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, Qiagen) and mix thoroughly by inversion. - Add 5 ml of 100 % ethanol and mix thoroughly by inversion. - Follow QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) manufacturer’s protocol. - TIP: Centrifugation and incubation times were increased by up to 15 - 30 minutes as this will ensure complete removal of Buffers AW 1 and AW 2. - Incubate each sample in 700 µl of AE Buffer (Qiagen) for at least 4 h- 8 h, prior to elution via centrifugation for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. - TIP: A second elution with the same amount of AE Buffer can be performed overnight at room temperature as this results in higher DNA yields. - Keep samples in 1. 5 – 2 ml tubes at - 20 C until subsequent PCR amplification. ### Timing About 2 days Meiofauna extraction, 1 h and 20 minutes per sample; sample digestion, 16 hours; DNA extraction, 2 hours; DNA elution, 4 - 6 hours ### References 1.

A pair of five days old WBPH was released into a wooden cage covered with <b>wire</b> mesh <b>sieve.</b> Thirty days old rice plant {{in a pot}} {{was placed on the}} floor of the wooden cage. The single sex method was applied in the life table study. Life tables and population parameters were constructed based on unlimited food supply and a natural enemies-free environment. Results showed that the highest mortality occurred in the immature stages, especially in the first and second instars. The life table analysis showed that population densities of S. furcifera decreased gradually. The proportion of male to female observed was 1 : 0. 88. The females could live for a maximum of 12 days. The trend of oviposition showed a peak at about the 10 th day of the female life span. The mean number of eggs produced per female was 8. 75. The intrinsic rate of increase (r m) was 0. 06999 per female per day and daily finite of increase (λ) was 1. 0255 per female per day, with a mean generation time (T) of 34. 97 days. The net reproductive rate (Ro) of the population was 9. 2732. The population Doubling Time (DT) was within 10. 88 days.

30|$|The {{understanding}} of screening process is incomplete regarding {{the intricacies of}} particle-particle and particle-machine interactions. But the influence of these interactions on the screening process effects on both the efficiency {{and the value of}} the product (Soldinger 2000; Zhao et al. 2000; Jiao et al. 2006). We divide the screening process into four parts as follows: (1) looseness: the void space that occurs between particles which are rebounded by the sieve plate. A sufficient void space contributes to particle stratification (Zhang and Tong 2012). (2) Stratification: the ability of the fine particles to penetrate the coarse granules, when all particles are scattered. In other words, stratification relates to the ability of the fine particles to approach the screening surface (Xiao and Tong 2012). (3) Collision: once close to the screening surface, some particles impact the <b>sieve</b> <b>wires</b> and some pass through the sieve mesh. These particles that are near the mesh are referred to as the collision particles (Wei et al. 1999). (4) Penetration: the penetration rate is the fraction of the collision particles which penetrate the mesh. It has a direct effect on screening performance.|$|R
