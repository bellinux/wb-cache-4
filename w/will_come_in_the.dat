25|$|According to {{the early}} scriptures, the Nirvana {{attained}} by Arahants is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as {{there is only one}} type of Nirvana. Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to Arahants because the Buddha discovered the path all by himself and taught it to others (i.e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). Arahants, on the other hand, attained Nirvana partly because of the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant future.|$|E
