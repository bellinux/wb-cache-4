5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce.</b> Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s in the United States, the first {{televised}} recipe for clam dip {{appeared on the}} Kraft Music Hall show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As salsa became more popular among American consumers, the popularity of clam dip declined.|$|E

5|$|The Bulletin {{noted that}} a 2011 edition of the drink {{produced}} in Oregon was made with bacon vodka manufactured on site at the restaurant The Blacksmith. A report by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in April 2012 observed that a variety on the cocktail made by mixologist Paul Yeomans in Florida was concocted utilizing bacon salt and tomato water, infused with cucumber vodka. This version was a favorite selection among customers at The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida. The Food Network recommended additional ingredients including lemon juice, bourbon, <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> and horseradish.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} can be used, such as lemon juice, <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> onion, scallions, shallots, chives, garlic, {{and pepper}} sauce. The ingredients can be mixed using a food processor. It is sometimes {{served as a}} hot dip, which can be kept warm using a chafing dish, and melted cheese {{can be used as}} an ingredient in hot versions. It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Worcester was {{the final}} battle of the English Civil War, where Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army {{defeated}} King Charles I's Cavaliers. Worcester {{is known as the}} home of Royal Worcester Porcelain, composer Edward Elgar, Lea & Perrins, makers of traditional <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> University of Worcester and Berrow's Worcester Journal claimed to be the world's oldest newspaper.|$|E
25|$|One of Worcester's {{most famous}} products, Lea & Perrins <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce</b> is made and bottled at the Midland Road factory in Worcester, {{which has been}} the home of Lea & Perrins since 16 October 1897. Mr Lea and Mr Perrins {{originally}} met in a chemist's shop {{on the site of the}} now Debenham's store in the Crowngate Shopping Centre.|$|E
25|$|Steak tartare is a French dish {{made from}} finely chopped or ground (minced) raw meat (often beef). More accurately, {{it is scraped}} {{so as not to}} let even the {{slightest}} of the sinew fat get into the scraped meat. It is often served with onions, capers, seasonings such as fresh ground pepper and <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> and sometimes raw egg yolk.|$|E
25|$|The ripened {{fruit is}} {{considered}} the more palatable, as it becomes sweeter and less sour (acidic) as it matures. It is used in desserts, as a jam, blended into juices, or sweetened drinks, sorbets, ice creams and other snacks. In Western cuisine, it is found in <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>Sauce.</b> In most parts of India, tamarind extract is used to flavor foods, in curries and traditional dishes, and tamarind sweet chutney is popular in India and Pakistan as a dressing for many snacks. Tamarind pulp is a key ingredient in flavoring curries and rice in south Indian cuisine, {{as well as in}} the Chigali lollipop. Across the Middle East, from the Levant to Iran, tamarind is used in savory dishes, notably meat-based stews, and often combined with dried fruits to achieve a sweet-sour tang.|$|E
25|$|Street vendors crowd Eje 1 North and {{the side}} streets on either side in both the La Lagunilla and Tepito neighborhoods. Those closest to the fixed market {{buildings}} often sell items similar to that which is inside, and those located near the formal occasion shops emulate these as well. This informal market has grown such that vendors with stalls and vehicles now routinely block several of the main avenue’s six lanes. The problem begins from Comonfort Street, two blocks from Paseo de la Reforma. Here, vendors have taken over the lane dedicated to buses, with stands selling clothing, food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs and more. In some side streets, traffic is cut in half and in the smallest, there is no passage of vehicular traffic at all on weekends. In total, there are eleven city blocks severely affected by this. Cuauhtémoc borough authorities state {{that they do not}} have enough personnel to effect an eviction of the vendors. Earlier attempts to do this have resulted in threats to administration officials. Another issue is that many roving vendors sell beer and customers in the market proper can be seen drinking their purchases as they walk through the aisles. The most popular form of buying beer here is a “michelada” with a large bottle of beer (940ml) called a caguama emptied into a large cup and mixed with lime juice, salt and sometimes chili pepper and <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce.</b> These vendors do not ask for proof of age. This informal market has made La Lagunilla one of the main centers for the production and sale of bootlegged CDs and DVDs.|$|E
500|$|Kenny {{is turned}} into a zombie after a {{mortician}} accidentally knocks <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> a fermented liquid condiment, into his embalming fluid. Parker and Stone originally planned to have a Dr Pepper fall into the embalming fluid (in a belated response to that product's slogan [...] "Dr Pepper, What's the Worst That Could Happen?"), but it was changed after the soft drink company objected to that use of their product.|$|E
500|$|The Caesar {{was invented}} in 1969 by {{restaurant}} manager Walter Chell of the Calgary Inn (today the Westin Hotel) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. [...] He devised the cocktail after being tasked to create a signature drink for the Calgary Inn's new Italian restaurant. [...] He mixed vodka with clam and tomato juice, <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> and other spices, creating a drink similar to a Bloody Mary but with a uniquely spicy flavour.|$|E

500|$|A Caesar is a {{cocktail}} created and primarily consumed in Canada. [...] It typically contains vodka, a caesar mix (a blend of tomato juice and clam broth), hot sauce, and <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime. What distinguishes {{it from a}} Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka.|$|E
500|$|Basic {{preparation}} of a Caesar follows the [...] "one, two, three, four" [...] rule. [...] The recipe calls for 1–1½ oz of vodka, two dashes of hot sauce, three dashes {{of salt and}} pepper, four dashes of <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce</b> and topped with 4–6 oz of caesar mix and served with ice. [...] The ingredients are poured into a glass rimmed with celery salt or a mixture of {{salt and pepper and}} garnished with a celery stalk and lime. The Caesar is an unusual drink in that it can be mixed in bulk and stored {{for a period of time}} before drinking.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{thanks to}} Kenny, {{the two men}} are mistakenly {{diagnosed}} to have [...] "pinkeye", but they turn into zombies and go around biting other people, turning them into zombies. Back home, Chef, who sees the outbreak on TV, tries to warn both the doctor and Mayor McDaniels (who is having sex with Officer Barbrady), but his pleas are ignored. The boys go trick-or-treating (Kyle now dressed as a vampire), not noticing the outbreak, and abandon Kenny, who continues to eat people. They arrive at Chef's home, and Chef tells them {{what is really going on}} before taking them to the morgue to stop the outbreak. After discovering the hotline number on the <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce</b> bottle, the boys and Chef are attacked by the zombies with Chef becoming the next victim and dancing with other zombies. Stan and Cartman kill the other zombies with chainsaws and Stan hesitates to kill a zombified Wendy. After Kyle discovers he has to kill the original zombie (after being told complicatedly by the hotline lady), he slices Kenny in half, killing him. The spell is broken and all the zombies turn back to normal. Stan makes up with Wendy and they are about to kiss but he ends up puking on her, leaving her disgusted.|$|E
2500|$|Worcestershire is also {{famous for}} a number of its {{non-agricultural}} products. The original <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> a savoury [...] condiment made by Lea and Perrins, is made in [...] Worcester, and the now closed Royal Porcelain works was based in the city. The town of Malvern is the home of the Morgan traditional sports car. The painting, A Worcestershire Cottage by Arthur Claude Strachan is also of general renown.|$|E

McIlhenny Company also permits other brands {{to use and}} advertise Tabasco sauce as an ingredient in their products (a common marketing practice called [...] "co-branding"), including Spam, Hormel chili, Slim Jim beef sticks, Heinz ketchup, A1 steak sauce, Plochman's mustard, Cheez-It crackers, Lawry's salt, Zapp's potato chips, Heluva Good dip, and Vlasic pickles.|$|E
2500|$|A {{high-quality}} hamburger patty is made {{entirely of}} ground (minced) beef and seasonings; {{these may be}} described as [...] "all-beef hamburger" [...] or [...] "all-beef patties" [...] to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls [...] "lean finely textured beef"), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include {{salt and pepper and}} others like as parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce.</b> Many name brand seasoned salt products are also used.|$|E
2500|$|Recommendations for foods, {{drinks and}} {{activities}} to relieve hangover symptoms abound. The ancient Romans, on {{the authority of}} Pliny the Elder, favored raw owl's eggs or fried canary, while the [...] "prairie oyster" [...] restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, calls for raw egg yolk mixed with <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper. By 1938, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel provided a hangover remedy {{in the form of}} a mixture of Coca-Cola and milk (Coca-Cola itself having been invented, by some accounts, as a hangover remedy). Alcoholic writer Ernest Hemingway relied on tomato juice and beer. Other purported hangover cures include cocktails such as Bloody Mary or Black Velvet (consisting of equal parts champagne and stout). A 1957 survey by an American folklorist found widespread belief in the efficacy of heavy fried foods, tomato juice and sexual activity.|$|E

60|$|Why is {{the first}} health of {{childhood}} lost? Is it not the answer, that childhood is the only period of life in which bodily health is made a prominent object? Take our pretty boy, with cheeks like apples, who started in life with a hop, skip, and dance,--to whom laughter was like breathing, and who was enraptured with plain bread and milk,--how did he grow into the man who wakes so languid and dull, who wants strong coffee and <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce</b> to make his breakfast go down? When and where did he drop the invaluable talisman that once made everything look brighter and taste better to him, however rude and simple, than now do the most elaborate combinations? What is the boy's history? Why, for the first seven {{years of his life}} his body is made of some account. It is watched, cared for, dieted, disciplined, fed with fresh air, and left to grow and develop like a thrifty plant. But from the time school education begins, the body is steadily ignored, and left to take care of itself.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh, if {{you choose}} to play the wit!’ said he,—and began to rail at large upon his destiny, the weather, the cold, the danger and the expense of the escape, and, above all, the cooking of the accursed English. It seemed to annoy him {{particularly}} that I should have joined their party. ‘If you knew what you were doing, thirty thousand millions of pigs! you would keep yourself to yourself! The horses can’t drag the cart; the roads are all ruts and swamps. No longer ago than last night the Colonel and I had to march half the way—thunder of God!—half the way to the knees in mud—and I with this infernal cold—and the danger of detection! Happily we met no one: a desert—a real desert—like the whole abominable country! Nothing to eat—no, sir, there is nothing to eat but raw cow and greens boiled in water—nor to drink but <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce!</b> Now I, with my catarrh, I have no appetite; is it not so? Well, if I were in France, I should have a good soup with a crust in it, an omelette, a fowl in rice, a partridge in cabbages—things to tempt me, thunder of God! But here—day of God!—what a country! And cold, too! They talk about Russia—this is all the cold I want! And the people—look at them! What a race! Never any handsome men; never any fine officers!’—and he looked down complacently for a moment at his waist—‘And the women—what faggots! No, that is one point clear, I cannot stomach the English!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But,' {{says that}} fidgety person, the {{hypothetical}} objector (whom one always sets {{up for the}} express purpose of promptly knocking him down again), 'if it be the business of the fore part of the tongue to warn us against pungent and acrid substances, how comes it that we purposely use such things as mustard, pepper, curry-powder, and vinegar?' Well, in themselves all these things are, strictly speaking, bad for us; but in small quantities they act as agreeable stimulants; and we take care in preparing most of them to get rid of the most objectionable properties. Moreover, we use them, not as foods, but merely as condiments. One drop of oil of capsicums is enough to kill a man, if taken undiluted; but in actual practice we buy it in such a very diluted form that comparatively little harm arises from using it. Still, very young children dislike all these violent stimulants, even in small quantities; they won't touch mustard, pepper, or vinegar, and they recoil at once from wine or spirits. It is only by slow degrees that we learn these unnatural tastes, as our nerves get blunted and our palates jaded; and we all know that the old Indian who can eat nothing but dry curries, devilled biscuits, anchovy paste, pepper-pot, mulligatawny soup, <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> preserved ginger, hot pickles, fiery sherry, and neat cognac, is also a person with no digestion, a fragmentary liver, and very little chance of getting himself accepted by any safe and solvent insurance office. Throughout, the warning in itself is a useful one; it is we who foolishly and persistently disregard it. Alcohol, for example, tells us at once that it is bad for us; yet we manage so to dress it up with flavouring matters and dilute it with water that we overlook the fiery character of the spirit itself. But that alcohol is in itself a bad thing (when freely indulged in) has been so abundantly demonstrated in the history of mankind that it hardly needs any further proof.|$|E
60|$|The mass of good, well-meaning Christians {{are not yet}} {{advanced}} {{enough to}} guess at the change which a perfect fidelity to Christ's spirit and precepts would produce in them. And {{the majority of people}} who call themselves well, because they are not, at present, upon any particular doctor's list, are not within sight of what perfect health would be. That fullness of life, that vigorous tone, and that elastic cheerfulness, which make the mere fact of existence a luxury, that suppleness which carries one like a well-built boat over every wave of unfavorable chance,--these are attributes of the perfect health seldom enjoyed. We see them in young children, in animals, and now and then, but rarely, in some adult human being, who has preserved intact the religion of the body through all opposing influences. Perfect health supposes not a state of mere quiescence, but of positive enjoyment in living. See that little fellow, as his nurse turns him out in the morning, fresh from his bath, his hair newly curled, and his cheeks polished like apples. Every step is a spring or a dance; he runs, he laughs, he shouts, his face breaks into a thousand dimpling smiles at a word. His breakfast of plain bread and milk is swallowed with an eager and incredible delight,--it is so good that he stops to laugh or thump the table now and then in expression of his ecstasy. All day long he runs and frisks and plays; and when at night the little head seeks the pillow, down go the eye-curtains, and sleep comes without a dream. In the morning his first note is a laugh and a crow, as he sits up in his crib and tries to pull papa's eyes open with his fat fingers. He is an embodied joy,--he is sunshine and music and laughter for all the house. With what a magnificent generosity does the Author of life endow a little mortal pilgrim in giving him at the outset of his career such a body as this! How miserable it is to look forward twenty years, when the same child, now grown a man, wakes in the morning with a dull, heavy head, the consequence of smoking and studying till twelve or one the night before; when he rises languidly to a late breakfast, and turns from this and tries that,--wants a deviled bone, or a cutlet with <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> to make eating possible; and then, with slow and plodding step, finds his way to his office and his books. Verily the shades of the prison-house gather round the growing boy; for, surely, no one will deny that life often begins with health little less perfect than that of the angels.|$|E
50|$|Lea and Perrins {{devised the}} recipe in the 1830s, however {{it was not}} to their liking and was set aside and {{forgotten}} about. It was not until the barrels were rediscovered many months later that the taste had mellowed into what is now known as <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce.</b> A high court decided on July 26, 1876 that Lea & Perrins did not have the rights to the term <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> and so the name is not trademarked. Lea & Perrins claims to be The Original <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce</b> and may be the leading global brand of <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> but other brands offer similar recipes.

50|$|Anchovies in many Worcestershire sauces is {{a concern}} to people {{allergic}} to fish, vegans, other vegetarians and others who avoid eating fish.

The US Department of Agriculture has forced the recall of some products with undeclared <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce.</b> Several brands sell anchovy-free varieties of <b>Worcestershire</b> <b>sauce,</b> often labelled as vegetarian or vegan.
