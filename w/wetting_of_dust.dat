The role of dust-induced sea surface temperature (SST) responses in simulations of the climatic effect <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> is examined by using a general circulation model with online simulation <b>of</b> mineral <b>dust</b> and a coupled mixed-layer ocean model. Both the longwave and shortwave radiative effects <b>of</b> mineral <b>dust</b> aerosol are considered in climate simulations. The SST responses {{are found to be}} very influential on simulated dust-induced climate change, especially when climate simulations consider the two-way dust-climate coupling to account for the feedbacks. With prescribed SSTs and dust concentrations, we obtain an increase of 0. 02 K in the global and annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) in response to dust radiative effects. In contrast, when SSTs are allowed to respond to radiative forcing <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> in the presence <b>of</b> the <b>dust</b> cycle-climate interactions, we obtain a global and annual mean cooling of 0. 09 K in SAT by dust.

In contrast, total nitrogen (TN) deposition was related to rainfall and did not follow the pattern observed for PM and TP. The molar TN: TP ratio was significantly lower (i. e., phosphorus-enriched) in dry deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 11. 2) than in wet deposition (TN vs. TP slope = 95. 5). In the study lakes, the molar TN: TP ratios and the Chl a concentrations were significantly influenced by the molar TN: TP ratio and the TP content of atmospheric deposition, respectively. Lake responses were more pronounced in the more phosphorous-limited system.

40|$|In {{order to}} measure the mass flux of {{atmospheric}} insoluble deposition and to constrain regional models <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> simulation, a network of automatic deposition collectors (CARAGA) has been installed throughout the western Mediterranean Basin. Weekly samples of the insoluble fraction of total atmospheric deposition were collected concurrently on filters at five sites including four on western Mediterranean islands (Frioul and Corsica, France; Mallorca, Spain; and Lampedusa, Italy) {{and one in the}} southern French Alps (Le Casset), and a weighing and ignition protocol was applied in order to quantify their mineral fraction. Atmospheric deposition is both a strong source of nutrients and metals for marine ecosystems in this area. However, there are few data on trace-metal deposition in the literature, since their deposition measurement is difficult to perform. In order to obtain more information from CARAGA atmospheric deposition samples, this study aimed to test their relevance in estimating elemental fluxes in addition to total mass fluxes. The elemental chemical analysis of ashed CARAGA filter samples was based on an acid digestion and an elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (MS) in a clean room.

40|$|Here {{we present}} {{a new set of}} {{high-resolution}} early Pleistocene records from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP). Sediment composition from Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1240 and 1238 is used to reconstruct past changes in the atmosphere-ocean system. Particularly remarkable is the presence of laminated diatom oozes (LDOs) during glacial periods between 1. 85 and 2. 25 ?Ma coinciding with high fluxes of opal and total organic carbon. Relatively low lithic particles (coarse and poorly sorted) and iron fluxes during these glacial periods indicate that the increased diatom productivity did not result from dust-stimulated fertilization events. We argue that glacial fertilization occurred through the advection of nutrient-rich waters from the Southern Ocean. In contrast, glacial periods after 1. 85 ?Ma are characterized by enhanced <b>dust</b> transport <b>of</b> finer lithic particles acting as a new source of nutrients in the EEP. The benthic ecosystem shows dissimilar responses to the high productivity recorded during glacial periods before and after 1. 85 ?Ma, which suggests that the transport processes delivering organic matter to the deep sea also changed.

Because its symptoms, including general weakness, headache, chills, body aches, and cough, are similar {{to other forms of}} respiratory illness, it is often misdiagnosed and treated. Other common clinical characteristics of the illness included impaired pulmonary function, increase of white blood cells, and absence of antibodies typically associated with certain allergic lung disease, including farmer's lung with which it is most often confused. The risk of developing this illness can be reduced by being aware of the adverse effects <b>of</b> breathing organic <b>dust</b> when shoveling or moving organic materials such as oats, wood chips, composted leaves, and silage. Other risk reducing measures included: informing one's doctor <b>of</b> recent <b>dust</b> exposure when seeking treatment for respiratory illness, carefully harvesting and storing agricultural products to reduce spoilage, using automated or mechanized equipment to move decayed materials, using source containment, local exhaust ventilation, and <b>wet</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> suppression, and using NIOSH approved respirators when exposure to organic dust cannot be avoided.

40|$|Proper {{rock dusting}} {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means <b>of</b> preventing coal <b>dust</b> explosions. Rock dust (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the preheating of unburned coal particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities <b>of</b> dispersible rock <b>dust</b> must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application <b>of</b> rock <b>dust</b> dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to rock dust application methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities <b>of</b> rock <b>dust</b> are applied to the roof, ribs, and floor throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the rock dusting application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys <b>of</b> rock <b>dusting</b> practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} <b>of</b> the rock <b>dusting</b> practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period.

This note provides a rough estimate of {{the total amount of}} arsenic emission as well as emission ratio from steam coal combustion in China. The results show that by combustion of 1 t of Permo-Carboniferous coal (containing roughly 5 mg/kg arsenic), high-temperature power stations emit roughly 0. 40 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 7. 70 %: mid-low power stations emit roughly 0. 15 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 2. 97 %. a total of 600 million tons coal is burnt annually in China power stations. and the coal comes mainly from Permo-Carboniferous depositing in the North China Plate and northwest China coal mines. Taking the average arsenic content of the coal used at the value of 5 mg/kg. the total annual arsenic emission from steam coal combustion into the atmosphere is about 195. 0 t. Most of the arsenic in coal can be released in the process of coal combustion. and the most of the released arsenic can be seized by the fly ash and then both of them are seized by the <b>dust</b> catcher <b>of</b> power station. so the arsenic emission ratio to the atmosphere is declined: in addition. research on the arsenic emission amount and emission rules from the coal power stations in China should go on the coal power stations with the dry-process dust catchers by the experiments results.

This introductory paper describes the objectives of DUNE and the implementation plan of a series of mesocosm experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2008 and 2010 during which either wet or dry and a succession <b>of</b> two <b>wet</b> deposition fluxes <b>of</b> 10 g m - 2 <b>of</b> Saharan <b>dust</b> have been simulated based on the production <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> analogs from erodible soils of a source region. After the presentation of the main biogeochemical initial conditions of the site at the time of each experiment, a general overview of the papers published in this special issue is presented. From laboratory results on the solubility of trace elements in dust to biogeochemical results from the mesocosm experiments and associated modeling, these papers describe how the strong simulated dust deposition events impacted the marine biogeochemistry. Those multidisciplinary results are bringing new insights into the role of atmospheric deposition on oligotrophic ecosystems {{and its impact on the}} carbon budget. The dissolved trace metals with crustal origin - Mn, Al and Fe - showed different behaviors as a function of time after the seeding. The increase in dissolved Mn and Al concentrations was attributed to dissolution processes. The observed decrease in dissolved Fe was due to scavenging on sinking dust particles and aggregates. When a second dust seeding followed, a dissolution of Fe from the dust particles was then observed due to the excess Fe binding ligand concentrations present at that time. Calcium nitrate and sulfate were formed in the dust analog for wet deposition following evapocondensation with acids for simulating cloud processing by polluted air masses under anthropogenic influence. Using a number of particulate tracers that were followed in the water column and in the sediment traps, it was shown that the dust composition evolves after seeding by total dissolution of these salts. This provided a large source of new dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the surface waters. In spite of this dissolution, the typical inter-elemental ratios in the particulate matter, such as Ti / Al or Ba / Al, are not affected during the dust settling, confirming their values as proxies of lithogenic fluxes or of productivity in sediment traps. DUNE experiments have clearly shown the potential for Saharan wet deposition to modify the in situ concentrations of dissolved elements of biogeochemical interest such as Fe and also P and N. Indeed, wet deposition yielded a transient increase in dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) followed by a very rapid return to initial conditions or no return to initial conditions when a second dust seeding followed. By transiently increasing DIP and DIN concentrations in P- and N-starved surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea, <b>wet</b> deposition <b>of</b> Saharan <b>dust</b> can likely relieve the potential P and/or N limitation of biological activity; this has been directly quantified in terms <b>of</b> biological response. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> strongly stimulated primary production and phytoplanktonic biomass during several days. Small phytoplankton (3 μm) significantly increased after the second one, indicating that larger-sized cells need further nutrient supply in order to be able to adjust their physiology and compete for resource acquisition and biomass increase. Among the microorganisms responding to the atmospheric inputs, diazotrophs were stimulated by both wet and dry atmospheric deposition, although N 2 fixation was shown to be only responsible for a few percent of the induced new production. Dust deposition modified the bacterial community structure by selectively stimulating and inhibiting certain members of the bacterial community. The microbial food web dynamics were strongly impacted by dust deposition. The carbon budget indicates that the net heterotrophic character (i. e., ratio of net primary production to bacteria respiration 2 source. Nonetheless, the system was able to export organic material, half of it being associated with lithogenic particles through aggregation processes between lithogenic particles and organic matter. These observations support the "ballast" hypothesis and suggest that this "lithogenic carbon pump" could represent a major contribution of the global carbon export to deep waters in areas receiving high rates of atmospheric deposition. Furthermore, a theoretical microbial food web model showed that, all other things being equal, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometric mismatch along the food chain can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem response to nutrient inputs from dusts, with changes in the biomass of all biological compartments by a factor of ~ 2 - 4, and shifts from net autotrophy to net heterotrophy. Although the model was kept simple, it highlights the importance of stoichiometric constrains on the dynamics of microbial food webs...|$|R

Those multidisciplinary results are bringing new insights into the role of atmospheric deposition on oligotrophic ecosystems {{and its impact on the}} carbon budget. The dissolved trace metals with crustal origin – Mn, Al and Fe – showed different behaviors as a function of time after the seeding. The increase in dissolved Mn and Al concentrations was attributed to dissolution processes. The observed decrease in dissolved Fe was due to scavenging on sinking dust particles and aggregates. When a second dust seeding followed, a dissolution of Fe from the dust particles was then observed due to the excess Fe binding ligand concentrations present at that time. Calcium nitrate and sulfate were formed in the dust analog for wet deposition following evapocondensation with acids for simulating cloud processing by polluted air masses under anthropogenic influence. Using a number of particulate tracers that were followed in the water column and in the sediment traps, it was shown that the dust composition evolves after seeding by total dissolution of these salts. This provided a large source of new dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the surface waters. In spite of this dissolution, the typical inter-elemental ratios in the particulate matter, such as Ti / Al or Ba / Al, are not affected during the dust settling, confirming their values as proxies of lithogenic fluxes or of productivity in sediment traps. DUNE experiments have clearly shown the potential for Saharan wet deposition to modify the in situ concentrations of dissolved elements of biogeochemical interest such as Fe and also P and N. Indeed, wet deposition yielded a transient increase in dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) followed by a very rapid return to initial conditions or no return to initial conditions when a second dust seeding followed. By transiently increasing DIP and DIN concentrations in P- and N-starved surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea, <b>wet</b> deposition <b>of</b> Saharan <b>dust</b> can likely relieve the potential P and/or N limitation of biological activity; this has been directly quantified in terms <b>of</b> biological response. <b>Wet</b> deposition <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> strongly stimulated primary production and phytoplanktonic biomass during several days. Small phytoplankton ( 3 μm) significantly increased after the second one, indicating that larger-sized cells need further nutrient supply in order to be able to adjust their physiology and compete for resource acquisition and biomass increase. Among the microorganisms responding to the atmospheric inputs, diazotrophs were stimulated by both wet and dry atmospheric deposition, although N 2 fixation was shown to be only responsible for a few percent of the induced new production. Dust deposition modified the bacterial community structure by selectively stimulating and inhibiting certain members of the bacterial community. The microbial food web dynamics were strongly impacted by dust deposition. The carbon budget indicates that the net heterotrophic character (i. e., ratio of net primary production to bacteria respiration < 1) of the tested waters remained (or was even increased) after simulated wet or dry deposition despite the significant stimulation <b>of</b> autotrophs after <b>wet</b> events. This indicates that the oligotrophic tested waters submitted to dust deposition are a net CO 2 source. Nonetheless, the system was able to export organic material, half of it being associated with lithogenic particles through aggregation processes between lithogenic particles and organic matter. These observations support the "ballast" hypothesis and suggest that this "lithogenic carbon pump" could represent a major contribution of the global carbon export to deep waters in areas receiving high rates of atmospheric deposition. Furthermore, a theoretical microbial food web model showed that, all other things being equal, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometric mismatch along the food chain can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem response to nutrient inputs from dusts, with changes in the biomass of all biological compartments by a factor of ~ 2 – 4, and shifts from net autotrophy to net heterotrophy. Although the model was kept simple, it highlights the importance of stoichiometric constrains on the dynamics of microbial food webs...|$|R

Drilling, blasting, loading, transportation, crushing, conveying, haul road and the exposed overburden face generate large quantities <b>of</b> fugitive <b>dust.</b> Silica is a potential carcinogen and its exposure to the workers may be detrimental to their health which may result in progress of silicosis and lung cancer. Prediction <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> concentration in and around the mine is essential to have an impact assessment of the mining activity over the surrounding environment. In the view of this, current project work focuses on the real time monitoring <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> level at different sources of the mine using DustTrak II, personal exposure <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> to different workers using personal <b>dust</b> sampler, characterization <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> collected from different locations using FT-IR and finally prediction <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> concentration at different locations of the mine and nearby areas using AERMOD view software. Lakhanpur opencast project, the largest opencast mine of MCL in the Ib valley area producing more than 15 MT of coal per annum, was chosen for study to have a better knowledge about the impact assessment due to dust from large opencast mines. The monitoring was conducted during December 2013 to assess scenario <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> pollution. The dust concentration was found to vary between 0. 474 mg/m 3 to 150. 0 mg/m 3 in PM 10.

40|$|We present {{simulations}} <b>of</b> the <b>dust</b> cycle during {{present and}} glacial climate states, using a model, which explicitly simulates the control <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> emissions {{as a function}} of seasonal and interannual changes in vegetation cover. The model produces lower absolute amounts <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> emissions and deposition than previous simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) dust cycle. However, the simulated 2 - to 3 -fold increase in emissions and deposition at the LGM compared to today, is in agreement with marine- and ice-core observations, and consistent with previous simulations. The mean changes are accompanied by a prolongation of the length of the season <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> emissions in most source regions. The increase is most pronounced in Asia, where LGM dust emissions are high throughout the winter, spring and summer rather than occurring primarily in spring as they do today. Changes in the seasonality <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> emissions, and hence atmospheric loading, interact with changes in the seasonality of precipitation, and hence of the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> and dry deposition processes at high northern latitudes. As a result, simulated dust deposition rates in the high northern latitudes show high interannual variability. Our results suggest that the high dust concentration variability shown by the Greenland ice core records during the LGM is a consequence of changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation locally rather than a result of changes in the variability <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> emissions. 19 page(s...|$|R
