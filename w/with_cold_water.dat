5|$|Mainstream, non-pornographic manga also {{frequently}} contains explorations {{of gender and}} sex roles, although usually for purposes of exoticism or comedy {{rather than in a}} realistic manner. Some supporting characters cross-dress, such as Nuriko from Fushigi Yuugi, and some series are centred around the idea of changing sex, such as Ranma ½, whose protagonist changes sex, but not gender, when splashed <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> IS, a manga about two intersexual characters, won the 2007 Kodansha Manga Award in the girls' manga division. Class S is a genre of girl's fiction that tells stories about crushes between a female upperclassman and an underclassman. Maria-sama ga Miteru, a contemporary series which includes a manga adaptation, {{has been described as a}} revival of the Class S genre.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of Kronan was {{estimated}} at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and {{about half of the}} cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore {{in the interest of the}} Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from Vasa had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of Kronan's cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. June–August) of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to Vasa with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on Kronan. The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of Kronan's 36-pounder guns.|$|E

3000|$|Water {{formed by}} the mixing of {{geothermal}} <b>water</b> <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> ground or surface water possesses many chemical characteristics which serve to distinguish it from unmixed geothermal water. The {{reason is that the}} chemistry of geothermal water is characterized by equilibrium conditions between solutes and alteration minerals at relatively high temperatures, whereas the composition of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> appears to be mostly determined by the kinetics of the leaching process (Arnórsson 1985). Geothermal water, which ascends from a reservoir and emerges at the surface in hot springs, may cool by conduction, mixing <b>with</b> <b>colder</b> <b>water</b> or a combination of these processes. In addition, complete or partial chemical re-equilibration may occur as temperature decreases. The effect of mixing of geothermal <b>water</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> can be explained with the help of Giggenbach triangular diagram and Schoeller diagram [...]...|$|R

25|$|Blood flow to {{the muscles}} is lower in cold water, but {{exercise}} keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled.

25|$|Body-cooling: {{peripheral}} vasoconstriction {{results in}} cooling of peripheral tissue beds, which lower their oxygen demand in a thermodynamic manner. In addition, Murat et al. (2013) recently discovered that breath-holding results in prompt and substantial brain cooling, {{just like in}} diving birds and seals. (Dry) breath-holds result in cooling {{on the order of}} about 1°C/minute, but this is likely to be greater <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> submersion, in proportion to the magnitude and promptness of the dive response.|$|E
25|$|In {{analysis}} of biological systems, Inorganic salts, {{which are also}} part of protein extracts, interfere with the ionization process. The salts can be removed by solid phase extraction or by washing the dried-droplet MALDI spots <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> Both methods can also remove other substances from the sample. The matrix-protein mixture is not homogenous because the polarity difference leads to a separation of the two substances during co-crystallization. The spot diameter of the target is much larger than that of the laser, which makes it necessary to make many laser shots at different places of the target, to get the statistical average of the substance concentration within the target spot.|$|E

25|$|Gibraltar's first tunnels were {{constructed}} by {{hand in a}} slow, backbreaking but remarkably long-lasting method of excavation. The first task was to fragment the limestone rock.

The fragments were then removed with crowbars and sledgehammers.|$|E
25|$|Blood flow to {{skin and}} fat are {{affected}} by skin and core temperature, and resting muscle perfusion {{is controlled by the}} temperature of the muscle itself. During exercise increased flow to the working muscles is often balanced by reduced flow to other tissues, such as kidneys spleen and liver. Blood flow to the muscles is also lower in cold water, but exercise keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion in cold water. Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs <b>with</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion. Variations in perfusion distribution do not necessarily affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in perfusion. Rest in a cold environment will reduce inert gas exchange from skin, fat and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present. Inert gas exchange is least favourable for the diver who is warm and exercises at depth during the ingassing phase, and rests and is cold during decompression.|$|E

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him.
