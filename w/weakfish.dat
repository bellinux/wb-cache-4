25|$|The Scandinavian {{fisherman}} {{founded the}} Independent Dock, {{which is now}} known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of scallops, tuna, swordfish, tilefish, <b>weakfish,</b> monkfish, bluefish, shad, dogfish, and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign trawlers were permitted to fish in the area. Nearly all of the cod to have been fished out of the area. The scallop boat Lindsay L, docked at Viking Village, was used in the movie The Perfect Storm.|$|E
25|$|Striped bass has {{firm and}} flavorful flesh {{with a large}} flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a more fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including <b>weakfish,</b> tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E
25|$|The daggernose shark poses little {{danger to}} humans {{due to its}} small size and teeth. This shark is caught in small numbers by {{subsistence}} fishers in Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guyana. It also comprises about one-tenth of the catch of a northern Brazil floating gillnet fishery targeting Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) and Acoupa <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion acoupa), which operates in estuaries during the dry season. This shark is often found in markets, but is not highly regarded as a food fish. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Critically Endangered, as it has a limited distribution and is highly susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate. The daggernose shark has declined over 90% {{over the past decade}} off Brazil, and similar declines have likely also occurred elsewhere in its range as fishing pressure in the region continues to grow more intense. The IUCN has urgently recommended the implementation of conservation schemes and the expansion of fishery monitoring for this species. Evidence also points to this species being on the verge of or already in reproductive collapse.|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} within the Stellifer group of <b>weakfishes</b> (Stellifer, Odontoscion, Ophioscion, and Bairdiella) were evaluated using 2723 base pairs comprising sequences of nuclear (rhodopsin, TMO- 4 C 4, RAG- 1) and mitochondrial (16 S rRNA and COI) markers obtained from specimens of nine species. Our results indicate {{a close relationship}} between Bairdiella and Odontoscion, and also that the genus Stellifer is not monophyletic, but rather that it consists of two distinct lineages, one clade containing S. microps/S. naso/S. brasiliensis and the other, S. rastrifer/S. stellifer/Stellifer sp. B, which is closer to Ophioscion than the former clade. The O. punctatissimus populations from {{the northern and southern}} Brazilian coast were also highly divergent in both nuclear (0. 8 % for rhodopsin and 0. 9 % for RAG- 1) and mitochondrial sequences (2. 2 % for 16 S rRNA and 7. 3 % for COI), which we conclude is consistent with the presence of two distinct species. The morphological similarities {{of the members of the}} Stellifer group is reinforced by the molecular data from both the present study and previous analyses, which have questioned the taxonomic status of the Stellifer group. If, on the one hand, the group is in fact composed of four genera (Stellifer, Ophioscion, Odontoscion, and Bairdiella), one of the two Stellifer clades should be reclassified as a new genus. However, if the close relationship and the reduced genetic divergence found within the group is confirmed in a more extensive study, including representatives of additional taxa, this, together with the morphological evidence, would support downgrading the whole group to a single genus. Obviously, these contradictory findings reinforce the need for a more systematic taxonomic revision of the Stellifer group as a whole...|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|E
60|$|Among the {{customers}} at Bogle's {{was a young}} man named Seeders, who worked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair, and appeared to have been recently rough-dried and starched. He was too diffident to aspire to Aileen's notice; so he usually sat at one of Tildy's tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled <b>weakfish.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Weakfish</b> {{are also}} {{known by the}} American Indian name Squeteague. In the mid-Atlantic states, the fish is {{sometimes}} referred to by the name sea trout, {{though it is not}} related to the fishes properly called trout, which are in the family Salmonidae.|$|E
50|$|The Sciaenidae are {{a family}} of fish {{commonly}} called drums or croakers {{in reference to the}} repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. The family includes the <b>weakfish,</b> and consists of about 275 species in about 70 genera; it belongs to the order Perciformes.|$|E
50|$|It is in turn an {{important}} prey item {{for a variety}} of larger fish, including <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion regalis), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), chain pickerel (Esox niger), and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). Birds such as royal terns (Thalasseus maximus) and Sandwich terns (T. sandvicensis) feed on it.|$|E
5000|$|Cynoscion arenarius (sand seatrout, sand <b>weakfish</b> or, {{as it is}} also known, white trout) is {{a common}} species of drum fish found in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. While not {{especially}} popular or targeted, it is still known as a sport fish and is often caught by anglers of these waters. Research in biochemistry suggests that the sand seatrout may actually be a subspecies of the <b>weakfish</b> that lacks spots. [...] Often confused with the silver seatrout, the sand seatrout is larger and more often found inshore than its similar-appearing offshore cousin. It also has a slight yellow hue, whereas the silver seatrout is more silver overall. It averages at one pound and is reportedly a good fish for eating.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened in}} the summer of 1888 and by the {{following}} year it served a small community consisting of six fishing clubs, two saloons, and a hotel. The area was known as a popular fishing ground for <b>weakfish</b> and boats could be hired at the docks.|$|E
50|$|The bigclaw {{snapping}} shrimp {{feeds on}} worms, small crustaceans and fish such as gobies and pearlfish. It is itself eaten by the <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion regalis).

50|$|The redfin {{and grass}} pickerels occur {{primarily}} in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, lakes, and swamps, and are carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish. Larger fishes, {{such as the}} striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bowfin (Amia calva), and gray <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion regalis), in turn, prey on the pickerels when they venture into larger rivers or estuaries.|$|E
50|$|In turn, {{bluefish}} are preyed upon by larger predators at {{all stages}} of their lifecycle. As juveniles, they fall victim {{to a wide variety}} of oceanic predators, including striped bass, larger bluefish, fluke (summer flounder), <b>weakfish,</b> tuna, sharks, rays, and dolphins. As adults, bluefish are taken by tuna, sharks, billfish, seals, sea lions, dolphins, porpoises, and many other species.|$|E
50|$|The corvina {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to its relatives the <b>weakfish</b> and spotted seatrout.
