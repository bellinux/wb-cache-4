5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{started to}} affect New Caledonia on 5January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300mm (12in) of rain on {{parts of the}} archipelago, which made {{all of the major}} rivers {{overflow}} and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, <b>waves</b> <b>from</b> Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Pongsona first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported.

5|$|Rough <b>waves</b> <b>from</b> Typhoon Etau {{produced}} rip currents on Saipan {{that swept}} up four swimmers, who were later rescued after holding onto a buoy.

5|$|September 14, 2001– Tropical Storm Gabrielle hits Venice, {{dropping}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall including a peak total of 15.1inches (384mm) in Parrish.

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock <b>waves</b> <b>from</b> the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

5|$|Across the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, {{with a total of}} about 5inches (125mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked that higher amounts likely occurred in higher elevations. The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along {{the southern}} coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43mph (69km/h), with one of those reporting wind gusts to 55mph (89km/h). The storm caused minor damage to buildings and utility lines. <b>Waves</b> <b>from</b> the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.|$|E
5|$|As Emilia first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while Emilia was just off the coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong <b>waves</b> <b>from</b> the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, <b>waves</b> <b>from</b> the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E
