5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> and {{worth the cost}} of the game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich {{began his}} formal study {{of art in}} 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art {{department}} is now named Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich {{to the work of}} the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.|$|E

25|$|Allott <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> at the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England May/June 1999. With 20 wickets in nine matches he {{topped the}} wicket taking ranks for the tournament. Gaining prodigious {{movement}} {{in the air and}} off the pitch, the left-armer deceived some of the world's best batsmen, and made a huge contribution towards New Zealand's semi-final finish.|$|E
25|$|The Turbo name {{alluded to}} the speed of {{compilation}} and of the executables produced. The edit/compile/run cycle was fast compared to other Pascal implementations because everything related to building the program was stored in RAM, {{and because it was}} a one-pass compiler written in assembly language. Compilation was much faster than compilers for other languages (even Borland's own later compilers for C), and other Pascal compilers, and programmer time was also saved since the program could be compiled and run from the IDE. The execution speed of these COM-format programs <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> for developers whose only prior experience programming microcomputers was with interpreted BASIC or UCSD Pascal, which compiled to p-code which was then interpreted at runtime.|$|E
25|$|The artwork {{produced}} by the refugee students at the art school was quite {{different from that of}} the other students. They “were doing harsh and emotional art fuelled by bitterness and anger. They had long conversations about Käthe Kollwitz and swapped books and newspapers about politics and art in Europe. Picasso’s Guernica of 1937 and his other war-inspired painting and sculpture and the work of other European artists were now the subject of endless discussion.” However, the cultural transition was not all one way. The Glasgow choirs sang Scottish folk songs and Afro-American spirituals: music that had been suppressed in Germany and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> to refugees like King, who understood its relevance to the times.|$|E

25|$|In 2014–15, {{during the}} 2015 winter {{transfer}} window, the team club sold star winger Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea for €30million but {{were able to}} secure the loan of Mohamed Salah in exchange, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> {{in the second half}} of the season. Their 2014–15 Europa League campaign saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Spanish side Sevilla, the eventual champions. In the 2014–15 domestic season, Fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the 2015–16 Europa League. In June 2015, Vincenzo Montella was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club, later appointing Paulo Sousa on 21 June as the team's new head coach.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Jacques Monod, Jean-Pierre Changeux and François Jacob {{discovered}} the lac operon in the bacterium Escherichia coli. It was {{a cluster of}} genes, arranged in a feedback control loop so that its products would only be made when [...] "switched on" [...] by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was an enzyme that splits a sugar, lactose; and lactose itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation,</b> as it showed {{for the first time}} that genes, even in an organism as small as a bacterium, were subject to fine-grained control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.|$|E
500|$|MTV's James Montgomery {{compared}} the video {{to the visual}} of [...] "Still Into You"—the second single of Paramore. He wrote, [...] "That clip <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation,</b> {{the beginning of a}} bold new chapter for the band, and [...] keeps that winning streak alive. Montgomery went on to call it [...] "blissed out and buzzy, born of a brilliant concept, and an absolute blast to watch". [...] Fuse's Nicole James surmised that the world records were [...] "adorable", while Steff Yotka of Nylon deemed them [...] "crazy, funny, weird" [...] and concluded that they [...] "make for a truly excellent viewing experience" [...] On the critical side, Mish Way—writing for Vice—opined that the video's concept did not relate to the song's theme. Way dubbed the clip a [...] "major fuck-up" [...] but called Williams an [...] "irresistible charm".|$|E

500|$|Kari Herbert {{notes in}} The Guardian's list of travel writer's {{favourite}} travel books that she inherited her father, English polar explorer Wally Herbert's [...] "well-loved copy" [...] of Newby's book. [...] "Like Newby, I {{was in a}} soulless job, desperate for change and adventure. Reading A Short Walk <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation.</b> The superbly crafted, eccentric and evocative story of his Afghan travels was like a call to arms." [...] John Gimlette, in the same list, chooses Newby's Love and War in the Apennines. The Telegraph includes {{it as one of}} its [...] "20 best travel books of all time", describing Newby and Carless's meeting with the explorer Wilfred Thesiger as a [...] "hilarious segment". It quotes [...] "We started to blow up our air-beds. 'God, you must be a couple of pansies,' said Thesiger." [...] Outside magazine includes A Short Walk among its [...] "25 essential books for the well-read explorer".|$|E
500|$|In July 1945, {{after the}} Red Cross {{confirmed}} {{the deaths of}} the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw {{for the first time the}} more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, [...] "For me it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation...</b> I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself". Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.|$|E
2500|$|Reed's {{breakthrough}} album, Transformer, {{was released}} in November 1972. Transformer was co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK.

2500|$|Car and Driver in a 1977 Astre road test, said, [...] "The Astre is the Vega-polished {{and refined}} and {{significantly}} improved, {{but still a}} Vega in perhaps its ultimate state of development..It remained for Pontiac to do what Chevrolet probably should {{have done in the}} first place: the substitution of the marvelous old Chevy II cast-iron four-cylinder econo-motor for the much-troubled aluminum-block Vega engine. Sliding in and starting the engine <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> because its so quiet and smooth compared to the Vega. Also the Astre's interior trim was judged more plush than Vega's.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effective}} use of modern heavy field guns by the Boers during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> to armies in Europe including the British. [...] They were impressed by their mobility and range. [...] Britain used some heavy guns in that war under ad hoc arrangements. [...] After the capture of Pretoria in 1900 Lord Roberts, the commander-in-chief in South Africa (and an artillery officer), had stated the requirements of a heavy field gun: a range of 10,000 yards, weight behind the team {{of no more than}} 4 tons and the largest possible shell, accordingly the Ordnance Committee in London ordered experimental guns and three were trialled.|$|E

The TV series director Ayub Khawar is quite skillful in doing his job and is highly rated among the TV directors of Pakistan.|$|R
2500|$|Community of Christ {{removed the}} [...] "Lectures on Faith" [...] in 1897. The 1970 World Conference {{concluded}} that several sections {{that had been}} added between the 1835 and 1844 editions—mainly dealing with the subjects of temple worship and baptism for the dead—had been published without proper approval of a church conference. As a result, the World Conference removed sections 107, 109, 110, 113, and 123 to a historical appendix, which also includes documents that were never published as sections. Of these, only section 107 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation.</b> The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 108A contained the minutes of a business meeting, which, because of its historical nature, {{was moved to the}} Introduction in the 1970s. After 1990, the Introduction was updated, and what was section 108A was removed entirely.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1945 Boulez {{moved to}} two small attic rooms at 4 rue Beautreillis in the Marais {{district}} of Paris, {{where he lived}} for the next fourteen years. The following month he attended a private performance of Schoenberg’s Wind Quintet, conducted by René Leibowitz, a follower of Schoenberg. The piece <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> {{to him and he}} organised a group of fellow students to take private lessons with Leibowitz. It was here that he first studied twelve-tone technique and discovered the music of Webern. [...] Around this time he was {{one of a number of}} Conservatoire students (organised, it was said, by Leibowitz) who booed a performance of Stravinsky's Danses concertantes, a work whose neo-classicism represented the pre-war culture he was determined to reject. Eventually he also found Leibowitz's approach too doctrinaire and he broke angrily with him in 1946 when Leibowitz tried to criticise one of his early works.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
