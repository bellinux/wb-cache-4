Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E
500|$|Northcott {{joined the}} Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) {{as a major}} general on 1 September 1941 and was given the AIF serial number VX63396. He was {{attached}} to the British 7th Armoured Division in the Middle East to study armoured warfare, returning to Australia in December 1941 to organise the new 1st Armoured Division. The job was a challenging one that some of his subordinates felt that Northcott was not up to, given his lack of command experience. In March 1942, Northcott found out from The Herald newspaper that he was to be promoted to command II Corps. [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> me", was his comment, [...] "just as my first tank is coming down the road". The new post came with a promotion to the temporary rank of lieutenant general on 6 April 1942, which became substantive on 12 December 1945. Northcott was succeeded as commander by Major General Horace Robertson, an officer with a distinguished combat record in the desert.|$|E

[...] Vazgen Sargsyan was hit several times. Hunanyan claimed that the eight deaths and dozens of injuries in the attack were all [...] "innocent victims" [...] except for the case of Sargsyan, who he said had [...] "failed the nation". Anna Israelyan, an eyewitness journalist, stated that [...] "the first shots were fired directly at Vazgen Sargsyan at a distance of one to two meters" [...] and, in her words, [...] "it was impossible that he would have survived." [...] Gagik Saratikyan, a cameraman, was the first person from outside to be allowed to go into the building while the men were in control of it. Saratikyan recorded the dead bodies of Vazgen Sargsyan and Karen Demirchyan. Sargsyan's body was taken out of the parliament building on the evening of October 27.|$|E

They shot dead Vazgen Sargsyan, National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan, Deputy National Assembly Speakers Yuri Bakhshyan and Ruben Miroyan, Minister of Urgent Affairs Leonard Petrosyan, and Parliament Members Henrik Abrahamyan, Armenak Armenakyan and Mikayel Kotanyan.

60|$|Again, it is {{notoriously}} {{the nature of}} man to attribute every institution to a primal inventor or legislator. Men then, find themselves performing certain rites, often of a buffooning or scandalous character; and, in origin, mainly magical, intended for the increase of game, edible plants, or, later, {{for the benefit of}} the crops. Why do they perform these rites? they ask: and, looking about, as usual, for a primal initiator, they attribute <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> a primal being, the Corn Spirit, Demeter, or to Zeus, or to Baiame, or Manabozho, or Punjel. This is man's usual way of going back to origins. Instantly, then, a new set of parasitic myths crystallises round a Being who, perhaps, was originally moral. The savage mind, in short, has not maintained itself on the high level, any more than the facetious mediaeval myths maintained themselves, say, on the original level of the conception of the character of St. Peter, the keeper of the keys of Heaven.|$|E

6000|$|The {{advantage}} of [...] "divine right," [...] or irremovable legitimacy, is this; {{that there is}} a limit to the ambitions of the rich. [...] "Roi ne puis"; the royal power, whether it was or was not the power of heaven, was in one respect like the power of heaven. It was not for sale. Constitutional moralists have often implied that a tyrant and a rabble have the same vices. It has perhaps been less noticed that a tyrant and a rabble most emphatically have the same virtues. And one virtue which they very markedly share is that neither tyrants nor rabbles are snobs; they do not care a button <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> wealthy people. It is true that tyranny was sometimes treated as coming from the heavens almost in the lesser and more literal sense of coming from the sky; a man no more expected to be the king than to be the west wind or the morning star. But at least no wicked miller can chain the wind to turn only his own mill; no pedantic scholar can trim the morning star to be his own reading-lamp. Yet something very like this is what really happened to England in the later Middle Ages; and the first sign of it, I fancy, was the fall of Richard II.|$|E
