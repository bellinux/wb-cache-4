5|$|On 28 February 1944 he {{took off}} and claimed a German lorry {{destroyed}} south of Paris in a daylight sortie. The Mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids. It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult. For Braham, hunting in daylight <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> experience. On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900-mile trip around northern France. The weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at Orleans and Bourges, so he proceeded to the aerodrome at Châteaudun. He spotted a Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet. He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory. Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity. In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock, a series of strikes against British cities {{in response to the}} British offensive over Germany. The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation.|$|E

Very few sides in world cricket take two left arm slow bolwers in their side. In fact, at the time of Rafique's arrival, many thought that Moni's {{international}} career will be over, specially, given his rather indifferent form during the 5th ICC Trophy in Kenya early in 1994. Yet, right from the beginning, the two formed a wonderful combination which went on to serve the national squad throughout the '90s.|$|E

The gallery was moved in 1993 and the old gallery became home to the BBC Red Button control room. Upgraded to HD in July 2010, the first 3D capable studio in the UK. Home to children's programmes Live & Kicking and Dick and Dom in da Bungalow, and Pointless. This studio was demolished during the redevelopment of Television Centre.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} in a soy sauce shop long ago, in Totsuka-juku of the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), it {{sometimes}} happened that napkins would disappear in the night one by one. One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from {{a place where there}} should have been no people around.

25|$|At {{that time}} the Armenians served {{side by side with}} the Norsemen who were in the Byzantine army. This first {{encounter}} between the Armenian mountain-dwellers and the Norse has been discussed by Nansen, who brings these two elements closer to each other and records: “It was the Armenians who together with our Scandinavian forefathers made up the assault units of Byzantine.” Moreover, Bussel underlines the similarities in the way of thinking and the spirit of the Armenian feudal lords and the northern warriors. He claims that, in both groups, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> absence and ignorance of government and public interest and at the same time an equally large interest in achieving personal distinctions and a loyalty towards their masters and leaders.|$|E
25|$|On the Batavian {{right wing}} of General Daendels, {{absolutely}} nothing happened that day, as the inundations made his lines impenetrable. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> incident when the British General Don, under cover of a flag of truce, tried to get permission to cross the Batavian lines {{on a mission to}} the Batavian government. As on the Batavian left wing the battle had clearly started, Daendels considered this an abuse of the flag of truce. Besides, Don turned out to have papers on his person that could be considered to be of a seditious nature. Daendels therefore arrested Don as a spy and sent him to Brune's headquarters. Don was incarcerated in the fortress of Lille and only years later exchanged for the Irish rebel James Napper Tandy.|$|E

25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E

Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's {{philosophical}} {{treatise on}} education, [...] (1762), {{is one of}} the major literary influences on Mary. A few months before starting the work, Wollstonecraft wrote to her sister Everina: [...] "I am now reading Rousseau's Emile, and love his paradoxes ... however he rambles into that chimerical world in which I have too often wandered ... He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> inconsistent unhappy clever creature—yet he possessed an uncommon portion of sensibility and penetration" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Rousseau, she notes, [...] "chuses [...] a common capacity to educate—and gives as a reason, that a genius will educate itself" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). When Mary was published, the title page included a quotation from Rousseau: [...] "L'exercice des plus sublimes vertus éleve et nourrit le génie" [...] ("the exercise of the most sublime virtues raises and nourishes genius"). The novel is therefore, in many ways, an early bildungsroman, or novel of education.|$|E
500|$|The actor Richard Harris {{bought the}} lease for £75,000 in 1969 after {{discovering}} that the American entertainer Liberace {{had made an}} offer but had not put down a deposit.

In his autobiography, the entertainer Danny La Rue recalled visiting the house with Liberace, writing, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> building and had eerie murals painted on the ceiling... I sensed evil". Meeting La Rue later, Harris said {{he had found the}} house haunted by the ghosts of children from an orphanage that had previously occupied the site and that he had placated them by buying them toys. Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith & Company Ltd., to carry out restoration, using Burges's drawings from the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

500|$|Lia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell {{inviting}} {{him to make}} a song for the new Bond movie, which would [...] "reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond", with a [...] "strong male singer". Cornell thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> offer, considering that he is American, and imagined that he would perform a secondary song in the film instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he [...] "wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies". But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued the musician, and he decided to accept the job. Cornell then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting, and was much impressed with the film's emotional content after he was shown a rough cut of Casino Royale. In Prague he also met the score composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song [...] "that echoed the film score".|$|E

But then, as they neared the north, the air began to reek of broken drains, raw sewage and the stench of rotting cattle. Trees which had begun to look forward to spring became instead blackened, ragged stumps, their twisted branches pushed to the sky like the crippled arms of a dying man. Everywhere was mud.

500|$|While the Tower {{may have}} been [...] "the only {{possible}} place", in some respects it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> choice. It had not {{been used as a}} state prison for many years and the last execution there– that of Lord Lovat, the Jacobite rebel– had taken place in 1747. It was one of London's most popular tourist attractions, recording over 400,000 visitors a year {{by the end of the}} 19th century, and remained open to tourists even on the day of Lody's execution. During the Tower's heyday, executions had been carried out in the open air on Tower Hill or Tower Green, but Lody's execution was to take place at the Tower's rifle range located in the eastern part of the Outer Ward between Martin and Constable Towers, behind the Outer Curtain wall and out of public sight. The Tower's custodians, the Yeomen Warders ("Beefeaters"), had long since become tourist guides rather than active-duty soldiers, so eight men were selected from the 3rd Battalion, to carry out the sentence.|$|E

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was written}} by U2 and No Line on the Horizon producers/co-writers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois during a two-week {{recording}} session in Fez, Morocco between May and June 2007. The song was developed within a few hours, and then recorded in a single take in a riad of the hotel Riad El Yacout. Eno began by creating a percussion loop of a [...] "rolling hand drum" [...] so that the band would have something to improvise along with when they joined him for songwriting and recording. However, Eno had not arranged the loop properly and the result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> uneven beat that he compared to [...] "a wheeled carriage that {{had one of the}} wheels a bit cracked" [...] or [...] "the way a camel moves". Although Eno was trying to fix the loop, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. began playing along to it. Eno then asked guitarist the Edge to play some chords. After a quick discussion about the chord changes and the meter (in which they decided to have a [...] "funny layout" [...] that was not based on [...] "eighths or sixteenths"), the six of them improvised the entirety of the piece.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
