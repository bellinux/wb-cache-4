After the critical and commercial {{failure of the}} previous album Risk (1999), The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero represented a change back to a heavier musical direction. Subsequently, the album charted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 upon release.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on May 15, 2001 in the United States and sold 61,000 copies in its first week of release, entering the Billboard 200 at number 16. The album sold another 25,000 copies in its second week, falling to number 59. The album also charted in Poland (#17), Germany (#36), Sweden (#38), and Switzerland (#55) as well.

Megadeth commenced a tour to promote the album on June 8, 2001 at Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, where they were featured alongside acts such as AC/DC, The Offspring, and Queens of the Stone Age. Following {{the breakup of the}} band in 2002, six of the album's songs appeared on Still Alive... and Well?, a 2002 compilation combining studio tracks from The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, with six live tracks.|$|E
5|$|After parting {{with former}} label Capitol Records, {{the album was}} the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be {{released}} by Sanctuary.

5|$|A European {{tour with}} AC/DC {{in support of}} The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero began in mid-2001, {{followed}} by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening. That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.|$|E

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark {{has a responsibility to}} use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that the <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> him and that he must leave their farm and go where he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets they found him in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis.|$|E
500|$|After 15 {{years with}} Capitol Records, Megadeth left the label in July 2000. According to Mustaine, the {{departure}} {{was due to}} ongoing tensions with Capitol management. Capitol returned the band's newest recordings and released a greatest hits album, , with two new tracks: [...] "Kill the King" [...] and [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind". In November, Megadeth signed with Sanctuary Records. The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album, The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to Risk, Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself. The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for [...] "Promises", which had contributions from Pitrelli. Two days before the release of The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero, Megadeth appeared in an episode of VH1's Behind the Music showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaine's old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.|$|E

To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album Still Alive... and Well?

500|$|In 1999, Megadeth {{released}} its eighth studio album, Risk. The album was noteworthy {{for being a}} drastic musical departure for the band, and {{the culmination of the}} band's increasing attempts for mainstream success throughout the 1990s, a trend starting with Countdown to Extinction (1992). The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero marks a stylistic transition towards the band's thrash metal roots. Furthermore, the album had been touted by the band as an [...] "antidote" [...] to Risk in a press release. However, the album has been noted by several music critics as still retaining some commercial feel from previous albums.|$|E

He broke into Evans' office, read her files, and asks Michael if he is awake or asleep. However, Gemini says that the <b>world</b> <b>needs</b> people like him and Michael; people who can see it sideways. As he takes a flight to Portland, Gemini says that he hopes Michael doesn't wake up and then hangs up.|$|E
500|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Needs</b> a Hero was {{released}} in May 2001, and debuted at number sixteen on the Billboard 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the album's artwork was [...] "unsuitable for the nation's youth". Consequently, the band canceled its August 2 concert in Kuala Lumpur. The album marked Megadeth's return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums, but critics felt it fell short of expectations. Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself {{to get back on}} course. Its lead single, [...] "Moto Psycho", reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
