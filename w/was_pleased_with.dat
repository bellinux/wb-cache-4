40|$|This article {{discusses}} the ambiguity which is {{resulted from the}} dissimilar versions of the life story of the poet Suheem Abd bani Al Hashass. One of the stories tells that the prophet Mohamed (Alla bless him and grant him salvation) quoted him when he said : Getting old and Islam prevent people from committing sins. Stories also tell us that Abdulla bin Abi Rabeea, father of the poet Omer bin abi Rabeea, who was the chief commander of the army offered the poet (Suheem) to Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) for sale to be a slave. However, Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) refused the offer. One more story is that, the poet read to Omer bin Alkhatab (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) the first verse of his famous poem which all of its verses end in the Arabic equivalent of the letter (Y). The meaning of the verse reads as follows : Say goodbye to Omayra when preparing yourself to go away Getting old and Islam prevent from committing sins. After hearing this verse, Omer (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) said to the {{that he was going}} to be killed. According to the story, the poet was killed during Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) era for his immorality and repugnant attitudes. The articles {{discusses the}} different versions of the poet's life stories because of the ambiguity resulted from the these versions. Thus, it does not make sense when the prophet Mohamed (Alla bless him and grant him salvation) quoted the poet's poetry and the Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) refused to buy him as a slave. Then Omer (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) said to the poet {{that he was going to}} be killed when he had read one of his poem. Ironically, the poet was killed during Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) era. According to these stories, the misunderstanding has occurred because the poet was a mature and poet who had been cited by others during Prophet Mohamed (Alla bless him and grant him salvation) era and the same person was a young boy offered for sale to Othman (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him). then the same poet went to Omer (may Alla <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> him) to read him his poem which starts with piety and followed by an immoral verse. According to the story the poet was killed during Othman ear (٢٣-٣٥ H) which means he was an old man then and was not killed while his immorality days. The article dose not tackle all the poet's life stories as it is intended to make a balance between his poetry and his life details so as a logic order of events is maintained.
