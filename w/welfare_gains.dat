A study by the University of Michigan found that if all trade barriers in agriculture, services, and manufactures were reduced by 33% {{as a result of the}} Doha Development Agenda, there would be an increase in global welfare of $574.0billion. A 2008 study by World Bank Lead Economist Kym Anderson found that global income could increase by more than $3000billion per year, $2500billion of which would go to the developing world. Others had been predicting more modest outcomes, e.g. world net <b>welfare</b> <b>gains</b> ranging from $84billion to $287billion by the year 2015. Pascal Lamy has conservatively estimated that the deal will bring an increase of $130billion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system of}} land tenureship in India {{as a whole}} and Bengal in {{particular}} was very complex, and the credit transactions between landholders and tenants were equally complicated. Very broadly speaking, land rights and the resulting power and <b>welfare</b> <b>gains</b> within Bengal were divided very unequally among three diverse economic and social groups; moreover, this division of power evolved over time and expressed itself differently within the different geographic regions of the province. The three economic groups were: traditional absentee large landowners or zamindars, the upper-tier [...] "wealthy peasant" [...] jotedars; and at the lower socioeconomic levels, the ryot (peasant) smallholders and dwarfholders, bargadars (sharecroppers), and agricultural labourers. Zamindar and jotedar landowners were protected by legal and customary status and rights. At the bottom were the ones actually cultivating the soil, with small or no landholdings. These had very nearly no rights, and the few they had were vague, contradictory and commonly ignored. Typically this problem was compounded by a lack of written records. They laboured within a power structure decisively stacked against them and suffered persistent and increasing losses of land rights and welfare over time.|$|E

The discounted present value of the <b>welfare</b> <b>gain</b> of TTIP, which leads to the elimination of tariffs and cuts in non-tariff measures by 25 %, is in the range of 1 % to 4 % of initial consumption, depending on the parameterization.

50|$|Although {{the central}} {{question}} for the double dividend hypothesis and the tax interaction literature has been whether the <b>welfare</b> <b>gains</b> from environmental taxation in a second-best world are larger or smaller than in a first-best setting, the Tax Interaction literature takes this central question and frames it indirectly, by asking whether the second-best optimal environmental tax is higher or lower than the first-best Pigouvian rate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} CSF, {{a general}} equilibrium model encompassing factors of relevance to economic efficiency in Federal/State funding including: interstate differences in tax bases and unit costs of State-provided goods; factor mobility; congestion; State-government behaviour incorporating the possibility that governments in subsidised States embark on expenditures with low benefit/cost ratios (flypaper effects); fiscal externalities; and non-discretionary expenditures in each State associated with special national responsibilities. The model is applied to Australia where Federal/State funding is a major political and economic issue. Welfare effects of moving from the present Australian funding system based on fiscal equalisation {{to a system of}} equal-per-capita grants are calculated. CSF implies that the <b>welfare</b> <b>gain</b> from this move would be small. The most important source of potential <b>welfare</b> <b>gain</b> is a reduction in flypaper effects. The recognition of congestion externalities can eliminate the small <b>welfare</b> <b>gain,</b> but only under seemingly extreme assumptions.

5000|$|The {{concertina}} model, {{sometimes referred}} to as the concertina rule or [...] "concertina method", is an international trade liberalisation strategy, which consists in removing the highest tariffs first. Amiti (2004, p. 3) traces this [...] "idea back to Meade (1955, Trade and Welfare) who concluded that the <b>welfare</b> <b>gains</b> will be larger if tariffs on those goods with the highest tariffs are reduced first. This result was formalized by a number of authors, including Bertrand and Vanek (1971) and Falvey (1988) for a small, open, perfectly competitive economy." [...] The concertina method consists in a piecemeal approach to trade reforms, however, with a clear quantitative priority setting. The concertina model is also highlighted briefly in Dani Rodrik's book One Economics, Many Recipes and Max Corden's textbook Trade Policy and Economic Welfare. Haussmann, Rodrik and Velasco (HRV)(Growth Diagnostics, 2004) refer to the concertina method as a simple trade and more specifically, tariff reform, second best strategy. The concertina method is a general rule of thumb, which consists in eliminating the highest tariffs first, and so on, until ideally all tariffs are eliminated. [...] "HRV" [...] see 5 possible reform strategies: 1. Wholesale reform ("augmented Washington Consensus": getting prices and institutions right) 2. Do as much and as best as you can (opportunistic approach, e.g. picking low [...] "hanging fruits", etc.) 3. Sophisticated second-best reform (many trade offs)4. Target the largest distortions ("concertina rule") and 5. Focus on the most binding constraints. Targeting the largest distortions first in the overall economic reform agenda is not very practical as many important distortions (e.g. with respect to institutions) cannot be easily quantified, hence a deeper qualitative analysis is needed. Focussing on the binding constrainst is seen by these [...] "HRV" [...] as the best practical reform agenda. It is superior to the [...] "concertina rule" [...] and also to the so-called [...] "augmented Washington Consensus" [...] which is an impossibly broad and ambitious reform agenda that is insufficiently differentiated according to the needs of different countries. The Concertina policy approach {{can be seen as a}} simple rule of thumb approach for an easy quantifiable problem. Reforming implies planning. However planning has clear limits due to limits to rationality ("bounded rationality" [...] see Simon (1957) and Lindblom (1979)). The HRV approach again is an approach based on rationality. Human interactions often defy a clear rationality or rationality changes with respect to the number of peoples or interest groups involved (see Olson, Mancur's Logic of Collective Action).|$|E
