5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Today Latin American {{music has}} become a term for music {{performed}} by Latinos regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a Latin element or not. Acts such as Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Selena Gomez, Christina Aguilera, Gloria Estefan, Demi Lovato, Mariah Carey, Becky G, Paulina Rubio, and Camila Cabello are prominent on the pop charts. Iglesias who holds the record for most #1s on Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks released a bilingual album, inspired by urban acts he releases two completely different songs to Latin and pop formats at the same time.|$|E

25|$|G1/S {{transition}} is a rate-limiting {{step in the}} cell cycle and {{is also known as}} restriction point.

6000|$|That then which I {{would have}} the reader inquire {{respecting}} every work of art of undetermined merit submitted to his judgment, is not <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> be a work of especial grandeur, importance, or power; but <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> any virtue or substance as a link in this chain of truth, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> recorded or interpreted anything before unknown, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> added one single stone to our heaven-pointing pyramid, cut away one dark bough, or levelled one rugged hillock in our path.

God appoints to {{every one of his}} creatures a separate mission, and if they discharge it honorably, if they quit themselves like men and faithfully follow that light which is in them, withdrawing from it all cold and quenching influence, there will assuredly come of it such burning as, in its appointed mode and measure, shall shine before men, and be of service constant and holy.

25|$|Secondary {{structure}} is formally {{defined by the}} pattern of hydrogen bonds between the amino hydrogen and carboxyl oxygen atoms in the peptide backbone.

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{removal of the}} primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining {{the extent of the}} disease and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Staging is a major determinant of prognosis and of the need for adjuvant therapy. Occasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment.|$|E

The icon bar (Dock) holds icons which represent mounted disc drives, RAM discs, running applications, system utilities and docked: Files, Directories or inactive Applications. These icons have context-sensitive menus and support drag-and-drop behaviour. They represent the running application as a whole, irrespective of <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> open windows.|$|E

25|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old. While rectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk features in those over the age of 50, other commonly described symptoms including weight loss and change in bowel habit are typically only concerning if associated with bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Another {{weakness}} of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is {{the difficulty in}} determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building orogeny releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations. Moreover, further evidence is accumulating that large-scale remagnetization events have taken place which may necessitate revision of the estimated positions of the palaeomagnetic poles.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal cancer {{refers to}} {{malignant}} {{conditions of the}} gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on {{the location of the}} tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis.|$|E
