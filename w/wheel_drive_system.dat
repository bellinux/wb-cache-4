25|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} and that could be developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system.</b> Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system,</b> Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.|$|E
25|$|The Audi V8 had a {{galvanized}} steel body, with a 10-year anti-perforation warranty (against corrosion). The Audi V8 was {{specifically designed to}} be a top of the range 'flagship' car and included a number of luxury features as standard equipment, including leather seating and Audi's quattro all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> (see standard features list). The Audi V8 created a new elevated image for the company, providing a viable alternative to established competitors such as Mercedes-Benz. In this regard, the car was a cornerstone in developing the history of the Audi marque as it is today.|$|E

50|$|General Motors {{and other}} {{automotive}} companies {{are seeking to}} develop a magnetorheological fluid based clutch system for push-button four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems.</b> This clutch system would use electromagnets to solidify the fluid which would lock the driveshaft into the drive train.|$|R
25|$|The ESC {{system uses}} several sensors to {{determine}} what the driver wants (input). Other sensors indicate the actual {{state of the vehicle}} (response). The control algorithm compares driver input to vehicle response and decides, when necessary, to apply brakes and/or reduce throttle by the amounts calculated through the state space (set of equations used to model the dynamics of the vehicle). The ESC controller can also receive data from and issue commands to other controllers on the vehicle such as an all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> or an active suspension system to improve vehicle stability and controllability.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system,</b> it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

2500|$|SH-AWD ("Super Handling" [...] All Wheel Drive) is a multi-vectoring all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> {{designed}} {{more for}} performance than for simply providing traction in adverse circumstances. While cruising, the system sends 90% {{of the power}} to the front wheels and 10% to the rear wheels. Acceleration puts more torque on the rear wheels. The car can put up to 70% of the total available power to the rear wheels to assist with rapid acceleration, and of that 70%, 100% can be pushed to either {{the left or right}} wheel in order to assist the vehicle through a corner.|$|E
2500|$|During 2009 Porsche updated the 997 line-up {{including}} styling changes, {{a revised}} engine with direct injection {{and the introduction}} of the company's new [...] "PDK" [...] dual clutch transmission. As a result, the updated 997 models were faster, lighter and more fuel efficient than the outgoing versions, with improved handling. In the case of the 997 Turbo, a comprehensively re-tuned all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> with an optional [...] "torque vectoring" [...] system was also a part of the upgrades package; in an October 2009 preliminary review, Car and Driver magazine estimated that when equipped with the PDK transmission, the updated Turbo should be capable of accelerating from 0- in three seconds.|$|E

50|$|A {{more recent}} {{exception}} to this is the Torsen differential, which uses worms and planetary worm gears {{in place of the}} bevel gearing of conventional open differentials. Torsen differentials are most prominently featured in the HMMWV and some commercial Hummer vehicles, and as a centre differential in some all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems,</b> such as Audi's quattro. Very heavy trucks, such as those used to carry aggregates, often use a worm gear differential for strength. The worm drive is not as efficient as a hypoid gear, and such trucks invariably have a very large differential housing, with a correspondingly large volume of gear oil, to absorb and dissipate the heat created.|$|R

50|$|Dilatant {{materials}} have certain industrial uses {{due to their}} shear thickening behavior. For example, some all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> use a viscous coupling unit full of dilatant fluid to provide power transfer between front and rear wheels. On high traction road surfacing, the relative motion between primary and secondary <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> is the same, so the shear is low and little power is transferred. When the primary <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> start to slip, the shear increases, causing the fluid to thicken. As the fluid thickens, the torque transferred to the secondary <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> increases proportionally, until {{the maximum amount of}} power possible in the fully thickened state is transferred. See also: limited slip differential, some types of which operate on the same principle.....To the operator, this system is entirely passive, engaging all four <b>wheels</b> to <b>drive</b> when needed, and dropping back to two <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> once the need has passed. This system is generally used for on-road vehicles rather than off-road vehicles, since the maximum viscosity of the dilatant fluid limits the amount of torque that can be passed across the coupling.|$|R
