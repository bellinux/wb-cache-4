5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which had taken off to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by ground fire. The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers. The Bell then <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> other Colt, and the helicopter's crew chief fired an AK-47 through a sliding window, shooting the biplane down.|$|E
5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> puck in the Chicago end while {{being chased by}} Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E

5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they <b>went.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E
5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed {{it as if it were}} Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E
5|$|When it advanced, Brisbane's brigade {{came under}} {{artillery}} fire that caused many casualties. The brigade finally reached some dead ground where the guns could not hit them, but French skirmishers began picking off the soldiers. After some urging by Edward Pakenham, Brisbane continued the attack. The 1/45th Foot fought its way {{close to the}} top of the ridge where Joseph François Fririon's brigade of Foy's division held the ridgeline. On the left of Brisbane's brigade, the 1/88th Foot had two companies guarding the divisional artillery battery as it began pounding the French line. Soult spotted the threat and ordered a squadron of the 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval to charge. The cavalry overran the two companies, inflicting heavy losses, and then <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> gunners. The remaining companies of the 88th immediately opened fire on the French horsemen, mowing most of them down. The 21st Chasseurs went into combat 401 strong but 11 days later reported only 236 men on active duty. The 88th Foot suffered 269 killed and wounded, by far the most of any British unit.|$|E

25|$|Dirk Nannes {{was their}} first buy, but their most {{surprising}} purchase was South Africa's bowling allrounder Chris Morris for $625,000. Soon after getting Morris, the Super Kings <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Sri Lankan spinner Sachithra Senanayake too, but lost him to Kolkata Knight Riders. Towards {{the end of the}} auction they picked up Australian seamer Ben Laughlin, Sri Lankan spinner Akila Dananjaya and the towering West Indian quick Jason Holder, all at their respective base prices.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E

25|$|According to Brichto, {{the early}} Israelites {{apparently}} {{believed that the}} graves of family, or tribe, united into one, and that this unified collectivity is to what the Biblical Hebrew term Sheol refers, the common grave of humans. Although not well defined in the Tanakh, Sheol in this view was a subterranean underworld where {{the souls of the}} dead <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> body died. The Babylonians had a similar underworld called Aralu, and the Greeks had one known as Hades. According to Brichto, other Biblical names for Sheol were: Abaddon (ruin), found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11; Bor (the pit), found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, Ezekiel 26:20; and Shakhat (corruption), found in Isaiah 38:17, Ezekiel 28:8.|$|E
25|$|During this expedition, Frémont trekked {{into the}} Mojave Desert. His party met a Mexican man and boy. The two told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of {{travelers}}. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses. Carson and a mountain man friend named Alexis Godey <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> murderers. They took {{two days to}} find them. They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered {{and returned to the}} Mexican man and boy. This deed brought Carson even greater fame. It confirmed his status as a western hero {{in the eyes of the}} American people.|$|E
25|$|Savage {{returned}} in April 1999, debuting {{a new look}} and theme music, sporting a slicked back ponytail, earrings, and a new villainous attitude (though still embracing the fans), as well as introducing his then 23-year-old girlfriend Gorgeous George as his valet. His first action was as the guest referee in the main event at Spring Stampede, which was won by Diamond Dallas Page. For a short time afterward, Savage interfered in DDP's matches {{to make sure that}} Page kept the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but when Kevin Nash won it at Slamboree, Savage <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> title himself.

25|$|In Feb. 1992, {{he scored}} a memorable 131 against the touring West Bengal {{side in a}} 3-day match at Dhaka. Batting first the {{tourists}} scored 384/5 (decl.) left-handed No. 3 Raja Venkat scored 154, another more well known left-hander Sourav Ganguly made 129. In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. There was good understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.|$|E
25|$|In a day/night {{match at}} St Lawrence Ground, Warwickshire captain Nick Knight sent Kent in to bat, and his South African pace bowler Dewald Pretorius took {{a flurry of}} wickets in good bowling conditions. Ending with five for 32, he took the first five wickets of the innings as Kent {{collapsed}} to 29 for 5, but South Africans Justin Kemp and Martin van Jaarsveld rebuilt quickly. Despite little support - no batsman apart from himself passed 25 - Kemp {{made his way to}} 84 off 93 balls, as Kent scrambled 177 for 9. In reply, Warwickshire got to 19 for 0, but a fiery spell from Martin Saggers yielded three wickets, as Nick Knight, Ian Bell and Jamie Troughton were all dismissed in single figures. Warwickshire's fifth-wicket partners saw off the opening bowling, however, and <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> part-timers instead, in chase of what suddenly looked like a big target of 178.|$|E
25|$|Then on 16 January 1798 Babets boats {{captured}} the French schooner Désirée. The schooner was sailing towards Babet as Babet was sailing between Martinique and Dominique. As {{soon as the}} schooner realized that Babet was a British warship she attempted to escape. The wind failed and the schooner then took to her sweeps. Lieutenant Pym of Babet took 24 men in her pinnace and launch and <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> schooner. After rowing several leagues the boats closed to within range of their cannon, which they then commenced to fire. The British closed on their quarry despite a strong counter-fire. The British then boarded Désirée and took her. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 46 men. The British lost one man killed and five wounded; the French had three men killed and 15 wounded. Désirée was six days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one American brig that had been sailing from St. Vincent to Boston.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure to}} relieve Fort Loudon forced the {{garrison}} to surrender with Captain Demeré and the garrison allowed {{to retain their}} arms and enough ammunition {{to make the trip}} back to the colony provided they left the remaining arms and stores of ammunition to the Cherokee led by Ostenaco. Its garrison marched out of the fort on August 9 with a Cherokee escort. The Indians entered the fort and found 10 bags of powder and ball buried and the cannon and small arms thrown in the river to keep them from the Cherokee. The Indians, angered by the broken agreement, <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> garrison. The next morning the escort had drifted off and the garrison was attacked in the woods by perhaps 700 Indians. Some 22 soldiers, equal to the number of Cherokee chief hostages killed at Fort Prince George, and 3 civilians were killed and 120 taken prisoners. Panic and consternation reigned in Charleston at the news. A truce of six months was agreed to during which peace attempts failed.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Mormant on 17 February 1814, Napoleon's army {{encountered}} a Russian force of 2,500 infantry and 1,800 cavalry under Peter Petrovich Pahlen. The leading French formations arranged themselves into an arrow shape with Victor's infantry in the center. François Étienne de Kellermann led the right flank cavalry with the divisions of Lhéritier and Anne-François-Charles Trelliard while Milhaud led the left flank cavalry with the divisions of Hippolyte Piré and André Briche. Kellermann hurled Lhéritier's division at Pahlen's Cossacks while Trelliard <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Russian infantry. Auguste Etienne Lamotte's brigade defeated two Cossack regiments, but when two more Cossack regiments appeared, Collaert's brigade charged and swept them away. Pahlen lost 2,114 infantry and one-third of his cavalry in the debacle. When the French cavalry pursuit reached Nangis it routed Anton Leonhard von Hardegg's Austrian {{division of the}} Allied V Corps. In the afternoon Lhéritier and Étienne Maurice Gérard's Paris Reserve combined to defeat the 3rd Bavarian Division in the combat of Valjouan. At {{this time there was}} a reorganization of the cavalry so that on 20 February 1814, Collaert became the commander of the 2nd Brigade of Lhéritier's 4th Heavy Cavalry Division in Milhaud's V Cavalry Corps. The 2nd Brigade consisted of 616 horsemen from the 22nd and 25th Dragoons.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They <b>went</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
