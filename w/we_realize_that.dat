25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

[...] He also noted that the Centipede theme was 'dramatically transformed' when Chan kills Agent Quan; [...] "the low brass blast out a huge statement of the Centipede Theme ...

[...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying {{to the rhythm of}} Billy's spiel. [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well.

500|$|Yard {{believed}} that eligible national parks {{had to be}} scenically stunning. [...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page." [...] Yard's standards also insisted upon [...] "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. [...] Often referring to parks as [...] "American masterpieces", he sought {{to protect them from}} economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. [...] In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of [...] "wilderness" [...] conditions in America's national parks.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "soft" [...] {{utilitarian}} {{position on}} animal rights {{is a moral}} intuition of many, probably most, Americans. <b>We</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> animals feel pain, {{and we think that}} to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.|$|E

[...] The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father. [...] Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed. [...] Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him. [...] Amaya witnessed all of this. [...] <b>We</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father.

2500|$|In Buddhism, {{forgiveness}} {{is seen as}} a practice to prevent harmful thoughts from causing havoc on one's mental well-being.

2500|$|Also in {{the fifth}} section, Radhakrishnan offers his {{interpretation}} of three [...] "inadequacies" [...] or [...] "exaggerations" [...] in the Buddha's thought, which [...] "revealed themselves in [...] later history and relation to Hinduism."
