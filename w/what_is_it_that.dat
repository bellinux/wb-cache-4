In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.|$|E

After January 1989, the month that Vulture would 24 years later find to be the movies' worst January ever, New York Times critic Janet Maslin had had enough. Her idea of [...] "movie hell" [...] she said, {{included}} among other indignities having to watch only January releases. [...] "It's well known that January films have a character that is, let us say, distinctive ... <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> leads film distributors to regard January as just the right resting place for so many flukes, black sheep, wild cards and also-rans?" [...] She allowed that recent years had allowed some good films, such as Radio Days and El Norte, to get attention they might note have in other months of the year. However, that January had had as one its major releases The January Man, a thriller she characterized as aptly titled, despite not even being the worst the month had to offer (that dubious honor went to Deepstar Six).|$|E

Genetic science also promises to shed light on who we <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> makes us tick, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> makes us the way we are — in short, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> makes us human. Yet while genetics are a potential saviour (saving us from disease), it also appears as a threat that at the extremes appears to be the stuff of our worst nightmares, such as the prospect, probably more imagined than real, of rows of cloned individuals. The new genetics hold out the promise that through genetics {{we will be able to}} determine <b>what</b> we <b>are,</b> a promise that is simultaneously appealing and terrifying. This chapter discusses the cloning of people and parts, the law’s response to cloning, genetics and diversity, a framework for law reform...|$|R
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, {{and was one of the}} reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

2500|$|The {{post at the}} ICA also afforded Hamilton {{the time}} to further his {{research}} on Duchamp, {{which resulted in the}} 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp's Green Box, which comprised Duchamp's original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton's 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle. Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton's contribution to the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. Just <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This Is Tomorrow, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. Just <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged {{as one of the first}} pieces of Pop Art. Hamilton's written definition of what [...] "pop" [...] is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton's definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: [...] "Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.|$|E

2500|$|Palm Beach {{was to be}} the {{terminus}} of the Flagler railroad, {{but during}} 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit all of Central Florida, whereas the Miami area remained unaffected, causing Flagler to rethink his original decision not to move the railroad south of Palm Beach. The fable that Julia Tuttle, one of two main landowners in the Miami area along with the Brickell family, sent orange blossoms to Flagler to prove to him that Miami, unlike the rest of the state, was unaffected by the frost is untrue. The fact is, that Mrs. Tuttle wired Mr. Flagler to advise him that [...] "the region around the shores of Biscayne Bay is untouched by the freezes." [...] Mr. Flagler sent his two now famous in Florida history lieutenants, James E. Ingraham and Joseph R. Parrott, to investigate and they brought boxes of truck (produce) and citrus back to Mr. Flagler, who then wired Mrs. Tuttle, asking, [...] "Madam, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> you propose?" [...] To convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, both Julia Tuttle and William Brickell offered half of their holdings north and south of the Miami River to Mr. Flagler. [...] Mrs. Tuttle added [...] for shops and yards if Mr. Flagler would extend his railroad to the shores of Biscayne Bay and build one of his great hotels. [...] An agreement was made and contracts were signed. On September 7, 1895, the name of Flagler's system was changed from the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company to the Florida East Coast Railway Company and incorporated. On April 15, 1896, track reached Biscayne Bay, the site of present-day downtown Miami. At the time, it was a small settlement of less than 50 inhabitants. When the town incorporated, on July 28, 1896, its citizens wanted to honor the man responsible for the city's development by naming it Flagler. He declined the honor, persuading them to retain its old Indian name, Miami. The area was actually previously known as Fort Dallas after the fort built there in 1836 during the Second Seminole War. To further develop the area surrounding the Miami railroad station, Flagler dredged a channel, built streets and The Royal Palm Hotel, instituted the first water and power systems, and financed the town's first newspaper, the Metropolis. Flagler was a great visionary and he can be credited {{for the development of the}} entire east coast of Florida. Yet he lacked vision on at least one issue: he felt that Miami would never be more than a fishing village.|$|E
