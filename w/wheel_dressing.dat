50|$|A worn {{grinding}} wheel can be dressed to restore its grinding properties. Dressing a {{grinding wheel}} causes new grains {{to be produced}} on a glazed or loaded grinding wheel. A glazed grinding wheel {{is the result of}} high attritious wear causing the grains to become dull. A loaded grinding wheel is a result of chips clogging the grains on the grinding wheel due to the grinding of soft materials, improper grinding wheel selection processing parameters. In addition to sharpening a grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>dressing</b> {{can also be used to}} true a grinding wheel that is out of round or to shape the profile of a grinding wheel to produce specific features on the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to tire balancing with wheel weights. Most bench grinders never have these operations performed, because <b>wheel</b> <b>dressing</b> alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for bench grinders and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as surface grinders and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes' lack of weight balances out a heavy spot elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange).|$|E
5000|$|Bench grinder wheels {{sometimes}} need to {{be restored}} to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) {{after it has been}} in use for a while, is [...] "quite uncertain". It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and tool rest varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes {{need to be}} dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of wheel dresser. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a bench grinder and then using it for many years without thinking about <b>wheel</b> <b>dressing,</b> the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the wheel guards and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported {{of the dressing}} of metal-bonded diamond saw blades with four different dressing methods – stirring the blade segments in rock slurries, surface grinding the blade segments with Al 2 O 3 <b>wheels,</b> <b>dressing</b> the blade segments with SiC <b>wheels,</b> and <b>dressing</b> the blades through sawing of refractory materials. The surfaces of dressed blade segments were examined by a scanning electron microscope. The protrusion of the diamond grits on the dressed segments was quantitatively assessed using a digital optical microscope. The vertical and horizontal force components and the spindle power were measured in the refractory sawing. The grit protrusion generated by the stirring method {{was found to be}} the highest and most diamond grits remained their original crystal shapes. But it took a quite long period to let the diamond grits protrude from the bond matrix. The protrusion produced by the surface grinding ranked the lowest among the four methods. The height of grit protrusion for either SiC dressing or refractory sawing was found to be about 20 % of the diamond average size, which might be an optimal point with respect to the segment sawing performance. Force analysis indicated that the force per diamond grit in refractory sawing was much lower than the diamond compressive strength. The changes of spindle power in the sawing of refractory materials can be used to in-process monitor the dressing process...|$|R

50|$|Electrolytic in-process {{dressing}} (ELID) grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} accurate grinding methods. In this ultra precision grinding technology the grinding <b>wheel</b> is <b>dressed</b> electrochemically and in-process to maintain the accuracy of the grinding. An ELID cell consists of a metal bonded grinding wheel, a cathode electrode, a pulsed DC power supply and electrolyte. The wheel is connected to the positive terminal of the DC power supply through a carbon brush whereas the electrode is connected to the negative pole of the power supply. Usually alkaline liquids are used as both electrolytes and coolant for grinding. A nozzle is used to inject the electrolyte into the gap between wheel and electrode. The gap is usually maintained to be approximately 0.1mm to 0.3 mm. During the grinding operation one side of the wheel takes part in the grinding operation whereas the other side of the <b>wheel</b> is being <b>dressed</b> by electrochemical reaction. The dissolution of the metallic bond material is caused by the dressing which in turns results continuous protrusion of new sharp grits.|$|R
