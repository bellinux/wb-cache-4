5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a <b>wood</b> <b>yard,</b> used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
25|$|Clarence T. Barrett, Henry P. Judah, and Theodore C. Vermilyen were {{appointed}} as commissioners to appraise {{the value of}} the land required by the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company to extend the Staten Island Railroad from Vanderbilt's Landing to Tompkinsville. Work on the line was not set to begin until the commissioners made their report. The SIRT filed a map of the proposed route {{in the office of the}} clerk of Richmond County, with the line passing through the lawn of Ms. Post on the North Shore of the island. On February 26, 1883, Mr. Franklin Bartlett and Mr. Clifford Bartlett, on behalf of Ms. Post, notified the court that a change of route would be demanded. The new line, after leaving Vanderbilt's Landing, crossed the property formerly occupied by the Seaman's Retreat, but since acquired by the state by the Marine Society, then through the property of the New York Coast Wrecking Company, the lumber yards of C. C. Eddy & Sons, the carriage factory of J. Scott, the Schaeffer grounds, property represented by Coudert brothers, the grounds of George Bechtel, Rubsnin & Horrman, the brewers; S. L. Mulford & Co.'s coal and <b>wood</b> <b>yard,</b> and lands of Samuel Barton and W. Butler Duncan. The only other building upon the line besides Scott's carriage factory is a small barn on the Schaeffer grounds. The cost of the extension was estimated to be $150,000.|$|E
500|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>yard</b> was {{featured}} on A Question of Sport, when cricketer Graham Gooch {{took part in}} the programme's [...] "Mystery Guest" [...] round. Gooch endorsed the bats made from Aldermaston willow, which were sold by Surridge. When he scored 333 runs against India at Lord's in the 1990 test season, the Turbo 333 bat, made from Aldermaston wood, was launched in his honour.|$|E
2500|$|As built, Sarah Dixon burned wood to heat its boiler, and {{relied on}} <b>wood</b> <b>yards</b> along its route to furnish the fuel.

[...] It was believed that the fire was caused by a crewman falling asleep without extinguishing his pipe. [...] No one was hurt, but Columbia was destroyed. [...] Insurance paid for $15,000 but the economic cost to the company was still severe, because the mining and rail construction business in the area was booming and every vessel was working at full capacity.|$|E

60|$|Immediately {{the long}} roll was sounded, {{and as we}} fell into line once more, expecting to see the enemy advancing, word was whispered around that Major Peter, {{scouting}} {{in the direction of}} Marlboro on the <b>Wood</b> <b>Yard</b> road, had skirmished with the Britishers, and been driven back.|$|E

50|$|The town quickly {{developed}} as an industrial centre throughout the 19th century. An iron foundry {{opened and the}} port {{developed as}} did shipyards, such as <b>Wood's</b> <b>yard</b> and Ritson's yard, which was famous for launching ships broadside into the River Ellen {{because it was not}} wide enough to allow ships to be launched the usual way. By this time, coal mines were operating all around the town - at Ellenborough, Dearham, Broughton Moor, Gilcrux and Birkby.|$|R
50|$|Andover {{was linked}} to Basingstoke and thus to London by railway when the Andover {{junction}} station was opened on 3 July 1854; this railway also linking the town to Salisbury. The town was also linked by railway to Southampton, built on {{the bed of the}} canal, but this was closed down in 1964. The land, together with the adjacent gasworks and P. M.

60|$|It {{was nearly}} noon {{when we arrived}} at {{what is known as the}} <b>Wood</b> <b>Yard,</b> where General Winder had encamped and thrown up some slight entrenchments, and where Commodore Barney was to have joined him; but now the place was deserted, save for one man whom I remembered having seen on our fleet.|$|E
60|$|A {{medical student}} {{in those days}} did not occupy the same {{position}} that he holds now. In fact, he was nothing more nor less than an apprentice to his master. He was bound to the doctor by a regular indenture.

Our troops were on the march to meet them, but in too small a body to engage. General Winder proposes to retire till he can collect them in a body. The enemy are in full march to Washington. Have the materials prepared to destroy the bridges.' That was signed with Mr. Monroe's name, lads, an' after so much, he wrote, 'You had better remove the records.' Now do you think I'm so far out of the way in sayin' that there's a good chance of our gettin' the worst of it?" ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the {{organization}} began an expansive philanthropic program that included employment bureaus, co-operative stores, medical dispensaries, distribution of clothes, women's sewing classes, Thanksgiving meals, reading rooms, fresh air camps and other establishments. During {{the advent of}} the Great Depression in the 1930s, Volunteers of America mobilized to assist the millions of people who were unemployed, hungry and homeless. Relief efforts included employment bureaus, <b>wood</b> <b>yards,</b> soup kitchens and “Penny Pantries” where every food item cost one cent.|$|R
60|$|Clothes {{had been}} bought for the twelve sailors engaged by Medart and Rouget. The fireballs had been {{prepared}} in the cabin of the fishing boat.

6000|$|... "Ay, when my force comes up. There is no {{question}} but that the enemy is making the attack on our flotilla to cover his designs on Washington. He can have the fleet if he comes thus far. I hope by daylight {{to be on the}} march for the <b>Wood</b> <b>Yard,</b> where Winder is encamped, and count to take with me all the men that can be spared, for force enough will be left behind to destroy the fleet in case the enemy appears. Lieutenant Frazier is {{to be in charge of}} those who remain here, and you will act as his second in command. This is my plan: You shall have seventy men or more, and as soon as we leave you will make every craft ready for the torch; see to it that there are combustibles on board in sufficient quantity to insure a clean job when fire is applied. After that has been done, you will wait for the British. Once it becomes certain that you cannot save the fleet, start your fires, and put out for the American army, which will likely be near Washington by that time." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1864 two Confederate prisoners, Wash (Washington) Barker and Pomp Dennis, were paroled and {{released}} at Liberty, Missouri {{to the owner}} of a steamboat bound up the Missouri for the Montana goldfields. Steamboats had to make frequent refueling stops for wood to heat the boilers, but from Yankton, Dakota Territory to Fort Benton, Montana Territory (a distance of well over a thousand river miles), hostile Indians controlled most of the country. The Indians had burned the few existing <b>wood</b> <b>yards</b> and steamboats had to stop and cut wood as they went. Rebel soldiers like Barker and Dennis could work their way to the Montana Territory, by chopping fuel along the way.|$|R

50|$|Several {{families}} figure highly in Swanwick's long history. The Turners, {{beginning with}} George Turner in 1620, owned the local mineral rights and became coal magnates, until {{the death of}} Charles Turner in 1736. John Turner built Swanwick Hall around 1690. Elizabeth Turner had a school built in 1740 to provide education for 20 children from poor families. The school house is now a private residence. The other most significant family was the Woods, who occupied the original Swanwick Hall ('The Old Hall') in {{what is known as}} <b>Wood's</b> <b>Yard.</b> It was a substantial yeoman's residence of 1678, as evidenced by a datestone high up on the dormer gables, along Derbyshire County Council having bought it two years earlier after the death of Hugo Wood.|$|R
