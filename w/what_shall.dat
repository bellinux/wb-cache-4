25|$|His writing focus, {{as well as}} {{the focus}} of his life, turned to the problem of opium addiction. He {{described}} this as “one of my life’s ruling passions — a very agony of seeking to find — any means of bringing the habituated opium-eater out of his horrible bondage, without, or comparatively without, pain.” His essay <b>What</b> <b>Shall</b> They Do to be Saved from Harper’s was included in the 1868 book (written by Horace Day, himself a recovering addict) The Opium Habit, one of the first books to deal in a medical way with opium addiction, which had become a national crisis {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Ludlow expanded on his original essay with Outlines of the Opium Cure, a portrait in words of an ideal, perhaps utopian, drug addiction treatment clinic.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes. The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs. Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag. The ACLU supported their {{appeal to the}} Supreme Court, but the court affirmed the conviction, in 1940. But three years later, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote [...] "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." [...] To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on Flag Day.|$|E

500|$|Sometime during August 1861, Sam Jr. {{enlisted in}} the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into melancholia. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. [...] "My heart seems almost broken... <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> I do? How shall I bear it? When I first heard the news, I thought I would lie down and die," [...] she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E
500|$|The Protector's agrarian {{policy and}} proclamations were {{inspired}} {{by a group of}} intellectuals sometimes called [...] "the commonwealth men". These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful. As one of England's major landowners, Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset. By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England. The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich, so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett's Rebellion. Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once. This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel-held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged. Two days later Kett, who had his main camp outside the city, confronted the royal army, resulting in a slaughter of over 2,000 peasants. In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts-martial which executed many rebels, perhaps up to 300. For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment, so Dudley warned them: [...] "Is there no place for pardon? ... <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> we then do? Shall we hold the plough ourselves, play the carters and labour the ground with our own hands?" ...|$|E
