25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism {{did not seem}} much more piquant or fertile than the respectable old. As it happened, in the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E
500|$|Since {{her death}} and the {{publication}} of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, A Childhood at Green Hedges, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be [...] "arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her." [...] Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as [...] "a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion".|$|E
500|$|Among the Jewish {{prisoners who}} escaped after {{setting fire to}} the camp, there were two 19-year-olds, Samuel Willenberg and Kalman Taigman, who had both arrived in 1942 and {{had been forced to}} work there under pain of death. Taigman died in 2012 and Willenberg in 2016. Taigman stated of his experience, [...] "It was hell, {{absolutely}} hell. A normal man cannot imagine how a living person could have lived through it – killers, natural-born killers, who <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> remorse just murdered every little thing." [...] Willenberg and Taigman emigrated to Israel after the war and devoted their last years to retelling the story of Treblinka. Escapees Hershl Sperling and Richard Glazar both suffered from survivor guilt syndrome and eventually killed themselves.|$|E

500|$|By the 19thcentury {{the fabric}} of the {{building}} had become badly weathered, with Charles Hiatt writing that [...] "the surface rot of the very perishable red sandstone, of which the cathedral was built, was positively unsightly" [...] and that the [...] "whole place previous to restoration struck one as woebegone and neglected; it perpetually seemed to hover on the verge of collapse, and yet was <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> the romance of the average ruin". Between 1818 and 1820 the architect Thomas Harrison restored the south transept, adding corner turrets. This part of the building served until 1881 as the parish church of StOswald, and it was ecclesiastically separate. From 1844 R.C.Hussey carried out a limited restoration including work {{on the south side of}} the nave.|$|E
500|$|In his 1958 New York Times review, Crowther {{writes that}} Pather Panchali delicately {{illustrates}} how [...] "poverty {{does not always}} nullify love" [...] and how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world. Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both {{the young and the}} old die. Seton writes of the film's [...] "lyrical" [...] qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of [...] "lyrical happiness" [...] in the film, and states that Pather Panchali is [...] "about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> condescension or inflated sentiment".|$|E
500|$|J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{author of}} , commented that [...] "the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply {{sounds like a}} silly {{innocent}} romp until you realize what she's {{going on and on}} is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!". The author also felt Madonna sang with [...] "just a little too much authority". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it [...] "a comic hymn to spanking". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a [...] "double entendre-laden hit". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a [...] "fake period piece" [...] but praising its [...] "risqué s" [...] sound as [...] "all her". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside [...] "Cry Baby" [...] and [...] "I'm Going Bananas", was one of the [...] "more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> disco" [...] on the album. He also noted that [...] "its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour." [...] People magazine called it a [...] "paean to kink". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it [...] "goofy (but catchy!)".|$|E

500|$|Writing in 2009 {{with regard}} to Warnings lackluster {{commercial}} performance, James Montgomery of MTV News called the record [...] "unjustly overlooked" [...] and applauded Armstrong's [...] "super strong" [...] songwriting on the album. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rolling Stone journalist Nick Catucci gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and wrote that the band [...] "fully focus on the textures that have always differentiated their sturdy grooves and simple melodies". Catucci called the songs [...] "speedy, neatly packaged reinterpretations of pop-rock history, from the Beatles to Creedence Clearwater Revival to the Ramones themselves". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it [...] "gleeful, unabashed fun" [...] and complimented Green Day for [...] "embracing their fondness for pop and making the best damn album they'd ever made". Erlewine expressed that the band displays [...] "melodic ingenuity and imaginative arrangements" [...] and elaborated on its musical significance, stating [...] "Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, doing it all <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> self-consciousness. It's the first great pure pop album of the new millennium". Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine cited it as [...] "the most influential album on the British pop landscape since 1996 (Spice, naturally)", noting it as a significant influence on [...] "the two biggest bands in the UK at the moment, and indeed for the past few years, Busted and McFly". Passantino called Warning [...] "a great album" [...] and viewed that Green Day [...] "seemed to be bored with their genre-medium, but simultaneously knowledgeable that any attempt to boundary-hop will end with them falling on their face".|$|E

Mr. Gallagher is too modest, and too ironic, to tout his own accomplishments, so I'll do it for him: He is a classic representative of the U.S. military, a force that imposed its will, both physical and moral, to shatter al Qaeda." ...|$|E

USA Today described Boam as [...] "low-key", and The New York Times called him [...] "a polite, soft-spoken family man <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> the frenzied energy of his films." [...] Film critic Christopher Hicks said that Boam could be unusually candid, but that [...] "Boam is simply Boam [...] a reclusive writer rather than a celebrity worried about his image. And {{what you see is}} what you get, if perhaps a bit outspoken and opinionated." [...] He died on January 24, 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{several years}} after leaving Sun News, former senior anchor Theo Caldwell wrote of the station's output that [...] "the {{finished}} product was lousy television, even by Canadian standards." [...] He also complained {{that he was not}} being paid, despite his contract, and finally quit as a result. Caldwell described management's view on mandatory carriage as [...] "hypocritical". [...] "At first, when they imagined the station would be a blockbuster success, they [...] mocked the very idea of mandatory carriage. When it became clear, however, that no amount of Suzuki-bashing and Justin Trudeau prizefights could save the enterprise, they insisted it was unfair not to grant Sun a guaranteed income stream, on the risible basis that CBC and CTV had received similar treatment decades before. It wasn't honest, and it is astounding that Peladeau and Sun management could undertake such a blatant reversal <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> irony." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the coming}} of war in 1793, the need to {{eliminate}} scurvy acquired a new urgency. But the first initiative came not from the medical establishment but from the admirals. Ordered to lead an expedition against Mauritius, Rear Admiral Gardner was uninterested in the wort, malt and elixir of vitriol which were still being issued to ships of the Royal Navy, and demanded that he be supplied with lemons, to counteract scurvy on the voyage. [...] Members of the Sick and Hurt Board, recently augmented by two practical naval surgeons, supported the request, and the Admiralty ordered that it be done. [...] There was, however, a last minute change of plan. The expedition against Mauritius was cancelled. [...] On 2 May 1794, only HMS Suffolk and two sloops under Commodore Peter Rainier sailed for the east with an outward bound convoy, but the warships were fully supplied with lemon juice and the sugar with which {{it had to be}} mixed. Then in March 1795, came astonishing news. Suffolk had arrived in India after a four-month voyage <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> scurvy and with a crew that was healthier than when it set out.|$|E

60|$|It is not {{necessary}} to follow the steps of each.
