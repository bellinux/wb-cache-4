The city had a Protestant and unionist majority and IRA actions <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to with reprisals against the Catholic population, including killings (such as the McMahon killings) and the burning of many homes – as on Belfast's Bloody Sunday. The IRA in Belfast and the north generally, although involved in protecting the Catholic community from loyalists and state forces, undertook an arson campaign against factories and commercial premises. The violence in Belfast alone, which continued until October 1922 (long after the truce {{in the rest of}} the country), claimed the lives of between 400 and 500 people.|$|E
25|$|The Opening Ceremonies {{began with}} a {{traditional}} countdown by the spectators. Italian gymnast Yuri Chechi as a shaman striking an anvil with a hammer opened the first scene of the program representing the industrial past of the Piedmont region. Each strike spewed up a fountain of flames and <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to with flames over three metres high, lit from 52 nozzles lined up around the piazza. A group of inline skaters in red unitards soon entered and executed their choreograph and formations. With the fire, costume and flood light, the stage was soon turned into a sea of red. In the mosh pit, performers executed synchronised swimming moves to the pulsing rhythm. It was said that the choreographer was inspired by synchronised swimming {{when he saw the}} event {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.|$|E

Flight testing led to the need for minor modifications. Airflow disturbances <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to by re-profiling the engine intakes and the fuselage to minimise surging and buffeting experienced at supersonic speeds. Testing revealed that a nose-wheel steering augmentation system, connecting with the yaw damper, was necessary to counteract the destabilising effect produced by deploying the thrust reverser during landing rollouts. In August 1976, Soviet espionage activities were exposed trying to obtain information on the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of how {{behavioral}} methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a [...] "yes" [...] response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a [...] "no" [...] response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.|$|E

Such allegations <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to by the Peasant Party's Ion Pelivan, who wrote the newspaper to argue that Romania's intervention had first of all restored [...] "liberty and democracy" [...] in Bessarabia, and that the union expressed [...] "the free will of the Bessarabian populace, with no outside intervention."

2500|$|A common {{behavioral}} paradigm involves priming effects, wherein {{participants are}} presented {{first with a}} prime {{and then with a}} target word. [...] The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target. [...] For example, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. She asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a [...] "yes" [...] response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a [...] "no" [...] response.

2500|$|The Victorian critic John Ruskin, {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, {{provided}} short analyses of various writers in his [...] "Nature and Literature" [...] essays collected in [...] "Art and Life: a Ruskin Anthology". In speaking of Wordsworth, Ruskin claimed, [...] "Wordsworth is simply a Westmoreland peasant, with considerably less shrewdness than most border Englishmen or Scotsmen inherit; and no sense of humor; but gifted... with vivid sense of natural beauty, and a pretty turn for reflection, not always acute, but, as far as they reach, medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around him." [...] After mocking the self-reflective nature of Wordsworth's poetry, he then declared that the poetry was [...] "Tuneful nevertheless at heart, and of the heavenly choir, I gladly and frankly acknowledge him; and our English literature enriched with a new and singular virtue in the aerial purity and healthful rightness of his quiet song;—but aerial only—not ethereal; and lowly in its privacy of light". The ode, to Ruskin, becomes a means to deride Wordsworth's intellect and faith when he claims that Wordsworth was [...] "content with intimations of immortality such as may be in skipping of lambs, and laughter of children-incurious to see in the hands the print of the nails." [...] Ruskin's claims <b>were</b> <b>responded</b> to by an article by Richard Hutton in the 7 August 1880 Spectator. The article, [...] "Mr. Ruskin on Wordsworth", stated, [...] "We should hardly have expected Mr. Ruskin—a great master of irony though he be—to lay his finger so unerringly as he does on the weak point of Wordsworth's sublime ode on the 'Intimations of Immortality,' when he speaks of him—quite falsely, by the way—as 'content with intimations of immortality'". The article continued with praise of Wordsworth and condemns Ruskin further: [...] "But then, though he shows how little he understands the ode, in speaking of Wordsworth as content with such intimations, he undoubtedly does touch the weak chord in what, but for that weak chord, would be one of the greatest of all monuments of human genius... But any one to whom Wordsworth's great ode is the very core of that body of poetry which makes up the best part of his imaginative life, will be as much astonished to find Mr. Ruskin speaking of it so blindly and unmeaningly as he does".|$|E
