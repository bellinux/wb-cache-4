Damjanovič immediately placed himself and the remaining 6,500 troops of the SDS under Mihailović's command. The SDS was then renamed the [...] "Serbian Shock Corps (Srpski udarni korpus or SUK) of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland" [...] once again under the command of Radovanović and it joined the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Chetnik formations towards the Sandžak region then into northeastern Bosnia.

50|$|When {{it first}} opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based {{ticketing}} system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors {{on board the}} trams.

This process was completed on 1 August 2016.|$|R
50|$|For {{five days}} Maczek’s brigade {{effectively}} slowed the German advance. Despite numerical and technical superiority, the German units' daily gain {{was no more}} than 10 kilometres. Polish soldiers took advantage of difficult, mountainous terrain, stopping German attacks and occasionally counter-attacking. However, after the front of the Kraków Army was broken to the north of brigade's position, it was pulled out from the front line. The brigade then fought as a screening unit, defending the bridges and fords in Lesser Poland, until it arrived in Lwów and joined the city’s defenders. The unit was to be formed into a mobile reserve during the battle for Lwów to facilitate the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Polish units towards the Romanian Bridgehead. However, the plan was made obsolete by the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union on September 17. After two days, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Marshal of Poland ordered the brigade to cross the Hungarian border.|$|R

Daniels drew 29.33% of the vote, besting second place {{finisher}} Mitt Romney (22.66%) and third place finisher Sarah Palin (18.22%), and {{was the winner}} of a similar straw poll {{in the state of}} Washington. On May 5, 2011, Daniels told an interviewer that he would announce [...] "within weeks" [...] his decision of whether or not to run for the Republican presidential nomination. He said he felt he was not prepared to debate on all the national issues, like foreign policy, and needed time to better understand the issues and put together formal positions. Later in May, as the Republican field began to resolve with announcements and <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> candidates, Time said, [...] "Even setting aside his somewhat unusual family situation, Daniels would need to hurry to put together an organization" [...] and raise enough money if he intended to run.|$|R

5|$|Broad {{interest}} in metformin was not rekindled until the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, {{but did not}} receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on March 3, 1995. Generic formulations are now available in several countries, and metformin {{is believed to have}} become the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug.|$|R
60|$|So {{the ladies}} passed out in single file; Mr Jefferson Brick and such other married gentlemen as were left, {{acknowledging}} the departure <b>of</b> their <b>other</b> halves by a nod; {{and there was}} an end of THEM. Martin thought this an uncomfortable custom, but he kept his opinion to himself for the present, being anxious to hear, and inform himself by, the conversation of the busy gentlemen, who now lounged about the stove as if a great weight had been taken off their minds by the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> sex; and who made a plentiful use of the spittoons and their toothpicks.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{announced}} {{a far more}} radical series of reforms intended to simplify the benefits and tax credits scheme into a single payment {{to be known as}} Universal Credit. A major aim of welfare reform was to ensure that low earners would always be better off in employment. [...] "After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair," [...] said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system that would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised [...] "targeted work activity for those who need {{to get used to the}} habits of work" [...] and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who [...] "play by the rules" [...] and ensure [...] "work always pays more" [...] by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2005-06 season, Tarasova {{returned}} to Russia and so Griazev did as well, training with both Tarasova and Elena Vodorezova in Moscow. Griazev was 9th out of 11 {{men at the}} 2005 Skate Canada International. The very next week, however, he won the bronze medal at 2005 Cup of China, his first senior Grand Prix medal. At that competition, {{he was in the}} lead after the short program, and earned new personal best scores for his short program, long program, and overall total. At the 2006 Russian nationals, Griazev finished 9th and did not receive a berth to the European Championships and the Olympics. Due to the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> skaters, Griazev was sent to 2006 Worlds, where he struggled in the qualifying and short programs, but performed a strong long program. Griazev {{returned to}} Russia in March 2006 {{to take part in the}} Italian Carnival skating tour produced by Ilia Averbukh. He had also taken part in this tour the previous year. His touring schedule was cut short when he sustained a knee injury and had to undergo surgery.|$|R

50|$|Autism rates {{continued}} to rise in Japan after the discontinuation of the MMR vaccine, which disproves any large-scale effect of vaccination, and means that the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> MMR in <b>other</b> countries is unlikely to cause a reduction in autism cases.

50|$|In the 1886 {{identification}} system the goods locos were classed V but engine No. 12 remained unclassed. Eventually both numbers 12 and 13 were sold, No. 12 to the Yarrawonga Council {{for use on}} the Katamatite tramway, then bought back and renumbered because other engines had taken their numbers in the meantime. Numbers 12 and 13 became numbers 528 and 497. No 11 was taken off register in May 1891 when it was sold to contractor Andrew O'Keefe for $2700. <b>Withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> four took place in 1904 with the last No 15 being withdrawn on the 13 September.|$|R
50|$|December 16 dawned, a foggy, and gloomy morning. Exhausted by midmorning, the Florida Brigade had labored {{through the}} night digging entrenchments {{on the slopes of}} Compton’s Hill;despite this frantic pace, the works were not completed. During the night, General Bate had placed his {{division}} on the northwestern face of the hill, with the Florida Brigade occupying his center. General Mark Lowrey’s troops connected with Bate’s left, while General Edward Walthall’s Division held the right slopes of the hill. Because Cheatham’s Corps ran due south and A. P. Stewart’s line jogged in a southeastern, and then easterly from Compton’s Hill, the position presented a protruding salient. Furthermore, their entrenchments mirrored those constructed on Missionary Ridge, in that they “were constructed too far back, along the actual crown of the hill rather than on the forward slopes.” To make matters even worse, Bate’s three brigades’sdefensive lines were thinned when these units were forced to extend to fill gaps caused by the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> troops from the hill. Like the engagement in the cedars at Murfreesboro a week earlier, the Floridians were placed in a precarious position from which their superiors expected the impossible.|$|R
40|$|Ceftriaxone (a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic) {{has recently}} been identified as having the rare ability to increase the expression and functional activity of the glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT- 1) in rat spinal cord cultures. GLT- 1 has been implicated in diverse neurological disorders and in opioid dependence and withdrawal. It has been speculated that {{it might also be}} involved in the physical dependence and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> abused drugs, but demonstration of this property can be difficult in mammalian models. Here, we demonstrate for the first time using a planarian model that ceftriaxone attenuates both the development of physical dependence and abstinence-induced withdrawal from cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and a benzodiazepine (clorazepate) in a concentration-related manner. These results suggest that physical dependence and withdrawal from several drugs involve a common - beta-lactam-sensitive - mechanism in planarians. If these findings can be shown to extend to mammals, beta-lactam antibiotics might represent a novel pharmacotherapy or adjunct approach for treating drug abuse or serve as a template for drug discovery efforts aimed at treating drug abuse, recovery from drug abuse, or ameliorating the withdrawal from chronic use of therapeutic medications...|$|R
