In this type of configuration it is actually two concentric bands of non-magnetic conductor material. There is one gap in each band placed 180° relative to each other. The gap in each band gives it the distinctive [...] "C" [...] shape, rather than a totally circular or square shape. Then multiple cells of this double band configuration are fabricated onto circuit board material by an etching technique and lined with copper <b>wire</b> <b>strip</b> arrays are added.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{design of}} a {{rectangular}} microstrip patch antenna loaded with DNG metamaterial has been proposed. This antenna provides tetra-band resonance all falling between 4 GHz and 9 GHz. The DNG metamaterial property has been achieved using rectangular SRRs (Split Ring Resonators) and a <b>wire</b> <b>strip.</b> The performance of the proposed antenna was analyzed by simulation results. In order to demonstrate the impact of presence of DNG metamaterial in the proposed antenna, another simple rectangular patch antenna was designed by removing the DNG (Double negative) metamaterial from the proposed antenna structure but keeping the dimension and materials of other elements same. Simulations were run to analyze the performance of this new antenna as well. And this new antenna provides dual-band resonance instead of tetra-band. Comparison between the new rectangular microstrip patch antenna and the proposed antenna demonstrates the impact of loading metamaterial in antenna structure. It has been successfully illustrated here {{that the use of}} metamaterial makes antenna a better resonator...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking capacity short-circuit test plus the application of crow-bar, Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform wire fuse elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single <b>wire,</b> <b>strip,</b> long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high quality granular quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the burn-back are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B. C. fuse behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Flexible pipes with helical {{reinforcement}} {{are widely}} used in the marine engineering and tissue engineering because of their low bending stiffness.

All studies {{on this kind of}} structures regard the pitch angle of helical <b>wires,</b> <b>strips</b> or fibers as a vital parameter influencing the mechanical properties. In this study, we compare the tensile property of pipes with helical reinforcements braided in different initial pitch angles. Contact pressure is taken into consideration and eliminated by using deformation compatibility equation. The pitch angle changes under axial tension which induces the geometric nonlinearity. It is noted that when the pitch angle is larger than a critical value, even if there is no internal or external pressure, helixes will contact with the core under axial tension. But the initial pitch angle can not be too large since the contact pressure will induce partial buckling of the flexible pipe...|$|R
