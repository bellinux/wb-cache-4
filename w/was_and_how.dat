The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E

25|$|In {{previous}} years a complicated system of points allocation was used, {{depending on how}} strong the opponent <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> large the loss margin, which allowed weaker losing teams to gain points when playing a much stronger opposition, if they managed {{to put up a}} decent match. With the new system, the points allocation is simpler: three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss, in line with most league systems around the world.|$|E
25|$|Many {{religious}} traditions {{have taken a}} stance on abortion, and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below. Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> grave a sin it was held to be, it was seen as at least as grave as sexual immorality. Some early Christians believed that the embryo {{did not have a}} soul from conception, and consequently, opinion was divided {{as to whether or not}} early abortion was murder or ethically equivalent to murder.|$|E

25|$|In April 1940, Popular Science {{showed an}} example of a radar unit using the Watson-Watt patent in an article on air defence. Also, in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a U.S. {{scientist}} speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> it worked. Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Alfred Lee Loomis organized the Radiation Laboratory at Cambridge, Massachusetts which developed the technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the monopulse technique that was used for many years in most radar applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of Gil-galad is {{somewhat}} obscure, as Tolkien himself repeatedly {{changed his mind about}} who exactly Gil-galad <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to fit him into the already existing history of the First Age (see concept and creation, below). Gil-galad was certainly born in Beleriand {{at some point during the}} First Age. He was perhaps at some point sent to live in the Falas with Círdan the Shipwright, but this is unclear; certainly after the fall of Nargothrond he was living on the Isle of Balar with Círdan, and became the last High King of the Noldor following the fall of Gondolin and the death of Turgon. Gil-galad, despite his long life (he was born during the First Age and lived through almost the entirety of the Second), was not known to have a wife, nor any children. Due to this, and the fact that there were few Noldor remaining in Middle-earth, the title of High King of the Noldor in Exile ended with his death.|$|E
25|$|It {{is highly}} likely that Eggestein even {{travelled}} to Mainz {{himself in the}} 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. Ferdinand Geldner holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might be why he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, then he could have watched the printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the Türkenkalender, which was completed {{in the middle of}} December in 1454. He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust.|$|E

25|$|Castleford {{where the}} winner would reach the final. 3,000 people turned up to first see Thompson score a penalty after 15 minutes, but then Nigere Tariu slid over {{to put the}} Islanders ahead. Just before the break however, Tait charged through three players to put Scotland back in the game. In the second half the Cook Islands, with several NRL players in their ranks, showed their {{strength}} as Sonny Shepherd scored a controversial try as Scottish players complained about the grounding. From a play the ball Shepherd went over again and in the 73rd minute Tariu scored a converted try. The Bravehearts did get a late consolation, skipper Tait going over for Scotland's last try before Islander Ali Davys sealed Scotland's fate with a drop-goal. The match finished Scotland 10–21 Cook Islands. In the final the Cook Islands beat Ireland 22–6 in Bury to win the tournament and secure {{a place in the}} next World Cup. Despite losing this final match the Scotland team and supporters thought that they had done very well considering how young the team <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> well their performances had been against Russia and the USA.|$|E

Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we suddenly had a lot of so-called experts telling us how it really <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> we were wrong".

500|$|... "Rebel Heart" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Pettifer also wrote that the lyrics were [...] "more auto-biographical and therefore more interesting". Bradley Stern, an editor and publisher for MuuMuse, also praised the song's autobiographical lyrics; [...] "The message is sincere, vulnerable and undoubtedly true to Madonna’s story, the music is strong and that chorus is utterly anthemic. Madonna hasn’t had a truly rich, singer-songwriter, sing-along friendly record in a while— maybe since Music?— so it's kind of unbelievable to hear such a strong melody from the Queen again". He called it [...] "one of her best songs in a long time". Stern preferred the leaked demo over the final original version.|$|E

Sakamoto also said the game would [...] "bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe", and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans.

During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest. Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was.
