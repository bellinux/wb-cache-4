5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds {{these two}} moral {{theories}} very limiting {{because they are}} quandary ethics, cases that rely on extreme situations. He believes {{that there needs to}} be a third reasoning that falls somewhere in between these two. He believes that the basic doctor-patient relationship should be built on trust and caring. This characterizes him as more of deontological thinker; however, he does believe in research on human beings. Hauerwas’s perspective is {{that there needs to be}} a middle ground between these two perspectives. The patient becomes dehumanized through research; however, without this research there would be little medical improvement. Hauerwas therefore believes this middle ground should focus on caring for the patient instead of curing. With this, Hauerwas believes <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> moral understanding to handle current medicine.|$|E

2500|$|Sustained {{increases}} in U.S. troop levels would {{not solve the}} fundamental cause of violence in Iraq, which {{is the absence of}} national reconciliation. A senior American general told us that adding U.S. troops might temporarily help limit violence in a highly localized area. However, past experience indicates that the violence would simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are moved to another area. As another American general told us, if the Iraqi government does not make political progress, [...] "all the troops in the world will not provide security." [...] Meanwhile, America's military capacity is stretched thin: <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> troops or equipment to make a substantial, sustained increase in our troop presence. Increased deployments to Iraq would also necessarily hamper our ability to provide adequate resources for our efforts in Afghanistan or respond to crises around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have never said that the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine said, was that the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> slightest doubt that God will bring it about ... {{we have to wait}} and see exactly when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{after the}} {{coalition}} invasion of Iraq had been launched, but prior to troops arriving in Baghdad, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Parliament of the United Kingdom that the United States and the United Kingdom {{believed they had}} [...] "sufficient forces" [...] in Iraq. At that very time Ritter offered an opposing view on Portuguese radio station TSF: [...] "The United States is going to leave Iraq with its tail between its legs, defeated. It is a war we can not win... <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> military means to take over Baghdad {{and for this reason}} I believe the defeat of the United States in this war is inevitable... Every time we confront Iraqi troops we may win some tactical battles, as we did for ten years in Vietnam, but {{we will not be able}} to win this war, which in my opinion is already lost," [...] Ritter added.|$|E

Right now in Natanz we have the {{capability}} to enrich at over 20 per cent and at over 80 per cent, but because we don't need it, we won't do it." [...] He added [...] "If we wanted to manufacture a bomb, we would announce it." [...] On the same day as the President's announcement, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters that their 20% enrichment production, was going [...] "very well," [...] adding [...] "There is no limit on enrichment. We can enrich up to 100%... But we never had the intention and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> intention to do so, unless we need (to)." [...] He maintained that the 20% production was for a Tehran medical reactor, and as such would be limited to around 1.5kg per month.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{acknowledged}} {{that one might}} ask: Since God knows everything that will occur before it comes to pass, does God not know whether a person will be righteous or wicked? And if God knows that a person will be righteous, it would appear impossible for that person not to be righteous. However, if one would say that despite God's knowledge that the person would be righteous {{it is possible for}} the person to be wicked, then God's knowledge would be incomplete. Maimonides taught that just as it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's essential nature, as [...] says, [...] "No man will perceive Me and live," [...] so, too, it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's knowledge. This was what Isaiah intended when [...] says, [...] "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways, My ways." [...] Accordingly, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to conceive how God knows all the creations and their deeds. But Maimonides said that it is without doubt that people's actions are in their own hands and God does not decree them. Consequently, the prophets taught that people are judged according to their deeds.|$|E
2500|$|Disrupted {{healthcare}} sectors is a {{term the}} World Health Organization describes for medical facilities that are destroyed or partially destroyed in war torn areas. Health care facilities are essential {{for the establishment of}} support systems for rape victims. Psychological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners and health-care workers face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area. As the WHO explains, [...] "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses". War-torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences." [...] Access to phycological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape who are at the margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions. Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 1984 NFL owners {{voted to}} give Irsay {{permission}} {{to move his}} franchise {{to the city of}} his choosing. Irsay continued discussions with several cities hungry for an NFL franchise (New York City, Phoenix, Arizona, Indianapolis, Indiana, Birmingham, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee) eventually narrowing the list of cities to two, Phoenix and Indianapolis. In January 1984, Baltimore's mayor Schaefer stated, [...] "We're not going to build a new stadium. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> bonding capacity. We don't have the voters or taxpayer who can support a $60 million stadium. One-third of the people in Baltimore pay taxes. Unless private enterprise builds it, we won't build it." [...] The Phoenix Metropolitan Sports Foundation, headed by real estate developer Eddie Lynch, along with Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt and other top Arizona officials, had secretly met with Irsay early in January 1984. Preliminary talks seemed promising. Phoenix was offering a below market rate $15 million loan and rent-free use of the 71,000 seat Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University. (Sun Devil Stadium would later serve as the home to the Arizona Cardinals from 1988 to 2005 after the team moved there from St. Louis, Missouri; that team has since moved into University of Phoenix Stadium within that market.) A second meeting was scheduled between Irsay and the Phoenix group. But when word of a second scheduled meeting leaked out and was reported by the media on the Friday before the Super Bowl, Irsay canceled. Meanwhile, Indianapolis and local real estate developer Robert Welch, were lobbying the NFL to bring an expansion team to the city, with Welch as team owner. Welch also had personal discussions with New Orleans Saints owner John Mecom about buying the team and moving it to Indianapolis.|$|E
60|$|There are {{two other}} odd and rather {{important}} things {{to be said about}} them. The first is this: that with this aristocracy <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chance of a lucky variety in types which belongs to larger and looser aristocracies. The moderately rich include all kinds of people even good people. Even priests are sometimes saints; and even soldiers are sometimes heroes. Some doctors have really grown wealthy by curing their patients and not by flattering them; some brewers have been known to sell beer. But among the Very Rich you will never find a really generous man, even by accident. They may give their money away, but they will never give themselves away; they are egoistic, secretive, dry as old bones. To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it.|$|E
