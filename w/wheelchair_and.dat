5|$|Although a {{one-shot}}, {{the events}} of The Killing Joke were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in the Birds of Prey series, {{she was in a}} <b>wheelchair</b> <b>and</b> became the computer hacker Oracle (this series was later adapted into a TV series of the same title). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, , involving the Joker murdering Robin (Jason Todd), The Killing Joke, leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later, Stephanie Brown. Gordon's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three yearsin DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, The New 52, which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, an Italian {{promoter}} {{encouraged the}} original Pentangle to reform {{for a tour}} and a new album. The reunion started badly, with Terry Cox being injured in a car accident, resulting in the band's debuting at the Cambridge Folk Festival as a four-piece Pentangle. They managed to complete a tour of Italy (with Cox in a <b>wheelchair)</b> <b>and</b> Australia, before Renbourn left the band in 1983. There then followed a series of personnel changes, including Mike Piggott replacing John Renbourn from 1983 to 1987 and recording Open the Door and In the Round, but ultimately leaving Jansch and McShee as the only original members. The final incarnation consisting of Jansch, McShee, Nigel Portman Smith (keyboards), Peter Kirtley (guitar and vocals) and Gerry Conway (drums) survived from 1987 to 1995 and recorded three albums: Think of Tomorrow, One More Road and Live 1994.

5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the eight}} sports contested in the first Paralympics, the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome. Both the rules for the sport and for the {{approval}} of swimmers' classifications were set by the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA). In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) formally became the governing body for disability swimming. Four different sporting bodies, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD), International <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>and</b> Amputee Sports Federation (ISMWSF) and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC Classification Code and IPC Swimming govern the classification process. Classification of swimmers is performed by classifiers that are recognised by the IPC.|$|E

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his <b>wheelchair,</b> <b>and</b> crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E

This national study is the first to investigate Veterans Health Administration costs in providing <b>wheelchairs</b> <b>and</b> scooters and to compare regional prescription patterns. With a retrospective design, we used descriptive methods to analyze fiscal years 2000 and 2001 National Prosthetics Patient Database data (cleaned data set of 113, 724 records). Wheelchairs were categorized by function, weight, and adjustability options for meeting individual needs (e. g., axle position, camber, position of wheels, tilt, and recline options). Results displayed a cost distribution that was negatively skewed by low-cost accessories coded as wheelchairs. Of the standard manual wheelchairs, 3. 5 % could be considered beyond the customary cost. Regionally, 71 % to 86 % of all wheelchairs provided were manual wheelchairs, 5 % to 11 % were power <b>wheelchairs,</b> <b>and</b> 5 % to 20 % were scooters. The considerable variation found in the types of <b>wheelchairs</b> <b>and</b> scooters provided across Veterans Integrated Service Networks may indicate a need for evidence-based prescription guidelines and clinician training in wheeled-mobility technologies...|$|R
