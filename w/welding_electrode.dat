5000|$|On 27 June 1908, the Swede Oscar Kjellberg {{received}} German Imperial patent no. 231733 [...] "Electrode {{and procedure}} for electrical soldering" [...] {{and is therefore}} recognised as {{the inventor of the}} coated <b>welding</b> <b>electrode.</b>|$|E

5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|R

50|$|He also co-invented an {{automated}} welding machine for {{the closure of}} nuclear fuel pins by {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW also known as TIG welding), in which a rotating length of cladding was positioned adjacent to a <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> in a sealed enclosure. An independently movable axial grinder was provided in the enclosure for refurbishing the used electrode between welds.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawn arc}} can be {{initiated}} by two electrodes initially in contact and drawn apart; this can initiate an arc without the high-voltage glow discharge. This {{is the way}} a welder starts to weld a joint, momentarily touching the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> against the workpiece then withdrawing it till a stable arc is formed. Another example is separation of electrical contacts in switches, relays or circuit breakers; in high-energy circuits arc suppression {{may be required to}} prevent damage to contacts.|$|E
50|$|In arc welding, an {{electrode}} is used {{to conduct}} current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, {{in the case of}} gas metal arc welding or shielded metal arc welding, or non-consumable, such as in gas tungsten arc welding. For a direct current system, the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current arc welder, the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> would not be considered an anode or cathode.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Oscar Kjellberg. In 1904 he pioneered the {{development}} of manual metal arc <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company sells equipment used in welding and cutting.|$|R
40|$|Abstract— <b>Welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> are metal wires with {{chemical}} coatings. It {{is widely used}} in arc welding process. The metal rod is used to sustain the welding arc and to provide the filler metal required for the joint to be welded. The coating protects the metal from damage due to oxidation, stabilizes the arc, and improves the weld. Our paper {{is concerned with the}} design and fabrication of manually operated device that produces such <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> It follows the extrusion principle and screw conveyor concept. It is done by passing the electrode and the flux material through a die. It is a simple setup from which electrodes can be manufactured easily...|$|R
50|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as general manager}} of the company ESAB, in 1921 Kjellberg established Kjellberg Elektroden GmbH in Berlin together with six German and Swedish partners, for the purpose of manufacturing and marketing the patented <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> For lack of suitable power sources and at Oscar Kjellberg’s suggestion, Kjellberg Elektro-Maschinen GmbH was established in Finsterwalde in 1922. In 1923, the company's first welding generator developed and built in Finsterwalde, Ke 200/1450, was presented at the Leipzig spring fair. Later that year, the production of <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> started in Finsterwalde. The oldest product was the rod electrode OK G2/1, which was used for repair welding.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{determined}} searching strategy, the electric contact sensor systems are scanning the weld start or other track points via contacting {{the work piece}} with parts/components which {{have been subjected to}} voltage (direct voltage of several ten Volt up to 1 KV, depending on material and surface) of the welding equipment (shielding gas nozzle, <b>welding</b> <b>electrode,</b> stylus, or similar.) This means the offline-measuring of the weld start, the part position or part geometry before welding. Knowing the scheduled path, a transformation of the track points in accordance with the measured conditions is carried out. In this case, corrective action is not carried out during the welding process.|$|E
50|$|According to the government's {{official}} {{explanation of}} the disaster, the repair crews discovered that the catastrophe had been caused by a faulty welding incident during initial construction. They discovered that during installation of the primary cooling system piping, a welder had failed to cover exposed pipe surfaces with asbestos drop cloths (required to protect piping systems from accidental exposure to welding sparks), due to the cramped working space. A drop from a <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> fell on an unprotected surface, producing an invisible crack. This crack was subject to prolonged and intensive pressure (over 200 atmospheres), compromising the pipe's integrity and finally causing it to fail.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{spot welder}} {{consists}} of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding electrodes {{are part of the}} transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage or current.|$|E
50|$|Kjellberg Finsterwalde {{manufactures}} {{plasma cutting}} technology (up to 600 A), automatic welding machines and <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> for industrial purposes, {{with part of}} the products customised. For example, Kjellberg equipment {{is used in the}} shipbuilding, automotive and plant construction industries.|$|R

50|$|Stranded wire is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small wires bundled or wrapped together to form a larger conductor. Stranded wire is more flexible than solid wire of the same total cross-sectional area. Stranded wire tends to be a better conductor than solid wire because the individual wires collectively comprise a greater surface area. Stranded wire is used when higher resistance to metal fatigue is required. Such situations include connections between circuit boards in multi-printed-circuit-board devices, where the rigidity of solid wire would produce too much stress as a result of movement during assembly or servicing; A.C. line cords for appliances; musical instrument cables; computer mouse cables; <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> cables; control cables connecting moving machine parts; mining machine cables; trailing machine cables; and numerous others.|$|E
5000|$|For pure substances, e.g. pure metal, pure water, etc. the {{liquidus}} and solidus are at {{the same}} temperature, and the term [...] "melting point" [...] may be used. For impure substances, e.g. alloys, tap water, Coca-Cola, ice cream, etc. the melting point broadens into a melting interval instead. If the temperature is within the melting interval, one may see [...] "slurries" [...] at equilibrium, i.e. the slurry will neither fully solidify nor melt. This is why new snow of high purity either melts or stays solid, while dirty {{snow on the ground}} tends to become slushy at certain temperatures. Weld melt pools containing high levels of sulfur, either from melted impurities of the base metal or from the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode,</b> typically have very broad melting intervals, which leads to increased risk of hot cracking.|$|E
5000|$|Enabling high {{performance}} optoelectronic modules using novel gas-conserving resistance <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> system - Amada Miyachi America {{developed a new}} projection welding technique that dramatically reduces the amount of Xenon gas needed to backfill a package. Xenon has good thermal properties that aid in transporting reliability-reducing heat away from the electronic device. In addition, it is an inert gas, which does not enter into slow chemical reactions with other materials {{that can be a}} root cause of degraded performance and reliability. However, it is extremely expensive, about $150 a liter and many existing processes waste significant quantities of the costly gas during backfilling. The new cap welding technique uses an innovative electrode vacuum and gas backfill system that enables packages to be evacuated, and then filled with gas before being hermetically sealed using projection welding. This process consumes as little as 5 cubic centimeters of Xenon gas, costing only $0.75 per part.|$|E
