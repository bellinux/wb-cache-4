50|$|A <b>working</b> <b>cats</b> {{program is}} {{designed}} to place cats in safe environments where they are valued for their hunting skills as <b>working</b> <b>cats.</b> These programs are typically offered by animal shelters who will use otherwise unadoptable cats in the program as an alternative to euthanasia. The cats may not be suitable for adoption because they are feral cats or did not acclimate to living in close quarters with humans. Working cats programs usually provide cats that are spayed or neutered and fully vaccinated, and any adoption fee is often waived. In exchange for their services, the cats are to receive a place to live, food, water, and vet care.|$|R
50|$|American Shorthairs are {{intelligent}} cats who {{are interested}} in their surroundings. They will watch birds, other animals and any outside activity from a window perch. These cats are calm yet playful, and some enjoy sitting in laps. They get along with children, so they make good family pets. Even though they are social cats, they are still independent. These cats continue to use their hunting skills to catch insects or pests that come into the house. The American Shorthair Cat has a very strong play/prey instinct and they should have access to toys as an important part of their development. Being that they are <b>working</b> <b>cats,</b> cat play is extremely important.|$|R

5000|$|The Snowshoe {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} cat {{originating}} in the United States of America in the 1960s. Snowshoes were first produced in Philadelphia when a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called [...] "Silver Laces", crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bi-color American Shorthair cats and other breeds. When Hinds-Daugherty left the program, Vikki Olander began <b>working</b> with the <b>cats</b> and recruited new breeders, as well as worked towards full recognition within cat associations. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due {{to the difficulty of}} reproducing the correct coat markings. The marks are based on recessive genes for color points and on the co-dominant but variably-expressed piebald pattern gene, making it difficult to predict the appearance of offspring.|$|R
40|$|By using a servo-nulling {{mechanism}} and coated glass micropipettes (20 - 24 µm OD), intramyocardial stress (IMS) was {{measured at the}} base of the left ventricle in isolated <b>working</b> and nonworking <b>cat</b> hearts, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Glass micropipettes were placed at various depths inside the left ventricular wall using a micropipette holder and manipulator. Calculation of the IMS is not a simple problem because of the complex structure of the active fibres in the myocardium. However a mathematical approach has been developed that reduces the complexity of this problem. It consists in using the concept of force per unit volume of the myocardium to model the components of the stress generated by the fibers in three orthogonal directions (assuming symmetrical contraction). Important relations are derived between the stress induced by the LVP and the stress induced by the active fibres in the passive medium of the myocardium...|$|R
5000|$|Big Star's Third {{began with}} Stamey, who had collaborated with Big Star's Alex Chilton {{in the late}} 70s. In 2005, <b>working</b> with <b>Cat's</b> Cradle owner Frank Heath, Stamey {{recruited}} a group of musicians for a performance of Elliot Smith's Either/Or. Several weeks later, Heath and Stamey discussed a performance of Third/Sister Lovers using a similar model. Stamey subsequently tracked down Carl Marsh, who had orchestrated Third/Sister Lovers. Marsh volunteered to write out the scores to replace the originals, which had been lost, but needed the original multitracked recordings of the album to do so. Five years later, at Heath's urging, Stamey spoke to John Fry at Ardent Studios, where Third/Sister Lovers was recorded. Fry agreed to make some of the original multitracks available so that the written music could be accurately rewritten, and the unwritten parts deciphered, and, after speaking to Stephens -- who then managed Ardent Studios -- Stamey planned a trip to discuss the project with the reconfigured Big Star, who were rehearsing for a SXSW performance. The night before the meeting, on March 17, 2010, Chilton {{died of a heart}} attack. [...] With the support of Chilton's widow, Stephens, and Ardent, the plans for the Third/Sister Lovers concert moved forward. The inaugural performance of Big Star's Third took place on December 10th at the Cat's Cradle, with Stephens on drums, Mills on bass, and Easter and Stamey on guitar. Additional musicians included nine singers, a seven-piece string section, and five brass and woodwind players.|$|R
500|$|For scenes {{showing the}} {{exterior}} of the Nostromo, a [...] landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott was not convinced that it looked large enough, so he had his two young sons and the son of Derek Vanlint (the film's cinematographer) stand in for the regular actors, wearing smaller space suits to make the set-pieces seem larger. The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits; oxygen systems were eventually added to help the actors breathe. Four identical cats were used to portray Jones, the crew's pet. During filming, Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was allergic to the combination of cat hair and the glycerin placed on the actors' skin to make them appear sweaty.

40|$|Today {{there are}} over 100 000 stray cats in Sweden and of these 10 000 are found in Gothenburg. There are several {{instances}} that try {{to reduce the number}} of stray cats. The problem for stray cats is primarily the suffering they may face in hunger, cold, predators, diseases, parasites, accidents, etc. The cats receive no veterinary care and may die from a simple infection that easily can be cured with antibiotics. Stray cats also can spread diseases to domestic cats, be a sanitary problem and compete with other small predators on prey. Authorities <b>working</b> with stray <b>cats</b> are the Country Administrative Board and the police authority. However, it is mostly non-profit organizations and shelters that are trying to give these cats new homes. Some organizations are also working with the controversial TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) method. It includes trapping stray cats, giving them veterinary care, neutering them and then release them in the area in which they were trapped. After release the cats are provided with food twice a day by volunteers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the problems with stray cats in Gothenburg and what the city's organizations and authorities are handling the problem. When the Country Administrative Board receives reports of isolated cases of stray cats, they inform the police, which is the authority that if possible, captures the <b>cat.</b> The organizations <b>working</b> with stray <b>cats</b> in the Gothenburg area are Djurens vänner in Gothenburg, Djurens samarittjänst in Gråbo, Råmossen katthem in Alingsås, Gilos katthjälp, Göteborgs djurskyddsförening in Mölnlycke, Djurhemmet Tigerharen, Västerkatten, Änglakatten, Gothiakatten and Göteborgs katthjälp. These work as shelters, foster homes and with the TNR method. There seem to be a little agreement about the solution to the problem with stray cats between the authorities and organizations in Gothenburg. However, they all think that a mandatory identification marking of cats would increase their status and thus probably reduce the number of stray cats. Some of the organizations in Gothenburg also want mandatory neutering of outdoor domestic cats, in order to prevent an increase in unwanted cats. The Country Administrative Board, the police and some of the cat organizations in Gothenburg says that the TNR method is violating the Swedish legislation, and they will therefore not promote TNR. They are also hesitant to if it is ethical to allow domesticated cats living in the wild. According to them, increased use of TNR method may encourage people to release their cats adrift because they know there are people who feed them. The organizations involved in TNR believe that this method gives the feral cats which can not survive indoor a chance...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{looks at}} {{computer-aided}} translation (CAT), which, along with machine translation (MT), {{stands for the}} use of information technology in translation, but, unlike MT, is not of primary concern for Translation Studies research. Based on the current state of research, this thesis aims to address the syntax of CAT text output. The theoretical part first describes the <b>working</b> principles of <b>CAT</b> tools and presents them in the context of general translation studies, then defines information structure and endophoric reference as the syntactic phenomena to be analysed. Finally it provides a methodological model for the empirical part. Using a set of texts translated with CAT tools and a set of texts translated without them, the empirical part seeks to check whether translators using CAT tools tend to shift from the syntagmatic approach to text to a more paradigmatic one. To this end, an analysis is carried out to determine the interference rate in the information structure of the target texts as well as the rate of subjectively motivated shifts in distant endophoric reference. The final part of the thesis confronts the analysis results and the data reflecting the process of producing the collected texts in order to take into account other potential factors than the use of CAT tools.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my research}} is {{to determine how the}} parasite load in client-owned and feral cats relates to zoonotic diseases that are potentially carried by these cats. I will test the null hypothesis that parasite load is not correlated with the presence of organisms that cause zoonotic diseases. I will also test the null hypothesis that parasite load and the occurrence of zoonotic diseases does not differ between feral and privately-owned cats. My methods include obtaining voided fecal samples from the <b>cats</b> by <b>working</b> with the Murray-Calloway County Humane Society Feral Cat Spay-and-Neuter Program in trapping feral <b>cats</b> and <b>working</b> with <b>cat</b> owners in Calloway County to obtain the fecals from privately-owned cats. I will measure the parasite load in the feces through direct fecal smear, centrifuged fecal flotation, McMaster flotation technique, and acid fast fecal stain. The centrifuged fecal flotation will concentrate parasites present onto a slide and will easily be evaluated under a microscope. If parasites are present in the centrifuged fecal flotation, then the parasite load will be quantified using a modification of the McMaster flotation technique. The direct stain and the centrifuged fecal flotation will be done to determine the presence of motile trophozoite parasites such as Giardia. The acid-fast fecal will be done to detect Cryptosporidium. Other zoonotic microorganisms that will be detected through the combination of the four tests include Toxocara, Balisascaris, Ancylostoma, and Eucoleus aerophila. My research is significant because understanding feral cats and their health is important to local communities due to many of the zoonotic diseases that these cats can transmit to people. These diseases can be passed from feral and privately-owned animals as well as through inanimate objects left outside that may come in contact with the carrier. Testing my first hypothesis of parasite load being correlated with the presence of zoonotic diseases will provide information on the prevalence of zoonotic disease in cats in our local area. It also allows insight into prevention of the spread of these diseases through parasite prevention in feral cats and allows for new prevention ideas in conjunction with spay-and-neuter other than extermination. Testing the occurrence of zoonotic diseases between feral and privately-owned cats is also significant in terms of understanding the possible issues with reintroducing feral cats into domestic populations {{and the extent to which}} privately-owned cats pose a health risk to nearby humans and animals...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study was undertaken {{in order to}} explore the phenomenon of transcending burnout as described by mental health nurses working as part of Crisis Assessment and Treatment (CAT) Teams (operating in the community) including Enhanced CAT (ECAT) Teams. Community mental health nursing has repeatedly {{been reported to be}} a highly stressful and demanding working environment with community mental health nurses being considered to be at high risk of becoming burnt out. This has the potential to contribute to deterioration in the quality of care or service being provided, high rates of job turnover and workforce instability, absenteeism, and low individual and team morale. At a personal level burnout contributes to a variety of personal issues including physical and emotional exhaustion, insomnia, increased use of alcohol and drugs, and marital and family problems. Nurses <b>working</b> on <b>CAT</b> Teams are at high risk of burnout due to the high levels of acuity, risk and unpredictability in the consumers they provide care for. A descriptive phenomenological approach in the Husserlian tradition was chosen to guide the research process with Colaizzi’s (1978) method utilised to structure the data analysis process. Data was collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 participants. Nine emergent themes were explicated: (1) Personal Strength: Grim Determination, Pragmatism and Optimism, (2) Reaching for Support, (3) Weathering the Storm, (4) Making Sense of the Personal Non-Sense and Re-Finding Clinical Meaning, (5) Regaining Balance and Lost Control, (6) Transcending Through Connection with the World Outside, (7) Rebuilding the Boundaries and Affirming Realistic Expectations, (8) Transcending Burnout as the Road Goes Ever On and (9) Increasing Confidence in Credibility. Ultimately, transcending burnout involved the participants undergoing an intense though achievable journey. In the earliest phase of the experience, the experience of transcending involved hanging on using whatever came to hand, be it person qualities or reached out reflexively to those around them. As the experience evolved there was a gradual change in the participant’s state of motion, shifted slowly from just holding their position to being able to exert some push back against the adversity that they were facing. In the final phase of the experience individuals experience of transcending broadened out as relationships and activities in the wider world were re-claimed as a source of positive emotion leading to the repairing and rebuilding their intrapersonal and interpersonal boundaries. Most importantly, the participants in the study showed that transcending burnout was possible, with their experiences having the potential to inform future professional developments in both clinical and educational practice...|$|R
