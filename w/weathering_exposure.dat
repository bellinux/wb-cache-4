5000|$|The UV {{life of a}} part is {{dependent}} upon UV additive level and type as well as part thickness and design, pigment type, level and effectiveness of dispersion, processing conditions and the geographic location where the molded part is used (see Figure 3). It is important when comparing resin UV performanceto ensure that the testing {{has been done on}} a consistent basis. In Figure 1, accelerated weathering data is presented. Generally, 2,000 hours corresponds to 1 year in Florida and 1,400 hours to 1 year in Southern Canada. Often terms like “UV-8” are used. UV-8 means the material can withstand 8,000 hours in a Xenon Ci-65 weatherometer. UV-2 or UV-4 would mean 2,000 or 4,000 hours respectively. Hence, UV-8 corresponds to approximately 4 years of continuous outdoor exposure in Florida. It is important to understand which weatherometer, i.e. Carbon Arc or Xenon, was used, as well as the details of how the weatherometer was run. ASTM D-2565 is the recognized standard. Testing can be performed using actual outdoor <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure,</b> such as Florida and Arizona, to confirm this data. Note Figure 1 uses the industry standard criteria of when the sample has reached less than 50% of its original break elongation to determine the end of the test. In most cases useful life of the part extends beyond this point. All samples in Figure 1 are nonpigmented as supplied by Exxon Chemical. The UV performance test data can be found on our data sheets for each specific grade.Light Stability CharacteristicsUltraviolet (UV) Stabilization Plastics are attacked and deteriorate when exposed to direct sunlight. When plastic tanks absorb the sun’s ultraviolet light, the UV energy excites the polymers’chains, causing them to break. The effects are discoloration, embrittlement and eventual cracking. Elevated temperatures and oxygen tend to accelerate the deterioration. Tanks listed as suitable for outdoor service are protected from UV attack by: coloring or pigmenting and/or adding internal stabilizers which preferentially absorb or dissipate the UV energy. Shading tanks from the sun will also prevent deterioration. Tanks must be free to expand or contract, avoid excessive tension on the tank. For assistance in selecting the appropriate tank for a specific application, see the Tank Resin Selector Guides with reputable resin manufacturers.Resources being published by [...] siting additional references to AVENGENERAL ISOLINES OF GLOBAL RADIATION AND THERE EFFECTS ON POLYMERSYears = 70 x UV Rating (Your Location’s Isoline) (from Figure 3)Example: Natural Part, Molded Properly, Using UV-8 Additive Package For Use in Floridai.e.Florida= 140 Kcal/cm@2/yr.

40|$|Wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) are {{an emerging}} material {{which has been}} widely applied in outdoor application, but their long-term decomposition behaviors under subtropical weather have not been completely characterized. In this study, WPCs manufactured using recycled wood flour and polypropylene resin were tested for the changes in surface characteristics, physical properties, and mechanical strengths after different time of <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure</b> for one year. Color differential tests showed that significant increase in lightness occurred at the first 90 days of <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure,</b> while notable cracking and mass loss of the components occurred after 90 or 180 days. Carbonyl indexes increased continuously during the testing period for all the tested WPCs. Moisture contents increased most significantly at the initial 90 days of the weathering tests and reached steady states afterward. Increases of water absorption and thickness swelling, and decreases in mechanical properties, were not dramatic except for the samples with excessive-dosed wood contents (i. e. 60 % wood flour). The degradation rates of all the parameters were higher than the literature values, which is most likely due to higher sunlight intensity and heavier rainfall in the tested subtropical regions. Changes in morphology of the WPCs surfaces and fracture areas confirmed with the experiment results, and more "pulled-out" fibers were observed for the WPCs after 1 year <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of perspiration, <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure,</b> and {{repeated}} laundering on ultraviolet radiation protection of a naturally colored cotton lightweight fabric that is suitable for summer clothing.

The findings showed that laundering without weathering increased the protection, whereas weathering significantly reduced the protection. The high humidity in the semi-tropical climate facilitated the decline of protection, but perspiration played a role in slowing down the reduction. The lowest Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) value after 15 laundering cycles was found in the specimen after the exposure to a hot and humid semi-tropical climate without perspiration treatment...|$|E

These studies confirmed that the long term stability of the coatings highly depend on the nanotube parameters such as nature, surface area and diameter. It was found that the photocatalytic degradation of epoxy matrix with TiO 2 nanotubes was prominent in TNT 1 filled coating compared with their TNT 2 variant. The higher possibility of exposure of epoxy monomer encapsulated inside both HNT and TNT 2 facilitated the cure reaction with UV light to create new chains during weathering...|$|E

40|$|By using {{pultrusion}} technique, {{three types}} of pultruded composites at 70 V/V% fibre loading have been produced which are pultruded kenaf fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PKRC), pultruded glass fibre reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PGRC) and pultruded glass/kenaf fibre hybrid reinforced unsaturated polyester composites (PGKRC). The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the behavior of PGKRC as compared to PKRC and PGRC after being subjected to natural <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure</b> of 200 days and six weeks of hygrothermal aging in distilled water at 65 ºC. In natural <b>weathering</b> <b>exposure</b> study, PGRC specimens recorded the least absorbed moisture while PKRC specimens showed the highest. PGKRC specimens took place in between these two specimens but closer to the PGRC instead of PKRC. Similar pattern were observed in the hygrothermal aging study. Flexural and compression tests carried out on all the {{three types of}} specimen had shown a decrement in mechanical properties after a prolonged exposure. Moisture invasion is the major factor that weakened the fibre-matrix interfaces which led to mechanical properties reduction and it acts differently for different types of pultruded composites due to the nature of the constituent fibres and the arrangement of the pultruded hybrid composites. The effects of different layering pattern in PGKRC were also studied and concluded based on the resulted mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|Whilst common {{intuition and}} {{the rapid growth}} of weather {{derivative}} practices effectively support the notion that equity returns are sensitive to weather randomness, empirical support is fragile. This thesis is the first study that investigates <b>weather</b> <b>exposure</b> and <b>weather</b> risk-return trade-off consistent with the arbitrage pricing theory (APT). It explores weather risk and its premium in the U. S. market during January 1980 to December 2009, based on three of the most weather-influenced industries. The research starts with the construction of ten seasonally-adjusted weather measures as the proxies of unexpected temperature, gauged in Fahrenheit degree and percentage terms. The <b>weather</b> <b>exposures</b> of individual firms are estimated based on each of the ten measures and the market return. Although average <b>weather</b> <b>exposure</b> coefficients are small, the number of firms with significant estimates is more than attributable to chance and results are more profound in utilities. The weather coefficients are mainly stable over the sample period, indicating that the introduction of weather derivatives does not significantly impact a firm’s <b>weather</b> <b>exposure.</b> Further investigation into summer and winter time reveals that most of the significant weather betas are found in winter. However, only a minority of firms have statistically different weather betas between the two seasons. Results are robust with respect to the ten measures. The finding that unpredictable weather broadly affects groups of stocks has a direct implication in asset prices, as weather risk {{may be one of the}} priced factors. In this study, the weather risk premium is estimated using the standard two-pass Fama and MacBeth (1973) methodology, enhanced with Shanken’s adjustments for the errors in variables problem. The tests are based on firm-level and portfolio-level regressions, assessed by different model specifications and repeated for the ten weather measures. In the unconditional setting, there is little support that the market price of weather risk is not zero. Although the estimates are insignificant, the magnitudes of weather premiums are relatively high compared with those of other macroeconomic factors in previous literature. Most of the estimated weather pricings are negative; thus, stocks exposed to weather should be hedged against an unanticipated increase in temperature. The main pricing results are robust to alternative sample sets, portfolio formations, base assets and weather measures. Nonetheless, the significance of weather premium is slightly affected by model specifications. In few cases, the pricings of weather risk are significant when the positive values of weather betas are used in cross-sectional regressions.
