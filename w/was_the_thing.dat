A couple of short, hard burst from there and that was usually it.

[...] "His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued. That sort of action <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that suggested Spacewar. He had some very glowing descriptions of spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers." [...] Other influences cited by fellow programmer Martin Graetz include E.E. Smith's Skylark novels and Japanese pulp fiction tokusatsu movies.|$|E

500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time is what made the show work." ...|$|E
500|$|Les Jackson {{took over}} command of No.75 Squadron {{the day after}} his brother was killed. Although the {{squadron}} was no longer an effective fighting unit, it had checked Japan's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack, and the town continued to function as an important Allied base. John Jackson was survived by his wife and children, and interred in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at a value of £29,780 ($1,870,800 in 2011). [...] His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. [...] Jackson was a keen amateur film maker, and a four-minute reel of 16mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his honour; it later became Jacksons International Airport. In a 1989 interview, fellow No.75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented, [...] "I would say that had JohnF. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role {{for as long as it}} was... So the whole spirit of JohnF's leadership, and I suppose his final sacrifice, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that made 75 Squadron." [...] In March 2003, the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity, Aboriginal fighter pilot Len Waters.|$|E

500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E
500|$|It {{took about}} six weeks to write the Blood Beast script. It was written under the working title Creature from Galaxy 27, which was {{conceived}} by Varno, but the Corman brothers later changed it to Night of the Blood Beast. Gene Corman received film credit for conceiving the film's story, but Varno claimed he wrote the film almost entirely himself and that Corman {{had little to do}} with the story: [...] "He had some rambling ideas but they didn't have very much to do with the movie that became Night of the Blood Beast." [...] Varno also said of him: [...] "Gene didn't open his mouth, really, until Roger told him he could." [...] Varno said he wrote the screenplay alone and showed parts of it to Roger and Gene Corman as he went along. Varno researched medical and aerospace technology at a library in Hollywood near Vine Street. The story, which fictionally portrays America's manned voyage into space, was heavily influenced by the real life Space Race ongoing between the United States and Soviet Union at the time. Gene Corman said another major inspiration <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> from Another World (1951), a Howard Hawks-directed science fiction film about a group of soldiers and scientists threatened by an alien creature in a remote Arctic research outpost. He said of the film, [...] "How could you not be ? We had to be, if only indirectly or subconsciously. That was a classic film then, a classic film today." [...] However, Varno said any influence from The Thing was only subconscious: [...] "I loved some of the scenes in The Thing and I'm sure that crept in one way or another, but not overtly." ...|$|E

Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire.

2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
