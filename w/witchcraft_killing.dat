50|$|The {{discovery}} of the bizarrely mutilated body in the Thames {{who seems to have}} been the victim of a ritualistic <b>witchcraft</b> <b>killing</b> sparks a wave of violence amongst London’s Ugandan exile community. DI Moses Jones (Shaun Parkes) is seconded to the case from Scotland Yard due to his supposed cultural links with the local African community and assisted by young, hopeful DS Dan Twentyman (Matt Smith), he sets out to uncover the truth.|$|E

40|$|M. A. (Historical studies) The years 1980 s and 1990 s saw a {{different}} kind of violence in South Africa, especially in Venda. South Africa's long history of violence was always associated with the anti-apartheid struggle and a good example of this was the 1976 student uprising in Soweto. During the 1980 s and 1990 s many people accused of practicing witchcraft were killed and the perpetrators were showered with praises from all quarters of the community. It is believed that the majority of those who perished were women. This was possible because the idea that witches were women had gained fertile ground both at Fefe, Tshiungani and also in academic work. Many academic writers and popular memory showed little interest in women's role in <b>witchcraft</b> <b>killings.</b> Only men were viewed as comrades. These are the perceptions that this research will attempt to disprove. At the end statements such as witches were not always women, women were not always passive and finally, women were also comrades will be made, therefore disproving perceptions that people might have nurtured all along. This will be made clear by focusing on two case studies involving witchcraft violence...|$|R
5000|$|Persons {{with the}} genetic {{condition}} of albinism (commonly {{referred to as}} [...] "albino") are being targeted for their body parts in <b>witchcraft</b> related <b>killings.</b> It is a common belief in most African countries that the body parts of a person with albinism (PWA) are able to bring them prosperity or luck when made into a potion or talisman by a witchdoctor (traditional healer). This puts all PWA in grave danger {{with the result that}} most live in fear, especially {{in the months leading up}} to an election when attacks tend to increase.|$|R

50|$|The {{two reports}} that Fabian {{wrote on the}} case in 1945 and which are {{preserved}} on the police file make no mention of <b>witchcraft,</b> ritualistic <b>killing,</b> black dogs, natterjack toads or blood sacrifices. He may {{have been aware of}} some of the rumours and may even have had some personal experiences but, if so, cared too much about his reputation to include any references in official reports. However, twenty-five years later he felt able to write the following:I advise anybody who is tempted at any time to venture into Black Magic, witchcraft, Shamanism - call it what you will - to remember Charles Walton and to think of his death, which was clearly the ghastly climax of a pagan rite. There is no stronger argument for keeping as far away as possible from the villains with their swords, incense and mumbo-jumbo. It is prudence on which your future peace of mind and even your life could depend.|$|R
50|$|Alston's {{reports to}} the UN {{relating}} to extrajudicial executions also dealt with broad thematic issues that arose in many countries, such as <b>witchcraft</b> and vigilante <b>killings,</b> national-level commissions of inquiry dealing with unlawful killings, the problem of prisoners running prisons, the importance of witness protection programs, the problem of governmental reprisals against individuals or groups who have cooperated with a UN human rights inquiry, the need to regulate the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers, shoot-to-kill policies, the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law, mercy killings in times of armed conflict, {{and the need to}} make military justice systems human rights compatible. With respect to the death penalty, Alston's reports discussed the need for transparency, the unacceptability of the mandatory death penalty under international law, the definition of the 'most serious crimes' for which the death penalty may be imposed, the right to seek pardon or commutation of a death sentence, and the juvenile death penalty.|$|R
40|$|Between the 13 th and 19 th centuries, {{as many as}} {{one million}} {{individuals}} in Europe were executed for the crime of witchcraft. The majority of the trials and executions took place during the 16 th and 17 th centuries. During this period the speed and volume of executions were astonishing: in one German town as many as 400 people were killed in a single day (Midelfort, 1972). The trials were ubiquitous: conducted by both ecclesiastical and secular courts; by both Catholics and Protestants. The victims were primarily women, primarily poor and disproportionately widows. The persecutions took place throughout Europe, starting and ending earlier in southwest Europe than in the northern and eastern areas, and spread even across the Atlantic to Salem, Massachusetts. Although witchcraft trials in Europe and America largely ended by the late 18 th century, <b>witchcraft</b> accusations and <b>killings</b> still take place in many countries today, particularly in the developing world. For example, witchcraft is often blamed for AIDS deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa (Ashforth, 2001) and Miguel (2003) shows that negative economic shocks in Tanzania are associated with increases in witch-killing there. Belief in the witch, and fear of her, is enduring. While much work has been done on the motivations behind the European trials, th...|$|R
500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, {{and that she had}} told him to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by <b>witchcraft,</b> and of <b>killing</b> her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|R

Belief in the witch, and fear of her, is enduring. While much work has been done on the motivations behind the European trials, the large-scale causes remain unknown. The existing work has primarily been concerned with the factors that played into trials on a small scale—why a certain individual was targeted or why a certain type of individual was targeted in a given area. This work has indicated that there was a diverse set of issues that played into trials on an individual level. More broadly, however, there are few causal explana-tions for why witchcraft trials happened at all and on such a large scale in so man...|$|R
40|$|Is Africa rising? Many {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa experience remarkable growth. Afro-optimists claim that an economic transformation is imminent, while {{critics argue that}} growth is mainly in the extractive sectors, with little improvement being noted among the rural and urban poor. This collection of essays focuses on East Africa, {{with an emphasis on}} Tanzania. It is published as Professor Kjell Havnevik retires from the Nordic Africa Institute. He has carried out research, taught and supervised students, and participated in policy debates on agriculture, the environment and development policies in Africa. In this volume, authors review the challenges that agricultural producers have faced in the past and risk facing today and tomorrow; customary and individual land tenure regimes; the character of current growth; and policy dialogue between the donor community and the Tanzanian government. Several contributions converge on the drive for large-scale land acquisitions, their potential and shortcomings, {{as well as on the}} policy alternative – investment in small-scale farming. The book also includes essays on religion and education. In addressing all these development issues, these essays are a fitting tribute to the work of Kjell Havnevik, his colleagues and students.
