25|$|Consensus {{held that}} if Virginia, {{the most populous}} state at the time, did not ratify the Constitution, the new {{national}} government would not likely succeed. When the Virginia Ratifying Convention began on June 2, 1788, the Constitution {{had not yet been}} ratified by the required nine states. New York, the second largest state and a bastion of anti-federalism, would likely not ratify it without Virginia, and Virginia's exclusion from the new government would disqualify Virginian George Washington from being the first president. Virginia delegates believed that Washington's election as the first president was a condition for their acceptance of the new constitution and the new government. Arguably the most prominent anti-federalist, the powerful orator Patrick Henry was a delegate and had a following second only to Washington (who was not a delegate). Most delegates believed that Virginians mainly opposed the constitution. Initially Madison did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for election to the Virginia ratifying convention, but was persuaded to do so because the situation looked so bad. His role at the convention was likely critical to Virginia's ratification, and thus {{to the success of the}} constitution generally.|$|E

Whether you are 8 or 88 Juster's mixture of allegorical wisdom and logical whimsy will take you on a journey of the spirit. The Phantom is a mappa mundi of our hearts, proving once again that in laughter and simplicity lies the truth of life". In a 2011 article written for the book's fiftieth anniversary, Adam Gopnik wrote, [...] "The book is made magical by Juster's and Feiffer's gift for transforming abstract philosophical ideas into unforgettable images." ...|$|E

2500|$|Feinman {{spent seven}} {{months on the}} project and was paid $120,000 for her work. Feinman, however, was not {{mentioned}} anywhere in the book. [...] Clinton's acknowledgment section began: [...] "It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out." [...] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, [...] "I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> by every word." [...] Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of [...] "connecting paragraphs", while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.|$|E

Marie-Hélène, age 17, said [...] "I didn't really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for the one minute silence, I didn't think it was right to pay homage to a man who insulted Islam and other religions too". Abdul, age 14, said [...] "of course everyone stood for the one minute silence, and that includes all Muslims... I did it for those who were killed, but not for Charlie. I have no pity for him, he had no respect for us Muslims". It also {{reported that}} for most students at the Paul Eluard high school in Saint-Denis, freedom of expression is perceived as being [...] "incompatible with their faith". For Erica, who describes herself as Catholic, [...] "there are wrongs on both sides". A fake bomb was planted in the faculty lounge at the school.|$|E
2500|$|The MNLA's {{spokesman}} Hama Ag Mahmoud, {{speaking from}} Nouakchott, {{said of the}} destructions that [...] "the perpetrators of these heinous acts, their sponsors, and those who support them must be made accountable." [...] On the 12 July, the MNLA released a statement that read [...] "we call on the USA, France and all other countries who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> against Ansar Dine, Boko Haram and al Qaeda who are now holding Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal to help us kill them and help the people in those cities." [...] The MNLA and Tuareg refugees claimed, in interviews with the Western media, that Islamists had only previously bested the MNLA, despite their boasts of the MNLA having more fighters, because of superior firepower {{and the presence of}} foreign Islamist groups, like AQIM. An MNLA official in Nouakchott later clarified that they would only fight to remove the Islamists if [...] "we are not the ones to fight the terrorists all alone...it is important that the outside powers help us, to even up the balance of power." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Coppola was put {{on trial}} for murder, {{racketeering}} and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a [...] "rash" [...] decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. [...] "He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial for a murder he didn't commit," [...] Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola [...] "ran because he didn't want to face a jury like you. He hid because he didn't want to face a jury like you." [...] Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola {{said he did not}} agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not to ask him about the Lardiere murder.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{originally}} {{announced that}} he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on [...] "filmic storytelling". Because the story of the Passion is so well-known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: [...] "I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'" [...] The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a [...] professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Gibson chose to use Latin instead of Greek, which was the lingua franca of that particular part of the Roman Empire at the time, since there is no source for the Koine Greek spoken in that region. The street Greek spoken in the ancient Levant region of Jesus' day is not the exact Greek language used in the Bible. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{written for}} the pair included the opposition of Colleen's family to the pairing, J.T.'s music career, and third party characters who came between them. In 2003, J.T. cheated on Colleen with Anita Hodges, an older woman considered a [...] "sexy cougar". Luckinbill explained J.T. as being [...] "weak in a desperate moment", and that he [...] "felt really sorry for someone he's known his whole life, and the good side of J.T. emerged to offer Anita some comfort. Then it got really out of hand." [...] He added that J.T. [...] "cares deeply" [...] for Colleen and [...] "realizes she will be devastated by his actions". Luckinbill felt that J.T. [...] "wouldn't hurt her for the world, and yet {{that is exactly what}} he'll end up doing". In May 2004, Fonseca's contract was not renewed and she was confirmed to exit. Within the storyline, Colleen leaves Genoa City and J.T. because she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> {{in the way of his}} music career. However, she returned to reprise the role briefly that December. [...] J.T. had begun dating Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) and the writers wanted to bring Colleen back to [...] "add more complications to the story". Luckinbill described his character's feelings for Colleen and Brittany as extremely different, saying: [...] "J.T. saw Colleen as somebody so opposite himself that he considered himself undeserving of her love. She was too angelic [...] Brittany has more of the 'black sheep' in her." [...] Fans of the pair campaigned for a reunion between J.T. and Colleen when Fonseca returned, and pushed for her to be put back on contract. Fonseca and Luckinbill also anticipated the repairing of their characters because of a positive viewer response. Fonseca described it as being [...] "the best part of coming back", stating: [...] "Already it seems the fans [...] excited to see us together again." [...] Luckinbill stated: [...] "When they were together, they were like some sort of supercouple and there is a huge amount of fans who still want them together." [...] News of Fonseca's second exit incited a fan outcry and a campaign pushing for the actress's permanent return. Fonseca made her final appearance as Colleen in February 2005.|$|E
