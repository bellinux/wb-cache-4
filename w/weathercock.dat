5|$|South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, {{which was}} laid out by C.E.Mallows in about 1905. The garden {{contains}} the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a <b>weathercock.</b> It is listed at GradeII. In {{the centre of the}} garden is a statue of Mercury and in front of the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2ndDuke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and <b>weathercock.</b> There are nineteenth century louvred paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
25|$|The west {{tower was}} {{constructed}} in the 15th century with local red sandstone. The tower is perpendicular in style and has a recessed spire. The spire was blown down in 1594 and in 1601 money was spent rebuilding the tower and topping it with a <b>weathercock.</b>|$|E

25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a <b>weathercock</b> on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{church is}} built in shale with {{sandstone}} dressings, {{and a red}} tile roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel with six bays in a single chamber, a vestry on the north near the west corner and a porch opposite it. Near the west end is a bell turret with a spire. At the chancel end and over the porch are metal cross finials. Above the bell turret is a slated broach spire which is surmounted by a <b>weathercock.</b> There is a clock face {{on the south side}} of the spire. On the east wall are three small windows, rather than the usual larger east window. The main door and a priest's door on the south wall are Norman. The other windows date from the 19thcentury.

2500|$|The church four-stage {{tower is}} of Gothic Decorated style below, and Perpendicular above. The lower early 14th-century three stages are of coursed {{ironstone}} with limestone ashlar cornerstone dressings; the top late 14th-century stage is entirely ashlar, {{as are the}} battlements, pinnacled at each corner, and the crocketed recessed octagonal spire. The spire is topped by a finial with <b>weathercock,</b> and at its lower part contains a single run of twin-light pointed arch lucarnes, these on each alternate face, [...] each set in gables with a globed device attached above. The tower is drained by one gargoyle centrally placed on each side below the battlements. Each corner is buttressed to the full height of the tower {{on the west side}} and from the nave and aisles upwards on the east. Clasping buttresses run {{to the top of the}} third (belfry) stage, and angled buttresses run over the fourth. The tower first stage contains one large pointed arch Decorated window, this on the west side, with no hood mould and plain glazed with twin lights (lancets) [...] leading to trefoil heads. The central mullion runs to an oval rosette with quatrefoil insets, characteristic of c.1250-1310 Geometrical tracery. The second stage contains small and narrow single light windows on all but the east side. The third stage lies above the line of the nave, with the achievement of a single window on all sides. Each of these windows are of similar pattern to the bottom stage west window, but smaller, with transomseparating horizontal barand with an attached hood mould. The fourth stage windows are elongated versions of the third stage, but with added label stops at the spring of the hood mould. The tower sits on a simple moulded socle (plinth) topped by a cill bandangled projection that allows water to flow from a building facewhich continues around the whole church apart from the south aisle.|$|E
2500|$|Hitch carved the church's pulpit and {{completed}} the figural {{work for the}} reredos in the Parish church of Woodham in Surrey. The pulpit is {{on the north side}} of the Nave arch and is carved from oak. It was dedicated on Sunday 26 October 1913 by the Archdeacon of Surrey. The reredos was designed in early 14th Century Gothic style by the Reverend Ernest Geldart and was executed in 1915 in Corsham stone from Corsham quarries and was dedicated in 1915. At the time of dedication only the central panel was complete and the niches were unoccupied, but at rapid intervals the figures were completed and the reredos was dedicated by the vicar on Easter Eve 15 April 1922. [...] An aumbury and arcading on the north wall was added in 1918 and the work completed in 1921. Again Hitch did all the carving involved. The central panel of the reredos is surmounted by a canopy in carved stone and contains a representation of Our Lord as the everlasting Priest [...] "after the order of Melchizedek [...] " [...] surrounded by Cherubs and bearing the sacramental Cup and Bread of Life. He stands upon an altar, from whence, beneath His feet, there issue the Four Rivers of the Gospel. On either side, kneeling angels adore Him and offer incense, which the Prophet says should accompany the [...] "Pure Offering" [...] in every place. On the base of the pedestal are carved the words from the Te Deum- [...] "Tu Rex Gloria Christe" [...] (Thou art the king of Glory, O Christ). The statues inserted in the niches and the wall panels complete the theme of the reredos [...] "ALL THY SAINTS GIVE THANKS TO THEE" [...] for they represent saints of every age and all climes, including England. The evangelists are shown above the central niches, not in human form, but as the four living creatures revealed to St John in the Heavenly Vision:- the Angel of St Matthew, the Lion of St Mark, the Ox of St Luke, and the Eagle of St John. All bear scrolls inscribed with the first words of their gospels in Latin : - [...] "Liber generationis Jesu Christi"; [...] "Initium Evangelii Jesu Christi"; [...] "Fuit in diebus herodis"; [...] "In principio erat Verbum". [...] The names of the sixteen saints represented and from North to South are St Francis of Assisi, St Hilda-Abbess, St Helena- matron, St Edward the Confessor-King, St Swithun-Confessor, Venerable Bede-Confessor, St Paul-Apostle, St Peter- Apostle, St Stephen-Martyr, St George-Martyr, St Jerome-Doctor, St Augustine of Hippo-Doctor, St Columba-Missionary, St Faith- Virgin, St Etheldreda-Queen and Abbess and St Hugh of Lincoln-Abbot. Special interest attaches to the figure of St Swithun as he carries a small model of Winchester Cathedral. [...] St Swithun, the friend and educator of Alfred the Great was Bishop of Winchester A. D. 860, and in the “Bededictional of St Ethelworld” (a magnificently illuminated manuscript, formally one of the Treasures of the Chapter and now in the British Library), there is a drawing of the cathedral showing the columns and capitals, the roof with its red tiles and above it the golden <b>weathercock.</b> By kind permission of the dean a tracing was made of the copy given to the Chapter by the Duke of Westminster, the then owner and from this a drawing was made which Hitch followed for his sculpture. Hitch also carried out the carving on the front altar in the Lady Chapel. The central panel represents the moment of the presentation of the Holy Child in the Temple. Simeon is holding the child, while Mary is kneeling in an attitude of deep devotion and St Joseph is standing a little behind with his head inclined in prayer. On each side are panels with carved lilies with their leaves open. A photograph is shown here of Hitch’s carving of “Our Lord as the Everlasting Priest”, part of the reredos.|$|E
