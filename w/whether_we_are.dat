25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care for one moment how that is; it is no matter <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E
25|$|She {{quickly became}} a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the {{proposed}} Spadina Expressway. A frequent theme of her work was to ask <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> building cities for people or for cars. She was arrested twice during demonstrations. She also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the St. Lawrence neighborhood, a housing project regarded as a major success. She became a Canadian citizen in 1974, and she later told writer James Howard Kunstler that dual citizenship was not possible at the time, implying that her U.S. citizenship was lost.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. <b>Whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> concerned with a Creator or the substratum which underlies {{our experience of}} phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{dismissed}} the Amendment, declaring [...] "we must decide <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{to stand on}} the silly shibboleth of national security," [...] a statement supporters of the Amendment eagerly seized upon. The Committee was joined in opposing the Amendment by the League of Women Voters, the American Association for the United Nations, and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, one of the few bar associations to oppose the Amendment.|$|E
500|$|In 1975 {{psychologist}} Lawrence Casler {{called for}} empirical {{research into the}} relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish {{if there is an}} effect at work or <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> being [...] "seduced by Lady Luck". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, U.S. presidential {{candidate}} George W. Romney said the following regarding the White Horse Prophecy: [...] "I {{have always felt}} that they meant that sometime the question of <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to proceed {{on the basis of}} the Constitution would arise and at this point government leaders who were Mormons would be involved in answering that question." [...] In 2007, U.S. {{presidential candidate}} Mitt Romney, George's son, told the Salt Lake Tribune that [...] "I haven't heard my name associated with [...] or anything of that nature. [...] That's not official church doctrine.... I don't put that at the heart of my religious belief." ...|$|E
500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what {{we think we are}} (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E
500|$|Sociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz {{consider}} Alvy and Annie's {{relationship to}} be a stereotype {{of gender differences}} in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as [...] "the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on." [...] Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise {{of his relationship with}} Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that [...] "It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades," [...] a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately [...] "irrational and crazy and absurd", but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight points out that Annie Hall is framed through Alvy's experiences. [...] "Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor." [...] He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with [...] "past and future protagonists {{as well as with the}} director himself", it [...] "makes a difference as to <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events". Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note. Despite the narrative's framing, [...] "the joke is on Alvy." ...|$|E

500|$|Former {{president}} of the Czech Republic and writer Václav Havel characterized the phrase among [...] "commonly canonized demagogical tricks." [...] The Economist popularized the term whataboutism in a 2008 article, for the repeated usage of this rhetorical tactic by the Soviet Union. The magazine wrote that the tactic became overused, {{and by the time}} of the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had become a figure of speech referring to the entirety of Soviet propaganda. The book Exit from Communism edited by Stephen Richards Graubard made a similar point, that the term encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: [...] "Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do or perhaps they do not lynch blacks... Ultimately it does not matter <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story." [...] With the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, The New York Times reported that the tactic could see decreased usage: [...] "In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violation with 'But you hang Negroes,' analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain." [...] Journalist George Feifer recounted in a 2009 article how when he traveled to Moscow in 1959 to cover the American National Exhibition, he faced those using the phrase against him. Feifer wrote: [...] "Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?" [...] In 2011, author Michael Dobson wrote that the phrase was a form of the pot calling the kettle black, and a [...] "famous example" [...] of the tu quoque reasoning derived from a [...] "famous 1960s era Russian joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{also said}} that Obama had [...] "movingly mourned and honored the victims", and [...] "encouraged every American who participates in our {{political}} debates - <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on {{the left or right}} or in the media - to aspire to a more generous appreciation of one another and a more modest one of ourselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of course, {{one might}} wonder <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{justified}} in assuming that [...] The answer is affirmative, if the flow satisfies certain basic assumptions. In particular, if [...] and , then the assumed relation follows {{directly from the}} linear theory of sound waves (see, e.g., the linearized Euler equations and the acoustic wave equation). In fact, the approximate relation between [...] and [...] that we assumed is just a linear approximation to the generic barotropic equation of state of the fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Epistemologically, {{it is not}} {{impossible}} to tell <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> living in a simulation.

[...] However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.|$|E
