5|$|Aberdeen's {{first and}} only foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was {{appointed}} in 1999 and his time in charge coincided {{with some of the}} heaviest defeats in the club's history. The low point of the club's history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of the table. As the Scottish Premier League was being expanded to twelve teams, there <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> three team play-off. However, as Falkirk's stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight. This was followed by an early-season defeat to Ireland's Bohemian F.C. on the away goals rule in the next season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department of correspondence during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

Her mother, Judith Ann (née Hawkins), who is of English and German ancestry, was a psychiatric nurse.

Berry's maternal grandmother, Nellie Dicken, was born in Sawley, Derbyshire, England, while her maternal grandfather, Earl Ellsworth Hawkins, was born in Ohio. Berry's parents divorced when she was four years old; she and her older sister, Heidi Berry-Henderson, were raised exclusively by their mother.|$|E

Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
