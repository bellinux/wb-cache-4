5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about the pitfalls and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the <b>wetness</b> of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with <b>wetness</b> on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Littorio {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ansaldo shipyards in Genoa on 28 October 1934 to commemorate the Fascist Party's March on Rome in 1922. Her sister Vittorio Veneto was laid down the same day. Changes to the design {{and a lack of}} armor plating led to delays in the {{building}} schedule, causing a three-month slip in the launch date from the original plan of May 1937. Littorio was launched on 22 August 1937, during a ceremony attended by many Italian dignitaries. She was sponsored by Signora Teresa Ballerino Cabella, the wife on an Ansaldo employee. After her launch, the fitting out period lasted until early 1940. During this time, Littorios bow was modified to lessen vibration and reduce <b>wetness</b> over the bow. Littorio ran a series of sea trials over a period of two months between 23 October 1939 and 21 December 1939. She was commissioned on 6 May 1940, and after running additional trials that month, she transferred to Taranto where shealong with Vittorio Venetojoined the 9th Division under the command of Rear Admiral Carlo Bergamini.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and <b>wetness</b> of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{disposable}} baby {{diapers and}} incontinence products have a layered construction, {{which allows the}} transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents <b>wetness</b> and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for <b>wetness,</b> and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers <b>wetness</b> to the absorbent layer.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} Camera Obscura, other factors {{are present in}} play. The {{characters}} can glimpse pieces of a ghost's past upon defeating them or when they launch a special attack. Characters can also concentrate on items in the environment related to missing people, generating a shade that leads them to the person's location. A <b>wetness</b> meter tracks how damp the character gets when navigating environments. The amount of <b>wetness</b> has positive and negative effects on the character: being wet increases {{the damage done by}} the Camera Obscura while increasing the number of ghosts present in an area and attacks causing more damage. In addition, characters can be inflicted with a status ailment from dark-colored ghosts or from a special attack: this ailment decreases vision and defense, and deteriorating health. The ailment is only lifted by defeating all the enemies in the area or using an item to remove all <b>wetness.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other common {{features}} of disposable diapers include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include <b>wetness</b> indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.|$|E
25|$|It {{was under}} these auspices that the grapevine {{followed}} land prospector John Howe as he cut {{a path through}} the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and <b>wetness,</b> and plantings to the west were limited by spring frost damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, almost by default, the wine region of the new colony.|$|E
25|$|Watering: Different {{species of}} tree have roots with {{different}} tolerances for soil moisture. Some species tolerate continual <b>wetness,</b> {{while others are}} prone to rotting if the soil remains wet for long periods. A standard bonsai practice is to grow trees in a soil mixture that drains rapidly, so that roots {{are not allowed to}} be wet for long. To compensate for the relatively low water retention of the bonsai soil, water is applied frequently. The tree absorbs sufficient moisture for its needs while the water is passing through the soil, then the soil dries enough to reduce the chance of rotting. It is the grower's responsibility to ensure that watering occurs frequently enough to satisfy the bonsai with high watering requirements, while not waterlogging trees that use little water or have roots prone to rotting.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the <b>wetness</b> and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E

500|$|Props {{utilised}} {{to heighten}} the horror included a trick candle—swapped back-and-forth {{with a real}} one—which could shoot a large flame. This was operated by a technician hiding under the table on which it was placed. A doll seen on screen, the writers claimed, was probably visible only to Terry among the characters. For the white eyes of [...] "Madam Talbot", Steadman wore partially white contact lenses. Had she worn fully white lenses, {{she would have been}} unable to see, and this would have led to more work for the production crew. Instead, her partially white eyes were made fully white in post-production. Also added in post-production was the <b>wetness</b> of Terry's clothes in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|Westerly {{flow from}} the mild north Atlantic leads to <b>wetness</b> across western Europe, in {{particular}} Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the western coasts can receive between , at sea-level and , on the mountains of rain per year.

During the fall, winter, and spring, Pacific storm systems bring most of Hawaii and the western United States much of their precipitation. Over the top of the ridge, the jet stream brings a summer precipitation maximum to the Great Lakes. Large thunderstorm areas known as mesoscale convective complexes move through the Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes during the warm season, contributing up to 10% of the annual precipitation to the region.|$|E
500|$|Gneisenau {{was laid}} down on 3May 1935 at the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. She was {{launched}} on 8December 1936, and completed on 21May 1938. During her launch, the ship sustained minor damage to her stern; the chains slowing her {{slide down the}} slipway broke, and the ship drifted too far and became beached on the opposite shore. After her commissioning, Gneisenau spent {{the first year of}} her career conducting trials and training cruises in the Baltic Sea. The cruises revealed the <b>wetness</b> of the bow and bridge; in January 1939 her [...] "Atlantic bow" [...] was installed. Scharnhorst was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven, on 16May 1935. She was launched on 30June 1936 and completed on 7January 1939. In mid 1939, the ship conducted trials in the Baltic Sea; as with Gneisenau, the ship's low freeboard necessitated the installation of the [...] "Atlantic bow", which was completed in August 1939. During that refit, a large hangar for the ship's aircraft was added amidships. The ship emerged from the dockyard in October.|$|E
500|$|Her {{design was}} a {{development}} {{of that for}} Palmers' [...] torpedo boat destroyers, which had been completed between 1897 and 1899, although most changes were minor. For example, whereas the Star-class ships had three funnels, of which the middle one was more substantial, Spiteful had four, of which the central two were narrower and grouped together. Spitefuls length overall was , her beam was [...] and her draught was [...] Her light displacement was 400tons (406.4tonnes). In common with similar Royal Navy ships of the time, her forecastle was of the [...] "turtle-back" [...] type with a rounded top: this design was intended to keep the forecastle clear of sea water, but in practice had the adverse effect of digging a ship's bow into the sea when it was rough, thereby making ships lose speed, besides making them [...] "wet and uncomfortable". <b>Wetness</b> was mitigated by screening across {{the rear of the}} forecastle and around the forward gun position, below which was the enclosed conning tower. A foremast stood behind the conning position and was fitted with a derrick. The crew numbered 63officers and men, for whom the accommodation on this type of ship was [...] "very cramped; usually the captain had a small cabin but... other officers lived in the wardroom." [...] The remainder of the crew slept in hammocks. As ordered Spiteful probably carried four boats, comprising a gig, a dinghy and two lifeboats of the Berthon type.|$|E

2500|$|Methane {{is a major}} {{component}} of natural gas. Geosphere methane is intriguing for the large input of microbial methanogenesis. This process exhibits a strong isotope effect, resulting in greater D-depletion in methane relative to other hydrocarbons. δD ranges from -275‰ to -100‰ in thermogenic methane, and from -400‰ to -150‰ in microbial methane. Also, methane formed by marine methanogens is generally enriched in D relative to methane from freshwater methanogens. δD of methane has been plotted together with other geochemical tools(like δ13C, gas <b>wetness)</b> to categorize and identify natural gas. A δD-δ13C diagram (sometimes referred to as CD diagram, Whiticar diagram, or Schoell diagram [...] ) is widely used to place methane in one of the three distinct groups: thermogenic methane that is higher in both δ13C and δD; marine microbial methane that is more depleted in 13C and freshwater microbial methane that is more depleted in D. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis produces less D-depleted methane relative to acetoclastic methanogenesis. The location where the organism lives and substrate concentration also affect isotopic composition: rumen methanogenesis, which occurs in a more closed system and with higher partial pressures of hydrogen, exhibits a greater fractionation (-300 to -400‰) than wetland methanogenesis (-250 to -170‰).|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality.

[...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes.
