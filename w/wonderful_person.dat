The Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia [...] wrote that Capaldi's video {{was an example}} of bringing joy into someone's life through a small act. The Washington Post called it a touching message. The Daily Dot described the video as inspirational. The Independent contrasted Capaldi's portrayal of the 12th Doctor as one of the darker incarnations of the character with his kinder message as the same character in the video. MTV called Capaldi a most <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> for his act, and concluded that the video was quite endearing.|$|E

His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang everybody and knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a <b>wonderful</b> <b>person.</b> Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} that the writers' and directors' guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the {{character}} was named Natasha [...] "Tasha" [...] Yar. Her surname was suggested by Robert Lewin, drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the Second World War. Her biography stated that she was 28years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher, and was described in the guide as [...] "treat this boy like the most <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had." [...] In April 1987, Lianne Langland, Julia Nickson, Rosalind Chao, Leah Ayres and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role. Chao was a favorite candidate, while Denise Crosby was described as [...] "the only possibility" [...] for the character of Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two parts together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the [...] "exotic" [...] Troi.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to all parents who, no doubt, have their weaknesses, but are <b>wonderful</b> <b>persons</b> nevertheless. Parenting adolescents is identified as probably the most difficult parenting task. Teens are preoccupied with identity crisis, eager to be independent; hasty to be adulst- essentially lost, disturbed, and frightened with consequent loss of self esteem that usually results in deep depression and a “Rebel without a cause ” behavior pattern. Accelerated by rapid advances in media technology, adolescence now starts as early as 8 years of age, and has become more difficult today. Hence love, understanding and care by parents are more crucial now than before. Parents need {{to accept the fact}} that the peer group, central to adolescence culture, is a place for experimentation; and a supportive setting for achieving the two primary adolescence developmental tasks of identity and autonomy.

According to all accounts, the clouds of glory I brought into the world--a habit of smiling at everything I looked at and at every person that approached me--ceased to be visibly trailed at about that age; I only remember myself as a common little boy--just a little wild animal running about on its hind legs, amazingly interested in the world in which it found itself.|$|R

Not only is the demands on farmers as the world‟s population grow increase, but the circumstances surrounding the demands are also becoming less predictable.

[...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People think that was a raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a <b>wonderful</b> <b>person</b> and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix.

40|$|Language-oriented design {{embraces the}} use of language-based abstrac-tions to improve understandability, extensibility, and {{maintainability}} of code. Most existing applications are not designed and implemented in a language-oriented way. The use of domain-specific language extensions could improve them in many regards but rewriting them from scratch is far too tedious. With SugarJ you can incrementally and independently in-troduce language-oriented design techniques to those parts of your legacy code that benefit the most from them. The result is a modernised code base that {{is less likely to}} contain bugs, and easier to extend and maintain.
