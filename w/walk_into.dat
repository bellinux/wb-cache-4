5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E

5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds.

Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene.

Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E
