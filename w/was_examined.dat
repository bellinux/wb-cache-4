Sawtrey recanted his heresies in public and {{apparently}} received no serious punishment, but after moving to London, Sawtrey's heretical preaching {{attracted the attention of}} Archbishop Thomas Arundel and he was summoned to appear before a convocation at St. Paul's. Despenser did not attend but sent a written memorandum on 23 February. Following his trial Sawtrey was condemned as a relapsed heretic and was burned in chains at Smithfield in 1401.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.|$|E

Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view.

5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E

5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured £100,000. The historian David Starkey was highly critical of the sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E
