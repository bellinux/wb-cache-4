We used two hydroponic setups in which weekly N availability, i. e. amount of N per tree, differed being either low (N 1) or high (N 2). Net N availability was defined weekly as the relative amount of N remaining in each setup before solution replenishment.

We have adopted a genetic approach, which permits retrospective clonal analysis of myocardial cells in the mouse embryo, based on the targeting of an nlaacZ reporter to the alpha-cardiac actin gene. A rare intragenic recombination event leads to a clone of beta-galactosidase-positive myocardial cells. Analysis of clones at different developmental stages demonstrates that myocardial cells and their precursors follow a proliferative mode of growth, rather than a stem cell mode, with an initial dispersive phase, followed by coherent cell growth. Clusters of cells are dispersed along the venous-arterial axis of the heart tube. Coherent growth is oriented locally, with a main axis, which corresponds to the elongation of the cluster, and rows of cells, which form <b>secondary</b> <b>axes.</b> The angle between the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> varies, indicating independent events of growth orientation. At later stages, as the ventricular wall thickens, wedge shaped clusters traverse the wall and contain rows of cells at a progressive angle to each other.

40|$|AbstractDiffusible {{morphogen}} {{models have}} been used widely to explain regional specification of tissues and body axes during animal development. The three-signal model for patterning the dorsal–ventral axis of the amphibian embryo proposes, in part, that a factor(s) secreted from Spemann's organizer is responsible for converting lateral marginal zone into more dorsal cell fates. We examine the possibility that chordin, a secreted inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and candidate “dorsalizing signal,” is a long-range-acting factor. We show that chordin can, when overexpressed, act directly over distances of at least 450 μm in the early Xenopus embryo to create a gradient of BMP signaling. However, since lower levels of chordin can still induce <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> and these amounts of chordin act only locally to inhibit a BMP target gene, we suggest that chordin likely acts as a short-range signal in vivo. Furthermore, BMP 1, a secreted metalloprotease that cleaves chordin protein in vitro, inhibits chordin's axis-inducing effects, suggesting that BMP 1 functions to negatively regulate chordin's action in vivo. A dominant-negative mutant BMP 1 blocks the in vitro cleavage of chordin protein by wild-type BMP 1 and induces <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> when injected ventrally. We argue that BMP 1 and Xolloid are probably functionally redundant metalloproteases and may have two roles in the early Xenopus embryo. One role may be to inhibit the action of low-level chordin protein expressed throughout the entire embryo and a possible second role may be to inhibit activation of a juxtacrine cell relay, thereby confining chordin's action to the organizer region preventing chordin from functioning as a long-range-acting factor...|$|R

40|$|Disaggregating {{seagrass}} {{meadows and}} studying its components separately (clones, ramets, shoots) can provide us insights on meadow dynamics and growth patterns. The clonal growth, dependent upon clonal rules may regulate and impose constraints to plant architecture and, therefore, determine how individual clones evolve into the environment. In order {{to investigate the}} relationship between clonal growth rules and clone architecture, the belowground network architecture of single-clones of the seagrass Zostera noltii was studied. Networks were traced in situ after washing out the overlying sediment, and network characteristics were measured using digital analysis: area covered by clone, total rhizome length, type of rhizomatic <b>axes</b> (main, <b>secondary,</b> tertiary, quaternary), number and length of the internodes, branching angles and branching frequencies. This approach revealed that Z. noltii {{is able to develop}} into large clones integrating up to 300 internodes, 676 cm of rhizome, 208 shoots and 4, 300 cm 2 of plant area. Internodal length depended on both, the distance to the apical shoot (time effect) and the axes type (apical dominance effect). However, average branching angle was independent of axis type (average 58. 3 ± 0. 75), but varied significantly depending on the distance from the apical shoot. This average branching angle allows Z. noltii maximize the rate of centrifugal expansion, maintaining a high density in colonized areas to produce close stands but also minimizing the investment in belowground biomass and ramets overlapping. The clonal architecture of Z. noltii seems to be regulated by the interaction of both, apical dominance strength and clonal integration distance. Moreover, clonal growth rules and growth pattern seem to constrain clonality through (clonal) plant architecture regulations (i. e. branching is restricted in <b>secondary</b> <b>axes,</b> similar average branching angles regardless the axes, the higher the distance to the apex the higher the number of internodes in <b>secondary</b> <b>axes,</b> shorter internodes in <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>axes).</b> Future research efforts should focus on how these complex relationships between apical dominance and clonal integration interact to elucidate the temporal (seasonal) and spatial scales of both processes and the outcome at the plant architectural level. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} member of the HES family hairy 2 induces the ectopic expression of dorsal markers when it is overexpressed in the ventral side of Xenopus embryos. Intriguingly, hairy 2 represses the mesoderm transcription factor brachyury (bra) throughout its domain in the marginal zone. Here we show that in early gastrula, bra and hairy 2 are expressed in complementary domains. Overexpression of bra repressed hairy 2. Interference of bra function with a dominant-negative construct expanded the hairy 2 domain and, like hairy 2 overexpression, promoted ectopic expression of dorsal axial markers in the ventral side and induced <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> without head and notochord. Hairy 2 depletion rescued the ectopic dorsal development induced by interference of bra function. We concluded that an intact bra function is necessary to exclude hairy 2 expression from the non-organiser field, to impede the ectopic specification of dorsal axial fates {{and the appearance of}} incomplete <b>secondary</b> <b>axes.</b> This evidence supports a previously unrecognised role for bra in maintaining the dorsal fates inhibited in the ventral marginal zone, preventing the appearance of trunk duplications.

In addition, Smurf 1 associates with transforming growth factor-β type I receptor through the inhibitory Smad (I-Smad) Smad 7 and induces their degradation. Herein, we examined whether Smurf 1 negatively regulates BMP signaling {{together with the}} I-Smads Smad 6 / 7. Smurf 1 and Smad 6 cooperatively induced <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> in Xenopus embryos. Using a BMP-responsive promoter-reporter construct in mammalian cells, we found that Smurf 1 cooperated with I-Smad in inhibiting BMP signaling and that the inhibitory activity of Smurf 1 was not necessarily correlated with its ability to bind to Smad 1 / 5 directly. Smurf 1 bound to BMP type I receptors via I-Smads and induced ubiquitination and degradation of these receptors. Moreover, Smurf 1 associated with Smad 1 / 5 indirectly through I-Smads and induced their ubiquitination and degradation. Smurf 1 thus controls BMP signaling with and without I-Smads through multiple mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Carnivorous sponges (Porifera: Cladorhizidae) are a {{particularly}} interesting {{group of species}} typically occurring in deep-sea habitats. In this study a new species, Chondrocladia (Chondrocladia) robertballardi sp. nov., is described from specimens collected on two large north-east Atlantic seamounts – the Gorringe and Galicia Banks – located off the Iberian Peninsula. The holotype, collected on the Gorringe Bank by ROV, is a large, dichotomously branched and stalked sponge with translucent spheres {{in the middle of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>axes</b> and a rhizoid basal fixation system. Direct observations on the habit of the new species were made from the ROV. The paratypes, collected on the Galicia Bank by dredge and trawling, are fragments of different sizes. The skeleton is composed of a single class of styles and isochelae. All specimens were collected at similar depths (1400 – 1738 m) within the upper bathyal, and at the same longitude but separated by 670 km. A synthesis of the geographic as well as bathymetric distribution of this genus is presented. The species is compared with all known species of this genus worldwide. Versión del editor 1, 023...|$|R
40|$|The BMP 4 {{signaling}} pathway plays key roles during early embryonic development and for maintenance of adult homeostasis. In the extracellular space, BMP 4 activity is regulated {{by a group}} of interacting molecules including the BMP antagonist Chordin, the metalloproteinase Tolloid and Twisted gastrulation (Tsg). In this study, we identified Biglycan (Bgn), a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, as a new extracellular modulator of BMP 4 signaling. Xenopus Bgn (xBgn) is expressed uniformly in the ectoderm and mesoderm and their derivatives during development. Microinjection of Bgn mRNA induced <b>secondary</b> <b>axes,</b> dorsalized the mesoderm and inhibited BMP 4 activity in Xenopus embryos. Biochemical experiments showed that Bgn binds BMP 4 and Chordin, interaction that increased binding of BMP 4 to Chordin. Bgn was also able to improve the efficiency of Chordin–Tsg complexes to block BMP 4 activity. Using antisense morpholinos, we demonstrated that Bgn required Chordin to induce double axes in Xenopus. This work unveiled a new function for Bgn, its ability to regulate BMP 4 signaling through modulation of Chordin anti-BMP 4 activity...|$|R
