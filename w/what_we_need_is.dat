2500|$|John Brown (May 9, 1800 – December 2, 1859) was an American {{abolitionist}} {{who believed}} and advocated that armed insurrection {{was the only}} way to overthrow the institution of slavery in the United States. Brown first gained attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of 1856. Dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement, he said, [...] "These men are all talk. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> action—action!" [...] During the Kansas campaign, Brown commanded forces at the Battle of Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie. He and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the Pottawatomie massacre of May 1856 in response to the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, John Wendell was disappointed by Curtis, finding much of Mayfield's music more rhythmic than melodic, [...] "fragmentary, garbled and frustrating to listen to"; {{he called the}} lyrics haphazardly written and mealy-mouthed. [...] "He tries {{to deal with some}} pretty serious and complex subjects by stringing together phrases that end with the same sound—whether they make sense together or not", Wendell critiqued. [...] "Sure, it's all subjective, but I can't myself see that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> 'Respect for the steeple/power to the people.'" [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was also somewhat unmoved by the album's [...] "essentially middle-class guides to black pride" [...] but qualified his judgment as reflecting a certain degree of cultural relativism on his part, making note of African-American audiences having embraced the record.|$|E

[...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would go out and get it done".|$|E

[...] Clinton passionately retorted: [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change.

[...] Also on 29 May, Australian Prime Minister John Howard rejected criticisms that Australian troops had not secured Dili quickly enough, saying that the crisis was possibly more dangerous than the violence following independence from Indonesia in 1999, and that [...] "We cannot have a situation around the world and particularly in our region where Australia is told to respect the independence of a country and that it's a bully boy if it seeks to express a view or to intervene, but when something goes wrong Australia is then criticised for not having, quote, intervened earlier." ...|$|E

Gargan {{writing in}} November 1991 {{described}} Sharif's government as [...] "bedeviled by gossip, barraged by accusations of venality, castigated {{by the opposition}} and threatened by a final rupture of cordiality with the United States". The same year Najam Sethi described Sharif's government as [...] "it is corrupt, absolutely, astronomically corrupt, including the Prime Minister". In 2009, The New York Times commenting on Sharif's relationship with the U.S wrote that [...] "Bhutto and her Pakistan Peoples Party were considered more amenable allies for Washington" [...] adding that [...] "more nationalistic and religiously oriented, he (Sharif) and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, have traditionally found common cause with the religious parties". Pervez Hoodbhoy described [...] "Sharif {{as a reflection of}} (the) Pakistani society" [...] adding that [...] "he is silent on what matters most: the insurgency. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> a leader." [...] Celia W. Dugger, writing in 1999, described Sharif's Raiwind Palace as [...] "walls paneled in silken fabrics and rococo chairs laden with so much gold leaf they looked like they belonged in the court of Louis XIV or a bordello", drawing comparison between Sharif's lifestyle and that of the [...] "Mughals".|$|E
2500|$|After Obama's upset win in Iowa, it {{appeared}} to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primaries and then onward to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published on the Clinton campaign, as Obama surged to a roughly 10-point lead in the New Hampshire polls. However, the race turned quickly {{in the days before}} the primary, and the polls were slow to register a reversal toward Clinton. At the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire debate on [...] January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama against Clinton. In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring about change, while he and Obama could: [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack."

[...] It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy. The morning before the primary, Clinton became [...] "visibly emotional" [...] in response to a friendly question from a voter. Video of the moment was replayed on cable news television throughout the day, accompanied by pundit commentary that ranged from sympathetic to callous in tone. Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising three-percent victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count.
