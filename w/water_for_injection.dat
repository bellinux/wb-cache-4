Better prediction of AIM can be achieved by a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of its etiopatogenesis. In this study, we focused on the assessment of oxidative stress in 2 -h model of isoprenaline cardiotoxicity, i. e. the acute state, which shares several pathophysiological similarities with early phase of AMI, in Wistar:Han rats. The marker of oxidative stress was glutathione. Moreover, the analysis of correlations of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total glutathione (GSHt) and the ratio GSH/GSSG with ECG parametres was performed. The rats were divided into two groups, i. e. the control group (<b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>injections,</b> 2 ml/kg, s. c.) and the isoprenaline group (isoprenaline, 100 mg/kg, s. c.).

Male Wistar rats received either <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>injections</b> or EGCG <b>for</b> 3 consecutive days and then were subjected either to laparotomy or hepatectomy.

The activity of caspases 3 / 7, expression of p-p 53 and tissue levels of IL- 6 displayed a similar trend. EGCG in a dose of 20 mg/kg had no such effects. Next, male Wistar rats were subjected either to PHx or laparotomy. Twenty-four hours after the surgery, hepatocytes were isolated and treated with various concentrations of EGCG for 24 h.
