40|$|A {{small-scale}} propane burner {{test was}} developed to enable rapid characterization of composite systems under reproducible conditions for either hot face temperature or heat flux. The burner rig is a low cost device which enables a 100 mm square specimen {{to be subjected to}} a near uniform heat flux over its surface. The small-scale tests were conducted to measure the thermal conductivities of <b>woven</b> <b>roven</b> (WR) glass fiber mats with a weight of 0. 13 kg and 11. 8 mm thickness at high temperatures up to 800 °C. An empirical equation was derived for calculating the variation in thermal conductivity of the dry glass fiber mats. A series of fire resistance tests on composite laminates was carried out using a small scale furnace. During the tests the samples were that prepared and laminated using hand-lay-up techniques were exposed to fire conditions defined by a furnace temperature versus time curve. Excellent fire resistance under hydrocarbon curve test conditions was demonstrated for several matrix materials (i. e. isophthalic polyester, orthophthalic polyester, vinyl ester). This information was important for the marine sector and companies such as Devonport group (DML) and Vosper Thorneycroft (VT) to determine if materials could perform to the A 60 requirements. The A 60 requirements for fire resisting structural are refer to the subject the material to 60 minutes fire testing under the SOLAS temperature/time regime. This then press the material for CFRP pipe repair and metal vessels in petroleum and transportation industries. The experimental results from tests using the small scale furnace were compared with predictions of thermal responses of composite panels in fires using an existing theoretical model. The ID FD model is capable of modelling the thermal response behaviour of polyester/WR and vinyl ester/WR laminates subject to fire for small scale heat sources. Substantial savings in the cost of implementation of new applications may be achieved by modelling thermal responses. A thermal model based on a finite difference technique takes into accountt he decompositionp rocessesin the laminate. The thermal model used was an extension of a model already developed by the Composites Group at the University of Newcastle. This model can also be developed to incorporate the responses of composite structures under load.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{critical}} need for {{the development and implementation}} of appro-priate technologies to strengthen, repair and rehabilitate the infrastructure. FHWA studies estimate that the U. S. currently faces a $ 167 billion cost to repair deficient bridges and roads. In many cases, retrofit and rehabilitation by conventional means is very costly (due to both specialized equipment needs and closure of the structure during repair), if not im-possible (e. g., the additional dead load resulting from repair of a deck/beam could very well further damage the structure and cause its final failure). Due to their inherent light-ness, placement flexibility and resistance to corrosion, composites are logical substitutes for steel structural elements often used for the rehabilitation of bridge decks and columns. In this article, we focus on columnar structures where retrofit is needed to strengthen and increase compressive load carrying capacity. The use of a novel resin infusion technique is shown to contribute to substantial improvements in composite wrap efficiency. The use of 24 oz. <b>woven</b> glass <b>roving</b> as the reinforcement in the composite wrap is shown to substantially increase both load carrying capacity and deformation capability of the stubs. It is shown that through the use of glass/carbon hybrids, replication of the initial behavior of concrete is possible, along with a simultaneous improvement in load-carrying capacity (by 72 70 %) and the creation of substantial increase in deformation capacity before failure...|$|R

An advantage {{of this type of}} repair scheme is its simplicity when compared to more traditional schemes such as scarf or step repairs. The stress concentrations around circular holes in glass fiber / vinyl ester <b>woven</b> <b>roving</b> laminates subjected to in-plane shear and bending were calculated before and after repairs using CSM plugs, also of glass fiber / vinyl ester, having varying fiber volume fractions. The laminates were orthotropic and ranged from balanced to unidirectional <b>woven</b> <b>roving,</b> and the CSM plug fiber volume fractions ranged from 0 to 0. 40. For in-plane shear stress, as the plug fiber volume fraction increased from 0 to 0. 40, the maximum stress concentration along the circular holes in the laminate was reduced from about 25 % to 61 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to ascertain the failure modes under different loading speeds along with change in percentage of constituents of FRP composites. This involves experimental investigation of FRP composites with <b>woven</b> <b>roving</b> fibers and matrix. Different types of composites i. e. Glass: Epoxy, Glass: Polyester and (Carbon + Glass) : Epoxy {{are used in the}} investigation with change in percentage of constituents. The variability of fiber content of the composite is in the range of 0. 55 to 0. 65 weight fractions. The matrix dominated property, like inter laminar shear strength has been studied by three point bend test using INSTRON 1195 material testing machine with increasing five cross head velocities. The variation of inter laminar shear strength of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed. The variation of inter laminar shear strengths are observed to be dependent on the type and amount of constituents present in the composites. The laminates with carbon fiber shows higher inter laminar shear strength than that of glass fiber composites. The laminates with epoxy matrix shows higher inter laminar shear strength than polyester matrix composites for the same fiber. There is no significant variation of inter laminar shear strength beyond loading speed 200 mm/min and this can be used for specifications of testing. Matrix resins such as polyester and epoxy are known to be highly rate sensitive.

Finally, the value of the permeability thus obtained was validated by comparing the positions obtained by performing the experiments at different process conditions with the positions obtained by simulating the experiments. In this study, <b>woven</b> <b>roving</b> and chopped strand mats of E-class glass fiber and unsaturated polyester resin were used for the experiments. From the results, {{it was found that the}} measured permeabilities were consistent with varying process conditions. POLYM. COMPOS., 2012. (c) 2012 Society of Plastics Engineer...|$|E
