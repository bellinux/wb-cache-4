5|$|Although a {{state of}} {{hostilities}} existed between the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K'iche' allies prior to European contact, when the conquistadors arrived there was {{a shift in the}} political landscape. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb'il B'alam was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj while he <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> <b>The</b> expedition against Zaculeu was apparently initiated after K'iche' bitterness at their failure to contain the Spanish at Q'umarkaj, with the plan to trap the conquistadors in the city having been suggested to them by the Mam king, Kayb'il B'alam; the resulting execution of the K'iche' kings was viewed as unjust. The K'iche' suggestion of marching on the Mam was quickly taken up by the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Gershkovitch became {{head of the}} Imperial Russian Army's {{military}} symphony orchestra, {{a position}} he held through the Russian Revolution. Army duties continued after the war as concerts were often given as benefits for orphans and the Red Cross, and {{it was during this}} period that Gershkovitch met his future wife Lucia. Then an engineer working on a construction project near Khabarovsk, she had previously been a piano student at the Conservatory during the same period Gershkovitch <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> <b>The</b> two met in 1917, and in 1918 they married in Irkutsk. In Irkutsk, he organized a fine arts conservatory and symphony orchestra. The institute was successful, and by 1920 enrollment had reached more than 1,550 students. Following a successful takeover of the city by the Bolsheviks, Gershkovitch conducted bands for funeral services under the new regime. During a service rehearsal, Gershkovitch removed a man causing numerous interruptions. As a result, Gershkovitch was commanded to visit the Cheka, the presiding chief of which was the victim of the previous day's incident. However, the chief was a devotee of music and requested that Gershkovitch produce a grand opera. He provided a collection of musical instruments previously confiscated by the Bolsheviks. Gershkovitch's conservatory, orchestra, and newly established opera continued under the Bolshevik regime.|$|E

25|$|By 1850 Jung Bahadur had {{eliminated}} all of {{his major}} rivals, installed his own candidate on the throne, appointed his brothers and cronies to all the important posts, and ensured that major administrative decisions were made by himself as prime minister. At this point, he took the unprecedented step of travelling to Britain, France and Egypt leaving from Calcutta in April 1850 and returning to Kathmandu in February 1851. Although he unsuccessfully tried to deal directly with the British government while he <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>the</b> main result of the tour was a great increase in goodwill between the British and Nepal. Recognizing the power of industrialised Europe, he became convinced that close co-operation with the British {{was the best way}} to guarantee Nepal's independence.|$|E

Mussolini arrived punctually at 5 p.m., but nobody from the other side <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> <b>The</b> delegates Cadorna, Lombardi, and Marazza arrived an hour later. Mussolini had a chat with Schuster, and gave him a glass of rosolio to drink and a copy of a book he had written about the life of a saint. Schuster made an effort to preach humility to Mussolini. Later, Graziani and other Fascist leaders arrived, but all the versions given by the people who were present, which include Schuster's, differ greatly from one another.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Arena {{moved back}} to teach at Cornell and act as the school’s {{assistant}} lacrosse coach. While he <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>the</b> University of Virginia (UVA) advertised for two open coaching positions – head soccer coach and assistant lacrosse coach beginning the 1978 season. Arena took that opportunity and {{would go on to}} coach both the UVA lacrosse and soccer teams for seven years, before becoming the school’s dedicated soccer coach in 1985. Arena was the head coach of the Virginia program for eighteen years, during which he won five national championships (including 4 straight from 1991–94) and amassed a 295–58–32 record. Additionally, he coached and developed many players at Virginia who would go on to play significant roles in the United States national team, including Claudio Reyna, Jeff Agoos, Ben Olsen, John Harkes and Tony Meola. In addition to coaching, Arena served as the ACC soccer coaches chairman as well as two three-year terms on the NCAA Division I soccer committee from 1989 to 1995.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Robert Foley {{wrote that}} Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) had {{recently}} been severely criticised by Martin Kitchen, who had written that Schlieffen was a narrow-minded technocrat, obsessed with minutiae. Horst Bucholz had called Moltke too untrained and inexperienced to understand war planning, which prevented him from having a defence policy from 1906 to 1911; it was the failings of both men, that caused them to maintain a strategy that was doomed to fail. Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) {{had good reason to}} retain Vernichtungsstrategie as the foundation of their planning, despite their doubts as to its validity. Schlieffen had been convinced that only in a short war <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>the</b> possibility of victory and that by making the army operationally superior to its potential enemies, Vernichtungsstrategie could be made to work. The unexpected weakening of the Russian army in 1904–1905 and the exposure of its incapacity to conduct a modern war was expected to continue {{for a long time and}} this again made a short war possible. Since the French had a defensive strategy, the Germans would have to take the initiative and invade France, which was shown to be feasible by war games, in which the French border fortifications were outflanked.|$|E

500|$|That {{is not to}} say his operas did {{not come}} as great innovations. What sounds to a modern {{listener}} as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>the</b> empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] is an example of this.|$|E

Since {{they have already}} interviewed Tucker multiple times, the court will not allow him to be bothered anymore {{if he does not}} confess after this interview, and the detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before Tucker walks free. Pembleton starts off acting friendly while Bayliss, who has taken the Watson case very personally, is more aggressive. Adena used to work for Tucker, taking care of his horse. Pembleton brings up Tucker's alcoholism, but Tucker said he gave up drinking because he used to black out, insisting he hasn't had a drink in 16 months. Tucker also insists he hadn't seen Adena for three days before she died, but Bayliss shows him she had soot on her skirt that matched soot from Tucker's barn, indicating she <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>the</b> day she was killed.|$|E

500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history.

[...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he just blew the whistle."

500|$|On 26 August, while {{steaming}} off {{the mouth}} of the Río de la Plata, she caught two more British steamers, but the poor condition of Dresdens engines curtailed further operations.

While en route, Dresden encountered the French steamer Lüdecke refrained from attacking the transport ship, since she had fled into neutral waters. [...] After steaming up the Chilean coast, she stopped in the Juan Fernández Islands, where she made radio contact with the light cruiser , which was operating on the Pacific coast of South America. Dresden saw no further success against British shipping, and on 12 October, she joined Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron, which had crossed the Pacific and was coaling at Easter Island.
