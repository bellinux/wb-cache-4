40|$|Streamflow {{response}} to a rainstorm exceeding a 100 -year return interval is documented {{in relation to the}} peat profile and microtopography. The water tab 1 e:discharge relation is corrected for specific yield and found to closely parallel the stage:discharge relationship for a level reservoir for flows up to a 25 -year return interval. A faster water tab 1 e:discharge relation occurs at higher flows when the mire develops <b>wedge</b> <b>storage</b> in the completely flooded, channel-like lagg around 2 / 3 of the mire perimeter. Flood frequency analysis was used to estimate a 25 -year return interval peak flow of 350 liters per second per sq. km for a 10 -hectare basin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of a}} new class of polymer materials of much recent experimental interest: polymer networks bearing dendritic wedges in the middle of long network strands. We focus on the Rouse dynamics of such cross-linked polymers and perform our study in three steps, considering first single dendritic wedges, then linear chains bearing dendritic wedges (CBDWs), and finally networks formed by end-linked CBDWs. Using analytical and numerical calculations we find that for linear CBDWs increasing the generation number g of dangling dendritic <b>wedges</b> decreases the <b>storage</b> shear modulus G′(ö) in the low-frequency domain, i. e., makes the large-scale relaxation more rapid. The zero shear viscosity also decreases with g, indicating a trend opposite to that of dendrimers with small g. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with recent rheological experimental data on side chain dendritic polymers. On the contrary, increasing g for dendritic wedges attached to regular networks slows down the low-frequency relaxation; this {{goes so far as to}} lead for large g in the intermediate frequency domain to a tendency toward a plateau in G′(ö). We relate these effects to the presence in CBDW systems of the dangling dendritic wedges, which lower the mobility of the linear chains. 1...|$|R
