40|$|Operative (Conservative) {{dentistry}} and endodontics are specialties of dentistry {{where the}} operator {{is exposed to}} various infectious agents either via contact with infected tissues, fluids or aerosol. The potential for cross infection to happen at the dental office is great and every dentist must have a thorough knowledge of the concepts of sterilization and disinfection. Disposables should be used wherever possible. Furthermore, the water supply to the dental chair units and <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> can <b>house</b> biofilms of microbes and {{should be considered as}} possible sources of infection.

40|$|Background and aims. Dental {{handpiece}} is {{a source}} of contamination because it is in constant touch with the oral cavity. Sterilization {{does not seem to be}} sufficient to prevent penetration of microorganisms into air and water lines of the unit, because negative pressure developed by valves (which are placed in <b>water</b> <b>outlets)</b> and post shut-off inertial rotation of handpiece result in water and debris being sucked into air and <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> of dental unit. The aim of this study was to compare dental unit contamination following use of clean head system handpieces and conventional handpieces. Materials and methods. Twenty-two dental units in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in Shahid Beheshti Faculty of Dentistry were used for the purpose of this study. A 1. 5 × 108 cfu/mm 3 concentration of Staphylococcus epidermis (SE) was used to contaminate the air and <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> of dental units. Ten clean head system handpieces and 10 conventional handpieces were used for 30 seconds in the above-mentioned suspension. Microbial samples were collected from the air and water lines. Culturing and colony counting procedures were carried out. Data was analyzed by t-test; a value of p< 0. 01 was considered significant. Results.
