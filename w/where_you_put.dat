And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've got to get God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} series ended, ITV {{announced}} that Broadchurch would {{return for a}} second series. The show's creator, Chris Chibnall, told The Daily Mirror {{in the summer of}} 2013 that [...] "the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events" [...] of series one. Series one actor Will Mellor, who does not appear in series two, strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the second series, while David Tennant told the Associated Press that the series would go in a [...] "very unexpected direction" [...] which he called [...] "as gripping as the first season." [...] Chibnall said he mapped out the show's plot and characters on several whiteboards in his office. [...] "You have to be very methodical," [...] he said about plotting Broadchurch. [...] "It's like a mathematical puzzle <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing." [...] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as [...] "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet – a real shocker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chibnall said he {{mapped out}} the show's plot and {{characters}} on several whiteboards {{in his office}} before beginning the writing process. [...] "You {{have to be very}} methodical," [...] he said about plotting Broadchurch. [...] "It's like a mathematical puzzle <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing." [...] Chibnall was assisted in storyboarding series two by his good friend Sam Hoyle, a television script executive who also worked with him in laying out series one. [...] "By the time I sat down to type scenes and dialogue," [...] Chibnall said, [...] "I'd already done quite a lot of work." [...] As early as mid-July 2013, Chibnall told the Daily Mirror that he had finalised the plot and written the second series' first and last scenes, and was now working {{on the rest of the}} script. Chibnall also said that the second series' themes, story, and basic mysteries are clearly established by the end of the first episode. Much of series two draws on plot elements established in series one. Lead actor Olivia Colman noted [...] "You find out very early in the first episode which direction it's going in and it's an instant, 'Whoooa!'. Chris set up a lot of things we never even thought about in the first series and now they've come to the fore. At the read-through we were going, 'You sneaky b*****d'." [...] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as [...] "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet — a real shocker". Nevertheless, there were constant rewrites of the script as filming occurred.|$|E
