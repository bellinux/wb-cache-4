25|$|In poetry, {{the early}} 18th century was {{an age of}} satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the {{developing}} novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, the pathetic she-tragedy of {{the turn of the}} 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be gentry: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.|$|E
25|$|The Court rejects these claims, {{stating that}} they are not trying to find the {{definition}} of marriage, but are only looking if a proposed meaning is within the definition. The meaning of marriage is not fixed to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> in 1867, but rather it must evolve with Canadian society which currently represents a plurality of groups.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Tansley {{had a dream}} {{where he}} shot his wife. He wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant,</b> so he studied Sigmund Freud. However, one part of Freud's theory was that the human brain is an {{electrical}} machine. Tansley became convinced that, as the brain was interconnected, so was {{the whole of the}} natural world, in networks he called ecosystems, which he believed were inherently stable and self-correcting, and which regulated nature {{as if it were a}} machine.|$|E

The decisions of what a player's proxies are meant to substitute must be made before starting play. If two proxies are meant to substitute different cards, they must be easily distinguishable by looking at their front side.Ideally, the label of a proxy should be enough to tell <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> <b>meant</b> to substitute. Alternatively, a legend or agreement can be used to prohibit players from changing these mappings during play.|$|R

The book {{had been out of}} print for years prior to the movie's release, but the 1998 edition, by Tor Books, reached the New York Times Best Seller list. Tor also published The Path, a nonfiction book in which Matheson expressed his own spiritual beliefs.|$|E

Reille, who carried a letter {{offering}} to surrender. After reading it, von Moltke sent Reille back with a letter of acceptance. Wimpffen was ordered to arrange the surrender. This day, Sedantag in German (French journée de Sedan), became a holiday in the German Empire. The first, brief attempt to avoid disaster through an armistice had failed and the emperor had become a prisoner of war.|$|E

25|$|For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was {{the symbol}} of {{what was wrong with}} the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the {{financial}} difficulties of the nation were placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal, and under the new republican ideas of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{to be a member of}} a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor. The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{approval}} of honor is dependent upon the recognition of others, during ancient times individuals worked hard for {{the approval}} of their peers within their societal cultures. This meant that individuals {{were more likely to}} behave like their honorable counterparts. Groups reinforced <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be honorable through various expected behaviors and goals placed amongst individual members. This discouraged members from any negative activity that may have adversely affected a group or family's honor. In the event that the leader of the group promoted actions that {{did not appear to be}} honorable on a larger societal scale, the leader then offered some explanation defending their actions which lead to the preservation of what they defined as honor and their traditions forever.|$|E
25|$|Arumugam's father Kandhar Pillai was a Tamil poet {{provided}} a foundation in Tamil literature to Arumugam Pillai. His mother Sivakami {{was known for}} her devotion to supreme Saiva deity Lord Siva. Arumugam studied the Indian classical language, Sanskrit as well as Tamil grammar. Arumugam studied English in a Christian mission run school as a day student. After his studies, {{he was asked to}} stay on at the Jaffna Central College to teach English and Tamil. The missionary school principal, Peter Percival also used him to assist in the translation of the King James Bible and other Christian literature. Arumugam worked with Percival from 1841–1848 during which time he formulated his ideas as to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be a modern Hindu, under the influence of a progressive, secular and ascendant Western culture based on Judeo-Christian values.|$|E
25|$|Kenan's first novel, A Visitation of Spirits, was {{published}} in 1989. While a few critics praised the book, it did not receive much attention. This changed with the publication in 1992 of Kenan's second book, {{a collection of short}} stories titled Let the Dead Bury Their Dead. The stories, based in the fictional community of Tims Creek, focused on (among other things) <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be poor, black, and gay in the southern United States. The book was hailed as a revival of classic southern literature and was nominated for the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Fiction, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. The short story collection also brought renewed attention to his first novel, which was likewise set in Tims Creek.|$|E

25|$|Up to this time, Jacob Grimm {{had been}} driven only by a general thirst for knowledge, and his {{energies}} had not found any aim beyond the practical one of making himself a position in life. The first definite impulse came from the lectures of Friedrich Karl von Savigny, the celebrated investigator of Roman law, who first taught him to realize <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to study any science, as Wilhelm Grimm himself says {{in the preface to}} the Deutsche Grammatik (German Grammar). Savigny's lectures also awakened in him a love for historical and antiquarian investigation, which forms the structure of all his work. The two men became personally acquainted, and it was in Savigny's well-stocked library that Grimm first turned over the leaves of Bodmer's edition of the Middle High German minnesingers and other early texts, and felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the obscurities and half-revealed mysteries of their language.|$|E
25|$|Russian historians {{tended to}} focus on the French {{invasion}} of Russia in 1812 and ignore the campaigns in 1813–1814 fought in Germany and France because a campaign fought on Russian soil was regarded as more important than campaigns abroad and because in 1812 the Russians were commanded by the ethnic Russian Kutuzov while in the campaigns in 1813–1814 the senior Russian commanders were mostly ethnic Germans, being either Baltic German nobility or Germans who had entered Russian service. At the time the conception held by the Russian elite was that the Russian empire was a multi-ethnic entity, in which the Baltic German aristocrats in service to the House of Romanov were considered part of that elite-an understanding of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be Russian defined in terms of dynastic loyalty rather than language, ethnicity and culture that does not appeal to those later Russians who wanted to see the war as a purely a triumph of ethnic Russians.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough {{and in the end}} a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt {{it was one of the}} gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1960s, most non-Pentecostal Christians who {{experienced}} the Pentecostal baptism in the Holy Spirit typically kept their experience {{a private matter}} or joined a Pentecostal church afterward. The 1960s saw a new pattern develop where large numbers of Spirit baptized Christians from mainline churches in the US, Europe, {{and other parts of}} the world chose to remain and work for spiritual renewal within their traditional churches. This initially became known as New or Neo-Pentecostalism (in contrast to the older classical Pentecostalism) but eventually became known as the Charismatic Movement. While cautiously supportive of the Charismatic Movement, the failure of Charismatics to embrace traditional Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking alcohol, smoking, and restrictions on dress and appearance initiated an identity crisis for classical Pentecostals, who were forced to reexamine long held assumptions about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> to be Spirit filled. The liberalizing influence of the Charismatic Movement on classical Pentecostalism can be seen in the disappearance of many of these taboos since the 1960s. Because of this, the cultural differences between classical Pentecostals and charismatics have lessened over time. The global renewal movements manifest many of these tensions as inherent characteristics of Pentecostalism and as representative of the character of global Christianity.|$|E

Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E
