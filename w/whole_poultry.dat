40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that older adults' diets can appreciably impact their health. Dietary patterns may better capture the multifaceted effects of diet on health than individual nutrients or foods. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the dietary patterns of a cohort of older adults, and examine relationships with body composition, insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation, and survival. The influence of a polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) gene was considered. Design: The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a prospective cohort study of 3075 older adults. Participants' body composition, genetic variation, glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, and vital status were evaluated in detail. Food intake was assessed with a modified Block food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and dietary patterns were derived by cluster analysis. Results: Six clusters were identified, including a 'Healthy foods' cluster characterized by higher intake of lowfat dairy products, fruit, <b>whole</b> grains, <b>poultry,</b> fish and vegetables. An interaction was found between dietary pattern and PPAR-γ Pro 12 Ala genotype in relation to body composition. While Pro homozygotes in the 'Healthy foods' cluster did not differ significantly in body composition from those in other clusters, men with the Ala allele in the 'Healthy foods' cluster had significantly lower adiposity than those in other clusters. The 'Healthy foods' cluster had lower fasting insulin and HOMA-IR values than the 'High-fat dairy products' and 'Breakfast cereal' clusters, while no differences were found in fasting or 2 -hour glucose. With respect to inflammation, the 'Healthy foods' cluster had lower levels of IL- 6 than the 'High-fat dairy products' and 'Sweets and desserts' clusters, and did not differ in CRP or TNF-α. The 'Healthy foods' cluster also had a lower risk of mortality than the 'High-fat dairy products' and 'Sweets and desserts' clusters, and more years of healthy life and more optimal nutritional status than the other clusters. Conclusion: A dietary pattern consistent with current guidelines to consume relatively high amounts of vegetables, fruit, <b>whole</b> grains, <b>poultry,</b> fish and lowfat dairy products may reduce the metabolic risk and improve the nutritional status, quality of life and survival of older adults...|$|R

40|$|Avians are the {{cornerstone}} of the world of influenza viruses. However other species such as pigs and humans can also be infected by influenza viruses (IV), which established themselves in their mammalian hosts. At irregular intervals, we observed the introduction in pigs or men of new IV, resulting either from an in toto transmission of an avian virus or from a reassortment one involving at least some genomic segments of an avian IV. In humans, such events have been associated with pandemics. The phase of the introduction of a new influenza A virus subtype in humans from the avian reservoir, with or without an intermediate species such as pigs, represents a time for urgent intervention as soon as it is detected.

Safeguarding these concerns presents challenging tasks across the entire farm-fork continuum. This progression is comprised of various segments that include governmental departments, farms, industries, transportation, retail markets and consumers. The devolution of these tasks among the stakeholders and the heterogeneous nature of safety measures at each stage require coherent good management practices. Thus, successful achievements of these need continuous efforts in identifying practical and cost-effective measures for reducing or eliminating food-borne risks to consumers, for example, the Avian H 5 N 1 influenza.

40|$|Protecting {{commercial}} poultry farms Cue: When avian flu first {{broke out in}} Africa, the outbreaks occurred not in backyard birds, but in {{commercial poultry}} flocks. For the owners of large poultry farms, the impact of an avian flu outbreak is devastating. Not only are all their birds slaughtered, but often the public loses confidence in poultry products and the <b>whole</b> <b>poultry</b> sector is affected. Keeping commercial poultry farms free of disease, by tight controls and good hygiene practices is therefore essential. In Malawi the government has established three avian flu rapid response teams, for the three regions of the country. It has also run training workshops for those involved in rearing poultry. Mr Jampa Banda, owner of Tiyanjane Poultry farm near Blantyre, has attended several such workshops. He told Patrick Mphaka about what he is now doing to prevent the disease affecting his farm. IN:		?In general, avian flu can be prevented ?? OUT:		??and that will be terrible. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Jampa Banda, a commercial poultry farmer, was telling Patrick Mphaka about the measures {{that have been taken}} to protect his farm from the risk of avian flu. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Banda	In general, avian flu can be prevented through general cleanliness starting from the infrastructure itself, that?s the cages, as well as the personal hygiene involving all those individuals working in the poultry farm. Mphaka	What changes can I see now if I am to visit and see some of the cages around, see how the chicks are doing? Banda	There are several things which have been implemented. One is the change in the strategy in terms of raising the flocks. Initially we used to have a single flock mixed with the other flocks, may be younger ones, but now, we have to sell one lot before we introduce another one. That?s a major change which is obviously affecting our production, since now we are taking much longer to produce one lot of a flock. Again, we have improved the general hygiene around the poultry farm whereby cleanliness is now taken as a priority {{to make sure that we}} do not contaminate the flocks. And another measure which has been implemented is making sure that the individuals working in the poultry farm don?t keep any poultry at their homes. Now it is like a serious measure which has to be checked. So it?s a general consensus that each worker who is involved in taking care of the flocks should never keep any poultry at his home. And we are also restricting any passers-by to make sure that they do not contaminate our flock or the farm at large. So it?s like a restricted site, much more serious these days than ever before. Mphaka	It must be a big challenge, I suppose, for the workers whom you have because I have seen that as a big poultry farmer, you have some of your workers who stay within the farm itself, they have their houses there, and most of them must have been keeping some poultry themselves. Was there a party where they had to slaughter all their chickens? Banda	Not necessarily a party, but it was a general understanding that if we do not implement these measures, then we both lose; I as the farmer, as well as the workers themselves, eventually we were going to end up both losers. Mphaka	I suppose it must be very hard to follow such rules when you know that avian flu is just something we hear about, it has not hit Malawi yet. How faithful or committed can people be getting such instructions for something they have not seen? Banda	Knowing how dangerous this avian flu can be, then no chances can be spared. As such, each one of us understands that once we are hit, then there will be no escape, that is why we have taken this disease very seriously and we do not want to take any chances. Mphaka	When we were coming in here, before entering, you made sure that I removed my shoes outside and then you disinfected me. How can that help, knowing that there are birds all over around and if any one of them is contaminated or infected, they can come right inside your farm? Banda	There are some measures by which we make sure that the disease never gets into the farm. Some of them are obviously to make sure that our flocks are always kept enclosed in their cages. And we also keep on checking if at all there are any intruding birds coming in; and those are obviously chased out before they can even have a chance to contaminate our flock. But if at all we see any suspicious bird, maybe being weak, or whatever, we make sure that it is immediately quarantined and a veterinary officer called to make sure that he assists and check whatever is happening. Mphaka	Do you believe it will ever come to Malawi, looking at the measures which some of you have taken up and have instituted? Banda	It?s a tricky situation. We definitely do not want to take things for granted and we can not cheat ourselves by saying it will never come here. It was introduced in other areas, therefore, it can as well be introduced in Malawi. That is why we are taking every opportunity to prevent it from coming whilst making sure that if possible, even if it comes, but at least my farm should not be affected by making sure that we implement that advice which has been given by the government. If it ever comes, then it can definitely be a disaster because apart from losing the market, obviously the economy will be affected since people will definitely be terrified and they would not buy even those chickens which are not affected, and that will definitely be very bad for everyone, loss of jobs, loss of business, and that will be terrible.

5000|$|Two {{experimental}} diets {{were selected}} for the DASH study and compared with each other, and with a third: the control diet. The control diet was low in potassium, calcium, magnesium and fiber and featured a fat and protein profile so that the pattern was consistent with a “typical American diet at the time”. The first experimental diet was higher in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet (a “fruits and vegetables diet” [...] ), {{with the exception of}} fewer snacks and sweets. Magnesium and Potassium levels were close to the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption in the fruits-and-vegetables diet, which also featured a high fiber profile. The second experimental diet was high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this diet has been called “the DASH Diet”. The DASH diet (or combination diet) was rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption.

40|$|Hypertension is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Individuals with hypertension are at an increased risk for stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Essential hypertension results from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. One such lifestyle factor is diet, and its role in the control of blood pressure has come under much scrutiny. Just as increased salt and sugar are known to elevate blood pressure, other dietary factors may have antihypertensive effects. Studies including the Optimal Macronutrient Intake to Prevent Heart Disease (OmniHeart) study, Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), International Study of Salt and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study have demonstrated an inverse relationship between dietary protein and blood pressure. One component of dietary protein that may partially account for its antihypertensive effect is the nonessential amino acid cysteine. Studies in hypertensive humans and animal models of hypertension have shown that N-acetylcysteine, a stable cysteine analogue, lowers blood pressure, which substantiates this idea. Cysteine may exert its antihypertensive effects directly or through its storage form, glutathione, by decreasing oxidative stress, improving insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, lowering advanced glycation end products, and modulating levels of nitric oxide and other vasoactive molecules. Therefore, adopting a balanced diet containing cysteine-rich proteins may be a beneficial lifestyle choice for individuals with hypertension. An example of such a diet is the DASH diet, which is low in salt and saturated fat; includes <b>whole</b> grains, <b>poultry,</b> fish and nuts; and is rich in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Individuals with hypertension are at increased risk of stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Although the etiology of essential hypertension has a genetic component, lifestyle factors such as diet play an important role. Reducing dietary salt is effective in lowering blood pressure in salt-sensitive individuals. Insulin resistance and altered glucose metabolism are common features of hypertension in humans and animal models, with or without salt sensitivity. Altered glucose metabolism leads to increased formation of advanced glycation end products. Insulin resistance is also linked to oxidative stress, and alterations in the nitric oxide pathway and renin angiotensin system. A diet rich in protein containing the semiessential amino acid, arginine, and arginine treatment, lowers blood pressure in humans and in animal models. This {{may be due to the}} ability of arginine to improve insulin resistance, decrease advanced glycation end products formation, increase nitric oxide, and decrease levels of angiotensin II and oxidative stress, with improved endothelial cell function and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study demonstrated that the DASH diet, rich in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products; low in fat; and including <b>whole</b> grains, <b>poultry,</b> fish and nuts, lowered blood pressures even more than a typical North American diet with similar reduced sodium content. The DASH diet is rich in protein; the blood pressure-lowering effect of the DASH diet may be due to its higher arginine-containing protein, higher antioxidants and low salt content...|$|R

A total of 388 pregnant women (122 case and 266 control) were included. Dietary intake were collected using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). GDM was diagnosed using a 100 -gram, 3 -hour oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary pattern was identified by factor analysis. To investigate the relation between each of the independent variables with gestational diabetes, the odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Results. Western dietary pattern was high in sweets, jams, mayonnaise, soft drinks, salty snacks, solid fat, high-fat dairy products, potatoes, organ meat, eggs, red meat, processed foods, tea, and coffee.

50|$|Dietary change, {{such as a}} low sodium {{diet and}} a {{vegetarian}} diet are beneficial. A long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet is effective in reducing blood pressure, both in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure. Also, the DASH diet, a diet rich in nuts, <b>whole</b> grains, fish, <b>poultry,</b> fruit and vegetables lowers blood pressure. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium, although the diet is also rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, as well as protein. A vegetarian diet {{is associated with a}} lower blood pressure and switching to such a diet may be useful for reducing high blood pressure. A review in 2012 found that a diet high in potassium lowers blood pressure in those with high blood pressure and may improve outcomes in those with normal kidney function, while a 2006 review found evidence to be inconsistent; additionally, the review found no significant reduction in blood pressure overall for people with high blood pressure who were given oral potassium supplementation. Meta-analyses conducted by the Cochrane Hypertension group have found no evidence of an appreciable blood pressure reduction from any combination of calcium, magnesium or potassium supplements; this information stands contrary to prior systematic reviews suggesting that a dietary intake adjustment for each of these may benefit adults with high blood pressure. While weight loss diets reduce body weight and blood pressure, it is unclear if they reduce negative outcomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of Listeria in marinade used to inject fresh <b>whole</b> muscle <b>poultry</b> products poses {{a potential threat}} to processors. In an attempt to offer {{a solution to this}} problem, two representative samples (20 gallons each) of fresh poultry marinade solution were collected on two separate days from a USDA-inspected poultry processing facility and were shipped overnight to MCA Services (Rogers, AR) under refrigerated conditions. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the marinade solutions were inoculated with overnight cultures of Listeria innocua to a level (colony forming units) of 5. 0 logs per mL (Trial 1) or 6. 6 logs per mL (Trial 2) of marinade solution. The inoculated marinade was then passed through a Fresh Light ® 210 ultraviolet light system (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) for 20 minutes (flow rate = 8 gallons per minute and solution turnover time = 2. 5 minutes). Samples of the marinade were collected at 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5, 15 and 17. 5 minutes which corresponded to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 passes through the ultraviolet light system. Aerobic Plate Count Petrifilm™ 3 was utilized to determine log reductions in Listeria innocua due to the ultraviolet light treatment. In both trials, after only 2. 5 minutes of ultraviolet light exposure (1 pass through the ultraviolet light system), a > 2. 2 log reduction was achieved in the level of the inoculated culture in the marinade solution. At 10 minutes of exposure (4 passes), a 4 log or greater reduction was achieved in both trials. After 15 minutes (5 passes), Listeria innocua could not be recovered from the marinade solution in either of the two trials (the lower detection level for the organism was 1 log colony forming unit per mL). Thus, in 15 minutes of ultraviolet light system exposure, the total level of Listeria innocua in the poultry marinade was reduced in linear fashion from 5 logs per mL (Trial 1) or 6 logs per mL (Trial 2) to less than 1 log per mL (no detectable organisms). This represents a > 99. 99 % to a > 99. 999 % reduction in the original starting level of inoculum in the poultry marinade solutions. In conclusion, the commercially available Fresh Light ® 210 ultraviolet light system (FDA regulated under 21 CFR 179. 39) offers an extremely effective means for controlling and eliminating the incidence and levels of Listeria innocua in poultry marinade solutions at a very low cost to the processor...|$|R
40|$|Whole grain feeding has {{recently}} received {{renewed interest in}} the commercial poultry industry as a mean of lowering feed manufacturing cost. Wheat is the cereal grain of choice for whole grain feeding, {{despite the fact that}} globally maize is the most commonly cereal grain. Published data on the use of <b>whole</b> maize in <b>poultry</b> diets are scant. The size of maize grain may be the major reason for the lack of interest in feeding whole maize. The first three experiments of the thesis investigated alternative feeding strategies such as pre-pelleting inclusion or minor modifications such as cracking or coarser grinding to overcome the issue of maize kernel size. Experiment four evaluated whole wheat (WW) feding and examined the interaction between pellet diameter (3. 0 vs 4. 76 mm) and method of wheat inclusion (ground wheat (GW) or WW pre-and post-pelleting). The intention of using a larger pellet die was to retain the larger wheat particle size in pellets. Experiment five investigated the effect of whole wheat feeding in broilers experimentally challenged with a mixed infection of Eimeria. Pre-pelleting inclusion of 0 to 600 g/kg whole maize replacing (w/w) ground maize in broiler starter diets showed that the weight gain of broilers was poorer despite improvements in gizzard development, nutrient utilisation and pellet quality (Chapter 4). Poor weight gain was due largely to reduced feed intake. Inclusion of 0 to 600 g/kg coarse maize, replacing (w/w) finely-ground maize, in broiler diets in mash form from day 11 to 35 post-hatch resulted in improvements in weight gain and gizzard weight without any negative effect on nutrient utilisation and carcass yield (Chapter 5). Increased caecal counts of beneficial bacteria Lactobacilli spp. and Bifidobacteria spp. and decreased counts of Clostridium spp., Campylobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. were also reported. Similarly, feeding diets containing 0 to 600 g/kg coarse maize to laying hens, from 39 to 62 weeks of age, had no adverse effects on any production parameters and egg quality (Chapter 6). These results indicated that ground maize in broiler and layer diets could be completely replaced by coarsely ground maize with no adverse effects of bird performance.. Data reported in Chapter 7 showed that the effect of pellet diameter on broiler performance varied depending on the form of wheat and method of WW inclusion. Larger pellet diameter increased the weight gain and lowered feed per gain of birds fed diets with GW and post-pellet inclusion of WW. However, in birds fed diets with pre-pelleting inclusion of WW, the larger pellet diameter lowered weight gain and increased feed per gain, due largely to reduced feed intake which may be attributed partly to poorer pellet quality. Relative gizzard weight was increased by larger pellet diameter with pre-pelleting inclusion of WW, but was unaffected by diets containing GW or post pelleting inclusion of WW. Larger pellet diameter increased the apparent metabolisable energy and ileal starch digestibility, irrespective of method of WW inclusion. These results suggested that, irrespective of whether the wheat grain was milled or added whole post-pelleting, a larger diameter pellet was beneficial. On the other hand, when WW was added pre-pelleting, a smaller diameter pellet resulted in improved weight and feed per gain in broiler performance. In the final experiment (Chapter 8), broilers fed WW either pre-or post-pelleting and experimentally challenged with a mixed Eimeria infection at 21 day of age showed that mortality in challenged birds was highest in those fed diets with WW post-pelleting, followed by pre-pelleted WW and GW (58, 35, and 17 %, respectively). The pattern of mortality paralleled the changes in gizzard size, which suggested that WW feeding exacerbated the severity of coccidiosis infection, possibly via a mechanism involving enhanced gizzard development...|$|R
