40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{significant}} fouling by particulate matter can have a deleterious effect on the performance of enhanced surface heat exchangers, and {{the same is true for}} hybrid heat exchangers. Hybrid heat exchangers are heat exchangers which are typically run in dry mode to reject heat. When the ambient conditions require more heat rejection than can be provided by sensible heat transfer a water pump is turned on and water flows over the fins and the evaporation of water provides a further cooling effect. Fouling in dry mode operation is physically similar to that of air-cooled heat exchangers, but in evaporative mode the flow of the water over the coil eliminates the impact of fouling. A hybrid dry cooler heat exchanger of 60 cm x 60 cm frontal area has been installed in a well-instrumented wind tunnel to measure the heat exchanger’s performance. Hot water flows through the coil to provide the load, and air flows over the coil to provide cooling. During evaporative mode operation another stream of water flows over the outside face of the coil, adhering mainly to the louvered fins. The louvered fins are specially designed for optimized water flow during wetting mode. The fins are made of aluminum, the tubes are copper, and protection against corrosion is realized by a special E-coating. This coil has been tested clean and fouled with ASHRAE standard dust, for both dry and <b>wet</b> <b>operation.</b> Results are presented for the air side pressure drop and overall heat transfer conductance of the coil under all conditions for which 50 % increases in air-side pressure drop are found under heavy fouling.

40|$|Despite {{appearing}} as a promising technology for distributed generation, micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) {{have not yet}} managed to penetrate the small-scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) market. The energy efficiency of mGTs amounts to 80 % whenever both heat and electricity are required. However, when the heat demand is low, the hot exhaust gases have to be directly blown off and the electrical efficiency of the unit (∼ 30 %) is not high enough to sustain profitable operation. Water injection, achieved when transforming the mGT into a micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT), allows making use of the exhaust gas heat in such cases, thus increasing electrical efficiency of the technology and improving its feasibility. Although the enhanced performance of the mHAT cycle has been thoroughly investigated from a numerical point of view, results regarding the experimental behaviour of this technology remain scarce. In this paper, we present the experimental characterisation of the mHAT located at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) {{which is based on}} the T 100 mGT equipped with a spray saturation tower. These are the first experimental results of such an engine working at nominal load with water injection. In addition, the control system of the unit has been modified so that it can operate either at constant electrical power output (the default setting) or at constant rotational speed. The latter option allowed better assessing the effect of water injection. Experimental results demonstrate the patent benefits of water injection on mGT performance: at fixed rotational speed, the power output of the mHAT increases by more than 30 % while fuel consumption rises only by 11 %.

It is applied at the last stage of manufacturing process so that the high dimensional accuracy and desirable surface finish product can be achieved. However, {{there is a lot of}} problem occur in order to achieve the high dimensional accuracy and desirable surface finish. For examples, surface burning due to excessive heat produce and undesirable surface finish outcomes. The work presented in this paper aims at evaluating the surface temperature after grinding as well as the surface finish of the Stainless Steel AISI 304 grinds with Aluminium Oxide wheel by study the effect of the independent variable such as depth of cut (μm), table speed (m/s), and grinding passes. This experiment is held in two conditions which are dry and wet grinding with every condition is 18 runs of experiments. Soluble oil is used at wet grinding. The grindability results have shown that while dry grinding generates higher surface temperature and higher surface finish of the Stainless Steel workpiece rather than wet grinding. In comparison with independent variables, it is found that, the depth of cut can be labelled as the predominant effect to the rise of surface temperature and higher surface roughness of the Stainless Steel workpiece for both conditions. At the constant depth of cut, varied table speed and grinding passes, it is found that at the lowest table speed will generate higher surface temperature and smoother surface roughness for both of the experiments. In the case of grinding passes, higher surface temperature and smoother surface roughness is generated at the higher number of grinding passes for both the experiments. By the end of the thesis, grinding in <b>wet</b> <b>operation,</b> with lowest depth of cut (10 μm), minimum table speed (10 m/s) and higher grinding passes (2 passes) are recommended to grind Aluminium Oxide wheel with Stainless Steel AISI 304 to obtain the satisfied surface temperature (30. 4 oC) and surface roughness (1. 433 μm) ...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{potential}} of micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) for Combined Heat and Power (CHP), this technology still poses limitations that curb its widespread adoption, especially for applications with a variable heat demand. In fact, whenever the user heat demand is low, mGTs are generally shut down. Otherwise, the high temperature exhaust gases have to be blown off and the resulting electrical efficiency is not high enough to sustain a profitable operation. If, instead of released, the heat in the exhaust gases is re-inserted in the cycle — by injecting hot water and transforming the mGT into a micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT) — the electrical efficiency can be increased during periods of reduced heat demand, thus improving {{the economics of the}} technology. Although the enhanced performance of the mHAT cycle has been thoroughly investigated from a numerical point of view, results regarding the experimental behaviour of this technology remain scarce. In this paper, we present the experimental characterisation of the mHAT located at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) : based on the T 100 mGT and equipped with a spray saturation tower.

40|$|From all fossil fuels, {{natural gas}} {{has the lowest}} carbon to {{hydrogen}} ratio, which enables Gas Turbines (GTs) running on natural gas to produce electricity with the lowest CO 2 emissions per produced kWh. These lower emissions have pushed power production towards natural gas. However, {{if we want to}} move towards a carbon clean power production, the carbon in the exhaust must be captured. This leads to a major challenge since the low CO 2 concentration in the exhaust of a GT makes carbon capture much more expensive compared to coal fired power production. The CO 2 concentration can be increased by performing Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). However, EGR on GT cycles negatively affects the efficiency. Using the concept of Humid Air Turbine (HAT), we investigate whether the efficiency losses can be compensated by introducing water in the cycle. This paper presents this novel approach by showing the impact of EGR on a flexible humidified micro Gas Turbine (mGT). It is based on results of simulations performed in Aspen® using the Turbec T 100 mGT as reference case. Both the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>operation</b> of the Turbec T 100 were simulated and validated with experimental results. For improved carbon capture, EGR was simulated in both the dry and the humidified mGT cycle. Simulation results indicate that EGR has no effect on the thermodynamic performance of the mGT and its components (compressor, turbine and recuperator), however efficiency is reduced significantly (up to 3. 8 % relative at nominal power output) because of additional losses to the fan blower installed to ensure the EGR. Additionally, the cycle performance strongly depends on the degree of cooling of the EGR stream before injection in the compressor inlet. Nevertheless, the simulation results also reveal that mGT humidification increases the total cycle efficiency, entirely compensating the EGR induced losses. Humidifying the mGT with EGR even leads to a higher electric efficiency than the standard mGT cycle, unlocking the idea of carbon capture in mGTs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 Dry run {{failures}} in sealless pumps {{continue to be}} of major concern to users and, in some cases, have precluded the purchase {{of these types of}} pumps. Users are demanding robust pump designs that are more tolerant of dry running caused by system upsets and occasional operator error. Although silicon carbide is the best material choice for product lubricated bearings during normal <b>wet</b> <b>operation,</b> it will quickly overheat and seize in a matter of seconds, if allowed to run dry. There are other bearing material choices available, such as carbon-graphite and various polymer materials that will permit some degree of short term dry running, but sacrifices must be made in wear resistance, chemical inertness, and/or load carrying capability. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the bone-dry run performance of amorphous diamond-like carbon (ADLC) coated silicon carbide bearings both with and without Teflon lubricating strips. The test pump was a 1. 5 X 1 X 6 ANSI magnetic drive pump fitted with a nonconductive containment shell and rated for 7. 5 hp at 3600 rpm. Ten bearing configurations were tested, including repeatability tests, cycle tests, and tests with covered suction and discharge flanges to eliminate the effect of air cooling. A baseline test was conducted for silicon carbide without the ADLC coating or Teflon strips in order to determine survivability under bone-dry run conditions. Not surprisingly, this configuration seized in under five sec operation and sustained the most massive damage of all configurations tested. Results showed that the configuration with ADLC SiC(P) bearings and Teflon lubricating strips was superior to all configurations tested. During this test, the maximum bearing temperature leveled off at 139 degrees F after five hours of bone-dry run operation. This configuration had the longest operating time, lowest temperature rise, and least wear of all configurations tested. An examination showed that the SiC bearings had virtually no damage and it was expected that this configuration could have continued to run bone-dry for many more hours. The bearing configuration with ADLC SiC(P) without Teflon strips also performed well and had an average bone-dry run time of 142 min prior to reaching the 300 degree F bearing temperature limit previously set for terminating the test. Post-test bearing condition for this configuration was good with only light to moderate scoring evident. It was found through repeatability testing that the dry run performance of the ADLC coating SiC(P) bearings was reasonably consistent. Prior experience with this coating indicated that it had significantly contributed to a 62 percent reduction in failure rate, during a frequency of repair audit at a large German chemical plant...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{intake air}} {{filtration}} {{is a key}} element for limiting fouling, erosion, and corrosion in the compressor section and hot corrosion in the hot section of offshore gas turbine installations. Current intake air systems on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) are normally able to prevent serious corrosion and erosion problems in the compressor section and ensure acceptable service intervals for the hot section of the gas turbines, but compressor fouling remains a challenge. This compressor fouling occurs despite the presence of “state-of-the-art” intake air filtration systems. The performance deterioration caused by compressor fouling increases fuel consumption and emissions and has a particularly severe economic impact when it reduces the maximum available power from the gas turbine and consequently reduces oil and gas production. The main objective of this work is to determine the performance of current intake air filters offshore and their influence on gas turbine performance. The work is empirical, and the empirical data have been obtained from offshore installations, from tests performed on a GE J 85 - 13 jet engine at Kjeller, Norway, and from experimental tests on filter elements in a test rig at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The filter test rig was designed and built as part of this work. The work has confirmed that considerable amounts of contaminants build up in the compressor section of offshore gas turbines despite the presence of state-of-the-art filtration systems, causing deterioration in gas turbine performance. It has been determined through analysis of compressor fouling in different offshore gas turbine engines that sodium-based salts are the dominant component of the fouling, and the influence of the observed contamination levels on gas turbine performance has been determined. The extensive test program on different types of deteriorated filter elements from offshore service has revealed that accumulated salt and other contaminants are shed from the filters and re-entrained into the airflow on the downstream side of the filters when they are exposed to wet/humid operating conditions. The relationship between ingested amount of water and shed contamination from the filter elements as well as the influence on differential pressure drop over the filters have been quantified. The review of offshore filter performance and experimental testing have documented that the current practice for condition monitoring of intake filter performance by monitoring the total pressure drop over the intake filters is inadequate. The re-entrainment of accumulated particles into the downstream side of the filter elements causes a significant change in the pressure drop characteristics for some types of filter elements. After such incidents, an apparent improvement in filter performance in terms of reduced pressure drop will be accompanied by an increase in compressor fouling. The work has also revealed significant variations in the level of accumulated particle mass and differential pressure drop among filter elements from the same installation. Such variations may cause some filter elements to operate outside of their design criteria and will normally not be discovered by monitoring the total pressure loss over the intake filters. A thorough review of current international standards and available filter manufacturer specifications for intake air treatment systems has documented important shortcomings in how offshore-specific challenges pertaining to intake air filtration for gas turbines are handled and has revealed a need for new or improved standards for gas turbine intake systems offshore. No international standard for evaluating and documenting the performance of the complete gas turbine intake air systems in offshore applications exists. Applicable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) air filtration standards for filter elements fail to address the offshore-specific challenges related to salt removal and moist and <b>wet</b> <b>operation</b> and cannot be used to accurately predict operational performance or life. Some suppliers of filter elements for offshore gas turbine application also choose not to test their filters in accordance with these standards. An international standard for offshore gas turbine air intake systems is needed {{in order to ensure that}} the specific challenges that stem from operating in an offshore environment are handled in a responsible manner. Such a standard should take a holistic approach to the intake air system rather than solely focusing on some specific components or conditions. Experimental performance evaluation of used filters from offshore service and filters exposed to accelerated deterioration in the laboratory has increased the knowledge of intake filter deterioration in offshore applications and created a basis for establishing guidelines and requirements for future standards for offshore gas turbine intake filters and systems. The accelerated saltwater deterioration method developed and applied in this work was effective in revealing significant variations in how new filters performed when exposed to this challenge. Saltwater ingestion caused filter performance to deteriorate within a short time frame, and the recorded increases in differential pressure drop were within the range of differential pressure drops recorded for used filters from offshore operation.

A tread pattern which has transverse grooves across the entire width of the tread improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded runway surface.
