25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. <b>Walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he stepped back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E

And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." [...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the [...] "floodgates" [...] to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E

I'm <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole.

So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. [...] "It was obvious I was gonna ask her to do it", Stefani stated {{in an interview with}} VH1's Box Set. The video follows the song's theme and depicts the relationship that Stefani has with a former boyfriend, who is played by Spanish actor Daniel González. González and his new girlfriend—played by Tony Kanal's girlfriend, Erin Lokitz—are shown <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a villa where Stefani answers the door. The villa featured in the video is the Villa Erba, in the town of Cernobbio, which Stefani said was [...] "so beautiful". The three of them are seen in each other's company, with intercut scenes of Stefani singing on a bed. There are flashbacks to the time when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, where she has brunette hair. Flashbacks and present day images are linked with match cut cinematography. The lyrical theme of [...] "Cool" [...] is maintained in the video; frames are incorporated to portray Stefani feeling [...] "cool". She is depicted as cool with her former boyfriend and his girlfriend throughout most of the video.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} short {{trailers}} for [...] "Trampoline", getting gradually longer in length, teased different {{sections of the}} instrumental and music video. Each teaser features the Demonstration insignia, which is a horizontal red stripe going through {{the centre of the}} artwork. The first teaser was five seconds long and simply a synth and sub drop. The second is seventeen seconds long and shows a hanging microphone, accompanied by slightly more of the track. The third shows a hooded Tinie, accompanied by a different section of the track. At the end Tinie says [...] "yeah". The fourth and final trailer was released a day prior to the premiere of the track, and includes part of the chorus. It shows Tinie <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the camera and grinning. The album artwork and artwork for each of the singles feature the red stripe, and even the colour two-tone vinyl has a red stripe going across it. The stripe also features on the physical disc. Tinie teamed up with Warner Music Group to develop the Tinie Tempah: Rap Demonstration app for the iTunes Store, released on 5 February 2014. The app uses recordings of Tempah's mouth rapping the album in its entirety, and the idea is that you can rap along to it.|$|E

40|$|The walking {{speed of}} {{passengers}} {{is important in}} estimating the time re-quired to evacuate a ship. Therefore we investigated the walking speed on stairs and in corridors during ship listing and dynamic ship motion condi-tions, using the TNO Ship Motion Simulator. Data were obtained from sub-jects between 18 and 83 years of age. Ship listing reduced <b>walking</b> speed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> about 35, dependent on the direction of tilt. Seniors were about 15 slower than other age categories. Ascending stairs slowed down <b>walking</b> speed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 for all age categories, descending <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30. Another find-ing was that people needed the handrail during ship listing. This imposes a considerable reduction on the specific flow through the escape ways. Dy-namic ship movements slowed down <b>walking</b> speed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 with in-creasing frequency and with increasing amplitude. At large eccentric posi-tions, parasitic linear accelerations will be the main factor reducing specific flow: passengers need handrails if these accelerations exceed 0. 5 m/s². For the purpose of predicting the time required for evacuations, the reduction in passenger walking speed and the reduced capacity of escape ways {{should be taken into}} account in the IMO guidelines...|$|R

The installation of a security fence along the 400 kilometre Georgian-South Ossetian administrative boundary line (ABL) had a huge impact on the lives of local people. The EUMM representative said: [...] "Just <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the fence means you’ve already crossed over and will be arrested." [...] According to EUMM spokesperson Ann Vassen, the detention cases were around five to six per week in early 2014. The Georgian Government estimated that the total length of the barbed wire installations along the South Ossetian ABL was about 50km by April 2014.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} {{functions}} of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species. [...] The amygdala communicates both directions between the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, the sensory cortex, the hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and the [...] brainstem. The amygdala {{plays an important role}} in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for associative learning, and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response. Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of patient S.M.). This impairment can cause different species to lack the sensation of fear, and often can become overly confident, confronting larger peers, or <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> predatory creatures.|$|E

Three of the people killed had no association with either gangs and according to Pierre McSween he did not consider them [...] "cool" [...] killers because they just walked in and sprayed the place instead of <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the person they wished to execute and shooting them in the back of the head so no one else would get hurt. The target that evening was Roger [...] "Birdie" [...] Letourneau who was a former member of the gang before the Dubois Brothers took over.

2500|$|In 2005, Oleg Riabov, {{a fellow}} {{academic}} and publisher, commissioned Moskvin to summarize and list {{the dead in}} more than 700 cemeteries in forty regions of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. Moskvin claimed to have gone on foot to inspect 752 cemeteries across the region from 2005 to 2007, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30km (18.6 miles) a day. During these travels, he drank from puddles, spent nights in haystacks and at abandoned farms, or slept in the cemeteries themselves, even {{going so far as}} to spend a night in a coffin being prepared for a funeral. Moskvin also claimed that on his extensive travels he was sometimes questioned by police on the suspicion of vandalism and theft, but that he was never arrested or reprimanded.

2500|$|The {{music video}} is {{invariably}} Atomic Kitten's most famous music video {{due to the}} fact of band member Natasha Hamilton being heavily pregnant in the video. The music video begins with the group <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the screen. A flashing rainbow {{can be seen in the}} background, behind the scenes shots are behind a green screen.

2500|$|The {{plan was}} to have the nine {{children}} arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth {{to be the first to}} take a different route to school, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford’s family were not informed of the meeting, and didn’t know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school.

As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration.

2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the door of my house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away.
