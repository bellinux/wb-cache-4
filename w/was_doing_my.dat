500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{duty to the}} village, {{and still}} more I <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty to an old friend, and I am not likely ever to feel any regret that I have so acted.

60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to skim {{through this}} bright little volume {{when the bell}} rang. I crawled off the sofa and opened the door. A kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{business}} {{in my own}} way. And I suppose your present announcement," [...] Strether went on, [...] "isn't merely the result of your sense of what I've expected. Otherwise you wouldn't have put me in relation--" [...] But he paused, pulling up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think that}} I'm given to be afraid,' said Bagwax. 'The ocean, if I know myself, {{would have no}} terrors for me;--not if I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty. But I should hear the ship's sides {{cracking}} with every blast if that secret were lodged within my breast.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, but {{you don't}} know me. I ain't so green as I look by no manner o' means. I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> own {{housekeeping}} for four terms." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By {{feeling that}} I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged {{me to be}} secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which {{it could not be}} in my power to satisfy." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{continued}} {{walking in}} this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>My</b> heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: ...|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{best with}} the lump of liver, that tasted painfully of vatdoek and was gritty with sand.

6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what the sherry said to the man when he was just going to drink it?" [...] inquired Fenn. [...] "It said, 'Nemo me impune lacessit'. That's how I feel.

6000|$|... 'I {{thought much}} of it when he bowed to me. I little fancied--but there was another odd coincidence--wasn't it? In general I never go into the drawing-room to company, because there are three older; but the day they came to speak to papa about the fishing, mamma and all the elder ones {{were out of the}} way, except Matilda. I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> Roman history with her, when papa came in and said, we must both come into the drawing-room.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{am afraid}} I {{must be at}} bottom, what a cheerful Indian critic has dubbed me, 'a faddling hedonist,' for this {{description}} of the brother's motives gave me somewhat of a shock. I should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake, and not for ulterior purposes; and this shows how profoundly I was out of sympathy with these good Trappists, even when I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to sympathise. But to the cure the argument seemed decisive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She has {{not invited}} me!...

I admit the words were harsh, but I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty, and if the case arose to-morrow I would do it again.
