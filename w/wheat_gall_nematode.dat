40|$|Path {{analysis}} was used to assess the efficacy of the fiddleneck flower <b>gall</b> <b>nematode</b> as a weed biocontrol agent of coast fiddleneck in competition with wheat during 2 yr of field experiments. The path analysis revealed that the number of inflorescences/plant for fiddleneck and the number of heads/plant for wheat were the most important yield components that determine fecundity and seed yield. The density of fiddleneck had a much greater impact on the yield components of fiddleneck than did the density of wheat or the nematode rate of inoculation. The nematode had its greatest negative impact on the number of seeds/flower of fiddleneck and its greatest positive impact on the number of heads/plant of wheat. Path analysis predicts that a biocontrol agent that has a large negative direct effect on the number of inflorescences/plant for fiddleneck would be more efficacious in decreasing fecundity and seed yield than an agent that only impacts the number of flowers/ inflorescence, seeds/flower, or biomass/seed.

40|$|Methods for {{evaluating}} the efficacy of potential classical biocontrol agents were outlined for a model biocontrol agent-weed-crop system. A proposed biocontrol agent (the fiddleneck flower <b>gall</b> <b>nematode),</b> its weed host (coast fiddleneck), and wheat were used as representative organisms. An additive experimental design (inverse linear model) was used. Regression of the reciprocal of the average plant biomass of each species onto the density of itself and the other plant species yielded competitive indices that measure the competitive ability of the plants. The results of two years of field experiments revealed {{a dramatic change in}} the competitive interaction between fiddleneck and wheat due to the nematode. During the 1986 - 1987 season {{in the absence of the}} nematode, fiddleneck intraspecific competition was 33 times stronger than interspecific competition with wheat. In the presence of the nematode, intra- and interspecific competition of fiddleneck were nearly equal.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] - The {{root knot}} {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne spp.) are important group of plant parasitic nematodes which poses threat to tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production. The {{study was conducted}} in shade net house located at the Agronomy Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University for Development Studies, Nyankpala from September to December, 2011 to investigate the effect of inoculum densities of root knot nematodes on the growth of tomato cv. Pectomec and the inoculum level that will cause the highest nematode infestations. The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with four treatments and replicated four times. The inoculum levels were: 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 freshly hatched second stage juveniles (J 2) of root knot nematodes / 1 kg soil/pot. All pots were inoculated with root knot nematode J 2 a week after transplanting of the tomato seedlings. Data were taken on plant girth, plant height, number of leaves, root <b>galls,</b> <b>nematode</b> eggs population density and root weights (fresh and dry weights). From the results obtained, it was observed that all the inoculum levels reduced the stem girth, plant height, number of leaves, and fresh and dry root weights. Increasing the nematode inoculum level resulted in corresponding increased in number of <b>galls</b> and <b>nematode</b> population build up.

Within the <b>gall,</b> <b>nematodes</b> progress through three molts to reach adulthood (J3, J4, male and female adults). Reproduction is amphimictic and females can lay up to 1000 eggs. The first molt occurs in the egg and the nematode hatches as a J2. These juveniles undergo anhydrobiosis and become the dormant dauer larvae to withstand the hot summer heat of Australia. Autumn rains rehydrate the dauer juveniles which become active to begin the life cycle over again. [...] Only one generation is produced per year.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{efficacy}} of Paecilomyces lilacinus strain UP 1 as {{biological control agent}} of Meloidogyne incognita attacking tomato was evaluated under screenhouse condition pot experiments. P. lilacinus was formulated on rice substrate in powder form. Root weight, gall index rating, number of galls, egg masses and nematodes per one gram root sample were determined and per cent reduction in gall number was computed. Root weight and gall index ratings were significantly higher in untreated plants than those with P. lilacinus and with the commercial fungicide Nemacur. Number of <b>galls,</b> <b>nematodes</b> and egg masses per one gram root sample were significantly reduced by the application of P. lilacinus at all levels and this was comparable with Nemacur. However, egg mass count in plants treated with the lowest concentration of the biocontrol agent was {{not significantly different from}} the uninoculated control.

40|$|The {{presence}} of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on the cuticular {{surface of the}} seed <b>gall</b> <b>nematodes</b> Anguina agrostis and Anguina tritici was demonstrated, {{and the nature of}} its binding was examined. Crude extracts from the cuticles of A. tritici agglutinated human red blood cells, and only N-acetylglucosamine (GlucNAc) inhibited the agglutination. Distribution of the lectin was visualized by treating live infective juveniles (J 2) with rabbit anti-WGA antibody and staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The lectin bound to the outer cuticular surface of the whole body wall. Pretreatment with GlucNAc oligomers did not reduce the fluorescence created by the anti-WGA-WGA binding, indicating at least a partial nonspeciflc adhesion of the WGA to the nematode surface. Proteolytic enzyme pretreatments diminished the fluorescence, whereas lipase and periodate pretreatments increased the fluorescence. Adult females and males were labeled only on the head and tail, whereas eggs were not labeled at all. It was concluded that the WGA on the J 2 cuticle originates from the host...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first thing}} {{recommendation}} {{to control the}} <b>gall</b> <b>nematodes</b> is to plant healthy seeds in area not infested. Nematode-free seeds are important to avoid disseminating the pathogen to other areas. However, if areas are already contaminated, other measures will be needed.Some nematicides are still applied to stop J2 from infecting coffee plants. However, due phytotoxicity and high value their use became unpractical. Thus, new cultural methods started to be applied such as irrigation control, remove diseased plants, spacing rows and others not as common. M. exigua can survive for six months without the host, while M. coffeicola just survive for few days or weeks. Thus, not planting host plants for a period greater than six months can eradicate both plant feeders. Grafting [...] is another method applied to control Meloidogyne species that attacks coffee. Resistant varieties are used as a support (stock) such Apoatã, which will provide nutrients to the other variety on the top (scion) such Mundo Novo, {{that will be the}} one with flower and coffee fruit production.

This work demonstrates that impeding cell cycle progression by means of ICK 1 /KRP 1 and ICK 2 /KRP 2 overexpression severely restricts gall development, leading to a marked limitation of root-knot nematode development and reduced numbers of offsprin...|$|R

Treatment with Furadan- 3 G as side-dressing after 7 and 14 days of inoculation gave the best response in plant growth characters including nodulation correspondingly {{with the lowest}} number of galls, adult females and different juvenile stages of the nematode within the treated plants. Neem oil gave better effect with the reduction of <b>galls</b> and <b>nematode</b> population like that of Furadan- 3 G. Garlic bulb extract showed comparatively higher response in promoting plant growth and suppressing the nematode. Good effects were observed with the oil cakes of mustard and til...|$|R
40|$|With growing {{interest}} in biological control, {{it is time to}} take stock of recent successful experiences in the use of living organisms to prevent or minimise damage caused by insect pests. In Jamaica, a beetle known as the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) causes considerable losses in coffee plantations each year. In a pilot project, 25, 000 hymenoptorous (membrane-winged) insects (Cephalonomia stephanoderis) were released in the plantations to attack the coffee berry borer s larvae. Results have been positive and now plans are being made to release another insect the Phymasticus caffea to attack the adult pests. In the northern Pacific, the major trouble-maker is the azalea whitefly (Aleurodicus dispersus), which thrives during periods of drought and attacks a multitude of plants. Its proliferation can be halted by a wasp (Encarsia haitiensis) which feeds on its larvae. Wasps are in favour in Papua New Guinea too, in particular the Trichogramma plassyensis which has been released en masse to parasite the eggs of the maize borer (Ostrinia furnacalis). Special training has even been provided to extension workers in the use of another wasp, Diadegma semiclausen, to attack cabbage pests, cabbage being a widely grown crop on the high plateaus. In South Africa, worms have been left to get on with biological control and eat worms. The microscopic nematode worms feed by perforating plant cells. In sugar cane plantations, another type of worm, Helicotylenchus dihystera, have been use to control them and minimise damage. In Senegal, a bacterium (Pasteuria penetrans) is being tested to parasite the <b>gall</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Meloidogyne spp) which ruin market garden vegetables. Progress is being made in the best conditions for this bacterium to develop, such as mixed cultivation of vegetables, groundnuts and cereals, and the preferred composition of the soil, which is ideally sandy, with 10 % clay content. All in all, biocontrol is scoring a lot of points. With {{growing interest}} in biological control, it is time to take stock of recent successful experiences in the use of living organisms to prevent or minimise damage caused by insect pests.

30|$|However, {{changes in}} root exudates {{might not be}} the only {{explanation}} for the observed antagonism. In the greenhouse experiment, we observed that the inoculation order of P. arrhenomanes and M. graminicola did not influence the level of antagonism. It was remarkable that, compared with single nematode inoculated plants, significantly less <b>galls</b> and <b>nematodes</b> were found in plants infected with P. arrhenomanes, even if the P. arrhenomanes inoculation was done 6  days after nematode inoculation. Under optimal conditions M. graminicola infects within the first days, with visible galls at 3  days after infection. These data indicate that either the plant is not able to provide enough nutrients to the nematodes to maintain a feeding site or that P. arrhenomanes might be able to disintegrate the feeding sites. This hypothesis is supported by histological studies of Melendez and Powell (1967), who showed that Fusarium can colonize nematode-induced giant cells. Since Pythium spp. are known to colonize the vascular tissue (Van Buyten and Höfte 2013; Yadeta and J. Thomma 2013), a colonization of the nematode feeding site might explain the here-reported antagonism.|$|R
40|$|Plant-parasitic root-knot and cyst {{nematodes}} {{have acquired}} {{the ability to}} induce remarkable changes in host cells during the formation of feeding sites. Root-knot nematodes induce several multinucleate giant cells inside a <b>gall</b> whereas cyst <b>nematodes</b> provoke {{the formation of a}} multinucleate syncytium. Both strategies impinge on the deregulation of the cell cycle, involving a major role for endoreduplication. This review will first describe the current knowledge on the control of normal and aberrant cell cycles. Thereafter, we will focus on the role of both cell-cycle routes in the transformation process of root cells into large and highly differentiated feeding sites as induced by the phytoparasitic root-knot and cyst nematodes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} agronomic characteristics and responses to the coffee leaf rust fungus (Hemileia vastatrix Berk. et Br.) in coffee progenies resistant to the <b>gall</b> <b>nematode</b> Meloidogyne exigua. The experiment was conducted in December 2000 at Ouro Verde Farm (FazendaOuro Verde), located in the municipality of Campos Altos – Minas Gerais (MG). Ten F 3 : 4 progenies were evaluated. They were derived from crosses between CIFC 2570 Timor Hybrid selections and Catuaí cultivars known to be resistant to M. exigua. The Catuaí Vermelho IAC 99 cultivar served as a control. A randomized block design with three replicates was used. In total, there were thirty-three plots consisting of eight plants each. The following characteristics were assessed between the harvests of 2011 / 2012 and 2014 / 2015 : (a) yield expressed as processed coffee bags ha- 1; (b) rust incidence and severity; (c) vegetative vigor; (d) percentage of coffee fruits at the “cherry” stage; (e) percentage of floaters; (f) crown diameter; (g) percentage of coffee beans of size sieve 17 and higher; and (h) sensory analysis of the coffee beverage. The results indicated the following: (a) the H 514 - 7 - 14 - 2, H 514 - 7 - 4 - 5, H 493 - 1 - 2 - 2, H 514 - 7 - 16 - 3, H 514 - 7 - 8 - 11, H 518 - 2 - 10 - 1, and H 514 - 5 - 2 - 4 progenies were the most productive; (b) all progenies showed promising resistance to coffee leaf rust; (c) all genotypes had the potential for specialty coffee production; (d) the H 493 - 1 - 2 - 2 progeny showed resistance both to rust and the nematode, and has good potential for specialty coffee production; and (e) the yields of the H 514 - 7 - 8 - 11, H 518 - 2 - 10 - 1, H 514 - 5 - 2 - 4, H 514 - 7 - 16 - 3, H 514 - 7 - 14 - 2, H 514 - 7 - 4 - 5, and H 493 - 1 - 2 - 2 progenies were significantly higher than that of the Catuaí IAC 99 control...|$|R
