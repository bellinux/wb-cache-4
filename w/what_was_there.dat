The album took a year and one month to record, and features an [...] "eclectic sound" [...] in Sanz's words, containing elements of flamenco, R, and folk music. He worked with producer Sebastian Krys, who helped him [...] "enrich <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> but [...] the essence" [...] of the songs.|$|E

500|$|An {{experienced}} theatre and serial director, Roger Michell {{was chosen}} to direct Persuasion, in {{what was to be}} his first feature film. As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. [...] "I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper", he said. His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical. [...] He described the work as an [...] "erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning". While directing, Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen's story, seen for instance between [...] "the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm, wet feel of Uppercross". The Royal Navy was another point of interest, as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories. The director wished to depict the integration of cultures, as naval officers came back with [...] "an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> before".|$|E
2500|$|But younger architects in the 1930s {{criticized the}} style {{and size of the}} {{buildings}} at Federal Triangle for being [...] "elitist, pretentious, and anachronistic". Architecture critic William Harlan Hale strongly criticized the Neoclassical style for being unimaginative and anti-democratic: [...] "New Deal indeed! <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> either aesthetic or intelligent in cloaking the offices of a modern democracy as the temple of a classic tyrant, the gallery of a Renaissance prince, or the palace of a French monarch? ...we have learned quite a lot about the principles of modern architecture, just as we have learned a lot about some other things; and today, after so short a time, it looks pretty much like a relic out of the dim past." [...] By the 1940s, some critics said the buildings were too reminiscent of Nazi and Soviet architecture.|$|E

They were in a rush and {{they were looking for}} the new [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] and not actually listening to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> It was too fresh for them and they didn't get the plot. So, in retrospect, it doesn't surprise me that the diversity and breadth of what we were doing was overlooked or under-appreciated at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Moulton's {{imagination}} was fostered {{during her}} childhood. Her parents {{clung to the}} strictest Calvinistic principles. Games, dances, romances, were forbidden; and, as playmates were few, the child lived {{in a world of}} fancy. [...] "I was lonely," [...] she said, [...] "and I sought companions. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to do but to create them?" [...] Indeed, before she was eight years old, her active mind was creating a world of its own in a little unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to call a Spanish drama, and with which she spent all summer, filling it with personages. The rigid Calvinism of the family had undoubtedly a very stimulating effect on the emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge of melancholy found in many of her pages. As a child, Moulton also exhibited a great vitality, especially when she was not burdened with the terrors of [...] "damnation". Running {{in the face of a}} great wind was one of her joys, and she realized the reverse of such emotion in listening to the sound of the wind through an outer keyhole, which seemed to her the calling of trumpets, the crying of lost souls.|$|E
