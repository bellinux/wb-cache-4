25|$|Many of {{the opponents}} of Darwin's theory were {{respected}} men of science: Owen {{was one of the}} most influential British biologists of his generation; Adam Sedgwick was a leading geologist; Wilberforce was a Fellow of the Royal Society (though at that time about half of the Fellows were well-placed amateurs). While Darwin himself <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentleman</b> scholar of independent financial means, key disciples like Huxley and Hooker were professionals, and they concentrated on the advance of scientific knowledge, and were determined not to be baulked by religious authority. Their kind of science was to grow and flourish, and ultimately to become autonomous from religious tradition.|$|E

[...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentleman,</b> he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore.

500|$|Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries {{called him}} [...] "the {{last of the}} great gentlemen of the cinema", while the {{director}} Michael Winner commented that [...] "no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that [...] "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentleman,</b> a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".|$|E

[...] A {{spokeswoman}} for the show said, [...] "There is no suggestion that Lewis is {{anything more than a}} companion escort for his clients." [...] A writer for the Metro described Lewis as [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "charismatic", and a reporter from the Daily Record wrote that he was [...] "Weatherfield's answer to American Gigolo." [...] The soap's official website lists [...] "ungallant behaviour" [...] as something Lewis dislikes. Havers believed Lewis would eventually display [...] "a real dark side", though he was unaware of what that could be. Lewis is first seen accompanying Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska) to a Christmas ball. He is introduced by Audrey Roberts; Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly stated that she was [...] "immediately bowled over by his charming ways." [...] Claudia informs Audrey that she booked Lewis through an agency and Audrey decides to hire Lewis to be her companion to another event. Lewis goes to the Rovers Return Inn and pretends not to know Audrey. He then proceeds to chat her up in front of her friends, causing them to wonder how she attracted him. Havers thought the scenes were funny and called the storyline between Lewis and Audrey [...] "fantastic". In March 2010, Lewis was seen advertising his escort service in society magazine, The Lady. A reporter for The Belfast Telegraph revealed the character's classified advert would be seen in the real life magazine in a crossover with the show. A spokeswoman for Coronation Street stated [...] "The Lady heard the magazine was going to feature in an episode, and they approached us with the idea of using the advert in the actual magazine."

On screen, Audrey's friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) notices the advert and books Lewis for a date.|$|E

2500|$|James Matheson joined Magniac & Co. {{from the}} firm Yrissari & Co where he was partner. After Francis Xavier de Yrissari's death, Matheson wound up the firm's affairs and closed shop. Yrissari, leaving no heir, had willed all his shares in the firm to Matheson. This created the perfect {{opportunity}} for Matheson to join in commerce with Jardine. Matheson proved a perfect partner for Jardine. James Matheson and his nephew, Alexander Matheson, joined the firm Magniac and Co. in 1827, but their association was officially advertised on 1 January 1828. Jardine {{was known as the}} planner, the tough negotiator and strategist of the firm and Matheson was known as the organization man, who handled the firm's correspondence, and other complex articles including legal affairs. Matheson was known to be behind many of the company's innovative practices. And both men were a study in contrasts, Jardine being tall, lean and trim while Matheson was short and slightly portly. Matheson had the advantage of coming from a family with social and economic means, while Jardine came from a much more humble background. Jardine was tough, serious, detail-oriented and reserved while Matheson was creative, outspoken and jovial. Jardine was known to work long hours and was extremely business-minded, while Matheson enjoyed the arts and was very eloquent. William C. Hunter wrote about Jardine, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentleman</b> of great strength of character and of unbounded generosity." [...] Hunter's description of Matheson was, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>gentleman</b> of great suavity of manner and the impersonation of benevolence." [...] But there were similarities in both men. Jardine and Matheson were second sons, possibly explaining their drive and character. Both men were hardworking, driven and single-minded in their pursuit of wealth.|$|E
