5|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1853 Markham needed paid employment, and in December 1853 secured a junior clerkship in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at a salary of £90 per annum (around £6,000 in 2008). He found the work tedious, but after six months was able to {{transfer}} to the forerunner of what became, in 1857, the India Office. Here, the work <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> and rewarding, with sufficient time to allow him to travel and pursue his geographical interests.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect. However, the two would-be qualified teams, league winner Rosenborg and cup winner Strømsgodset, were free to play a pre-season friendly, although {{it would not be}} regarded as an official match. Rosenborg has traditionally played its final pre-season game against Viking and stated that they intended to take up that tradition following the abandoning of Superfinalen.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept of a story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E

5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind <b>was</b> <b>interesting.</b> But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{buildings}} were locally listed in 1999, they have been under threat of demolition since 2005. With the relocation of the school to new premises in Crouch Hill Community Park, Islington Council prepared a Planning Brief in 2012 for the site's redevelopment. When asked to consider listing the building in 2005, English Heritage acknowledged that whilst {{the composition of the}} whole building <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> it had been compromised by alterations and suffered from poor insulation and ventilation.|$|E

25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to see {{how strong}} the {{influence}} of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media {{to the advantage of}} presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} early {{recordings}} which survive {{from before}} the famous sextetos were formed. Some of the theatre music <b>was</b> <b>interesting,</b> for example, the Teatro Alhambra had a group of which Adolfo Colombo was the leading personality. He was a singer and regular recording artist, though few of these recordings have survived. One that has been reissued by Harlequin reveals a funky number which is hard to categorize. Listed as a rumba, it is perhaps best described as a guaracha-son. The artists singing are Colombo and Claudio García, the guitar probably Alberto Villalón, plus an unknown tres player. All three named players were white, yet the number is creole, almost Afro-Cuban, in style.|$|E
25|$|While the H11 {{was popular}} with hard-core hobbyists, Heath {{engineers}} realized that DEC's PDP microprocessors {{would not be}} able to get Heath up the road to more powerful systems. Heath/Zenith then designed a dual Intel 8085/8088 based system dubbed the H100 (or Z-100, in preassembled form, sold by ZDS). The machine featured very advanced (for the day) bit mapped video that allowed up to 640 x 512 pixels of 8 color graphics. The H100 <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> in that it could run either the CP/M operating system, or their OEM version of MS-DOS named Z-DOS, which were the two leading business PC operating systems at the time. Although the machine had to be rebooted to change modes, they could read each other's disks.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that <b>was</b> <b>interesting.</b>|$|E

25|$|Barys {{was founded}} on 26 November 1999 {{as the result of}} {{resolution}} accepted by the City Council of Astana. The team was gathered in a semi-professional level by an enthusiast players who were annually playing an amateur tournament for the prize of Mayor of Astana and professional players who came from other teams of the Championship. The team's name, Barys, is derived from the national symbol of Kazakhstan, translated as snow leopard. Nikolai Myshagin became the first head coach in the club's history. Under Myshagin rule, Barys earned silver medals in its first three season of play in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship. Barys would stay there until 2009. During the 2003–04 season, Barys squaded by junior players to serve as a base club for the Kazakhstan national junior ice hockey team. In 2004, Barys was admitted into the Russian ice hockey system. They made their debut in the Pervaya Liga; in parallel, Barys kept a second team in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship. Barys' debut in Russia <b>was</b> <b>interesting,</b> with the team doing fairly well. They played three seasons in the Pervaya Liga, where they finished respectively 3rd, 2nd and 1st of the Ural-Western Siberia Zone where they played. With this first place in 2007, Barys was allowed into the Vysshaya Liga.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 Hackett {{was elected}} to the Legislative Council as {{representative}} of the south-western province, and held this seat until his death. He was a delegate to the 1891 and 1897 Federal conventions, and was appointed a member of the constitutional committee. He was asked to join more than one ministry, but had to decline as it was impossible for him to add to the work he was already doing. He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would {{no longer be able to}} speak with the same freedom if he were in office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the pipe line to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG.|$|E
