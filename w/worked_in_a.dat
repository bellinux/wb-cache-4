30|$|I cannot {{respond in}} depth {{to all of}} the doubts, but I would like to respond to one in particular. According to Engbersen, {{multiculturalism}} does not <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era of liquid mobility, where more and more residents are temporary or “floating populations”, with variable and precarious legal statuses. Multiculturalism, he suggests, might have <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era when there was a finite number of immigrant groups all of whom settled permanently, but cannot <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> era of transient flows coming and going in all directions.|$|R
