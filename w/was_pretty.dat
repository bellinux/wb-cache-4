5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|Kidd {{was both}} {{director}} and choreographer for the musical comedy film Merry Andrew (1958), starring Danny Kaye. By the then {{the era of}} movie musicals <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much over, and Kidd {{turned his attention to}} Broadway, where he had continued to work while choreographing movies. At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can. In that show he created dance numbers for Gwen Verdon which helped make her a Broadway sensation.|$|E

5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that all major fortresses along the seacoast were {{occupied}} by the Romans, their rule <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> loose. In 69 AD, the people of Pontus and Colchis under Anicetus staged a major uprising against the Romans which ended unsuccessfully.|$|E
25|$|In 1048 {{conflicts}} between Seljuqs and Byzantines (Greeks {{were part of}} the Byzantine Empire and the Empire <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much Hellenized) started.

25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much the same.|$|E
25|$|Vice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan of Eastern Naval Command had {{maintained}} that it <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> clear that Pakistan would have deployed Ghazi in the Bay of Bengal {{and a part}} of its plan was an attempt to sink the Indian aircraft carrier Vikrant. At the same time concerted action was taken to disseminate misinformation designed to mislead the enemy about the true location of the aircraft carrier, and to foster confidence that the carrier was stationed at Visakhapatnam.|$|E
25|$|After 1931, however, Foster <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much lost {{to county}} cricket, playing a single match for Warwickshire {{in each of}} the next three seasons, and then not at all. In 1932, his one game was the fixture against Kent, and he took five for 81 and six for 82 to achieve a 10-wicket-match for the only time in his career. That same season he also played for a third time in the Gentlemen v Players fixture at The Oval, a batsmen's feast with 1074 runs scored for the loss of only 18 wickets.|$|E

25|$|Upon the album's release, it was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from music critics. Critics commended the album's production and praised the mixture of musical genres alongside Koda's vocals. However, {{the length of the}} material, Koda's songwriting, and the amount of musical genres were questioned by music critics. Commercially, Japonesque <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> successful. It became Koda's sixth studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 100,000 units. The album charted on Korea's Gaon Album Chart and Taiwan's G-Music Albums Chart.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal {{procedure}} were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.|$|E
25|$|From 1902 to 1908, Odell <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much an ever-present in the Leicestershire {{side and}} the leading wicket-taker in several of those seasons, though he also {{appeared}} for other amateur teams, including London County and five times for Gentlemen in the series of matches between amateurs and professionals. In 1902, he took 89 wickets in games {{at an average of}} 26.41. They included seven Hampshire wickets for 33 runs, which remained his best bowling figures for four years. In his first ever match for London County in 1902, he took six second innings wickets against MCC, including Arthur Conan Doyle for a duck.|$|E

25|$|Morton: Oh, I'll sing {{you some}} scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found it <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good for an introduction of a song.|$|E
25|$|Prince Charles saw her for {{the first}} time in Eutin in 1770 and remarked that she <b>was</b> <b>pretty.</b> The {{marriage}} was suggested in 1772, and the first ceremony took place in Wismar 21 June 1774: she arrived in Sweden 3 June. She entered Stockholm by gondola 7 June, and the wedding ceremony took place the same night, followed by a masquerade ball in Kungsträdgården. She was noted for her beauty — her waist measured a mere 48cm (19") and her shoe size 31 (girls' size 13) — and, as the marriage of the monarch had not been consummated after nine years, there were hopes that she would provide an heir for the throne.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, he was penalised five grid {{places for}} failing to slow down for yellow flags after Sébastien Buemi crashed, {{scattering}} debris onto the track. The R29's pace was again disappointing, when he could only manage to climb up to 10th from 16th place on the grid, despite a late safety car period after Jaime Alguersuari crashed heavily. Alonso said that his race <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much decided in qualifying, although he admitted that his car seemed to be fairly competitive. In Brazil however, he retired on the first lap when Adrian Sutil and Jarno Trulli collided, and Alonso was unable to avoid the out-of-control Force India, which had spun onto the wet grass, terminally damaging a sidepod on Alonso's car, forcing him to retire.|$|E
