40|$|Abstract: Shared <b>Workspaces</b> {{are getting}} more and more popular in helping people collaborate. However, it’s {{difficult}} for user to search information across different Shared <b>Workspaces</b> since they are currently islands that are not interlinked. Based on semantic web technologies, SIOC provide ontology and tools to interlink online communities. By using SIOC to develop an explorer for Shared <b>Workspaces,</b> we make distributed and heterogeneous shared <b>workspaces</b> interlinked and allow user to perform advance search functions across them...|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between the stable <b>workspaces</b> of the equivalent mechanisms of two adjacent step forward stages {{is determined by the}} robot movement. If there are no any intersections between these <b>workspaces,</b> the robot must walk unstably, or be running or jumping four feet off the ground. Instead, if some intersections exist between the two <b>workspaces,</b> a switching stage will occur in one gait cycle. In the trotting gait of the quadruped robot, switching stages exist. The stable <b>workspaces</b> of the equivalent mechanisms of two adjacent step forward stages must intersect together. Based on this principle, we can obtain the feasible stride length of the trotting gait under certain constraints.|$|R
30|$|Although the UP-equivalent PMs output 2 R 1 T motion, their {{reachable}} <b>workspaces</b> {{are usually}} of concern {{since they are}} used for locating in most applications. However, {{it should be noted}} that their reachable <b>workspaces</b> are highly dependent on their rotational capabilities since the position variations of the moving platforms in two directions are generated by the two rotational motions of the mechanisms. The reachable <b>workspaces</b> of the Tricept and TriVariant robots are not large because their rotational capabilities are limited to some extent by spherical joints, particularly with the existence of multiple spherical joints. It is meaningful to expand the rotational capabilities of UP-equivalent PMs to ultimately achieve considerable reachable <b>workspaces.</b>|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album {{containing}} musical tracks {{from the}} game, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and produced by Uematsu and Minoru Akao.

The soundtrack spans 85 tracks over four discs {{and has a}} combined duration of 4:39:53.

5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff <b>workspace</b> and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E

Groove {{can also be used}} in managing <b>workspace</b> sessions, including access control of the <b>workspace.</b> To collaborate on one or more documents, a <b>Workspace</b> must be created, and then those who are to work on it must be invited. Any file shared on the <b>workspace</b> are automatically shared among all participants. The application also provides real-time messaging, including one-to-one as well as group messaging, and presence features, as well as monitoring <b>workspace</b> activities with alerts, which are raised when pre-defined set of activities are detected. Groove also provides features for conflict resolution for conflicting edits. Schedules for a collaboration can also be decided by using a built-in shared calendar, which {{can also be used to}} keep track of the progress of a project.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this thesis}} simple models of two- and threedimensional {{continuous}} robotic manipulators are presented. As {{a first step}} towards the control of such manipulators characterizations of their <b>workspaces</b> are determined. In order to describe the boundary of the <b>workspaces</b> we apply optimal control techniques. In the twodimensional case the equations investigated {{are the same as}} the equations of motion in Dubins' problem. First, the known results of Dubins' problem are extended by the solution of Dubins' problem for free terminal direction. Then these facts are applied in the solution of the optimal control problem connected to the determination of the <b>workspaces.</b> The <b>workspaces</b> for free and prescribed terminal orientation are presented for various upper bounds of the absolute value of the curvature. The threedimensional case is much more complicated since it affords at least two control inputs and more knowledge on differential geometry as well. Unfortunately, the optimal control problem cannot be completely solved. Nevertheless, many facts are given and under further assumptions the <b>workspaces</b> can be presented...|$|R
