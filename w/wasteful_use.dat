25|$|By construction, {{each point}} on the curve shows {{productive}} efficiency in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point inside the curve (as at A), is feasible but represents production inefficiency (<b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of inputs), in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a {{point on the}} curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organization {{of a country that}} discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} a series of {{environmental}} laws and regulations passed in the 1970s, authentic environmental protection in the Soviet Union did not become a major concern until General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in March 1985. Without an established regulatory agency and an environmental protection infrastructure, enforcement of existing laws was largely ignored. Only occasional and isolated references appeared on such issues as air and water pollution, soil erosion, and <b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of natural resources in the 1970s. There were various reasons for not implementing environmental safeguards. In cases where land and industry were state owned and managed, when air and water were polluted, the state was most often the agent of this pollution. Second, and this was true especially under Joseph Stalin's leadership, the resource base of the country was viewed as limitless and free. Third, in the Cold War rush to modernize and to develop heavy industry, concern for damage to the environment and related damage to the health of Soviet citizens would have been viewed as detrimental to progress. Fourth, advanced means of pollution control and environmental protection can be an expensive, high-technology industry, and even in the mid-1980s many of the Soviet Union's systems to control harmful emissions were inoperable or of foreign manufacture.|$|E

Stevenson also opposed the burning of large sections of forest by the territory's Indian population along with other <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses</b> of natural resources. The new governor also lobbied for increases to the federally imposed limits to the territorial government's budget.|$|R
50|$|President Roosevelt was the nation's {{foremost}} conservationist, {{putting the}} issue {{high on the}} national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses</b> of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, Gifford Pinchot. Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and {{is considered to be}} the nation's first conservation President.|$|R
500|$|Years later, in 70 BC, the censors Gellius and Lentulus {{expelled}} Hybrida {{from the}} Senate for the criminal offences committed by him while in Greece, for disobeying the summons of a praetor {{and for the}} <b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of his property. Hybrida is described by the English Historian Antony Kamm as [...] "a thoroughly disreputable character" [...] and by author Dunstan as [...] "thuggish". In spite of this notorious reputation, Hybrida regained his seat in 68 or 66 BC after being elected as praetor. Hybrida also probably served as a tribune sometime before his expulsion from the Senate and also served as aedile from 69 to 66 BC. For the consular elections of 64 BC, Hybrida and another candidate, Catiline, received the support of Caesar and Marcus Licinius Crassus for their bids to become consuls of Rome. Dunstan describes Catiline as an [...] "opportunist" [...] who had gained notoriety for murders during Sulla's proscriptions, Kamm expands on this description by including the alleged murder of his own son, violation of a Vestal Virgin and many other [...] "unspeakable profligacies". A third candidate also existed for the consular elections, Marcus Tullius Cicero, whom Dunstan describes as being a [...] "brilliant orator", but he came from an undistinguished family. In the end, Cicero and Hybrida were elected {{to the position of}} consul for the year 63 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{a person}} can apply to the High Court for a {{prerogative}} order such as a mandatory order, {{he or she must}} be granted leave to do so by the Court. The requirement for leave is a preliminary step that helps to sieve out [...] "groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage" [...] and [...] "prevent a <b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment". Leave will be granted if the Court is satisfied of the following: ...|$|E

The defense argued that these men would never have contrived this plot without the leadership of paid informants, which many have considered a <b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of government resources, i.e., to create terrorism plots where there wouldn't have been any to begin with. None {{of the men had}} the money, knowledge or skills to obtain materials or assemble a bomb.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{situation}} in which interest groups compete in an all-pay auction for a political prize. The government, that allocates the prize, may deduce information about which interest group attaches the highest value to it. However, competition for the prize is also socially <b>wasteful.</b> <b>Using</b> mechanisms design techniques, we show that the government optimally trade-o¤s the costs and the bene 8 ̆ 5 ts of lobbying by completely ignoring all lobbying activities, and by always assigning the prize to the interest group with the highest ex ante value for it...|$|R

In particular the price of cane is determined by a formula which has been used virtually unchanged for about 70 years. Under this formula, the returns to millers {{are tied to the}} price of sugar, not the costs of milling. It is argued in the paper that this could lead to economically unjustified changes in milling arrangements and <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses</b> of milling resources. Other weaknesses of the present formula are also identified. An alternative formula, overcoming all identified problems, is suggested. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
5000|$|Water {{utilities}} (and {{other media}} sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses.</b> Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas. Las Vegas, Nevada, California Water Service company in California, and City of San Diego, California. The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water <b>use</b> restrictions on <b>wasteful</b> {{practices such as}} leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available. Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia. Temporary water use bans (also known as [...] "hosepipe bans") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|R
6000|$|Let {{the reader}} take a pen {{in hand and}} sit down and write, [...] "My very dear wife." [...] Clean, cold, and correct this is, {{speaking}} of orderly affection, settled and stereotyped long ago. In such letters is butcher's meat also [...] "very dear." [...] Try now, [...] "Migh verrie deare Wyfe." [...] Is it not immediately infinitely more soft and tender? Is there not something exquisitely pleasant in lingering over those redundant letters, leaving each word, as it were, with a reluctant caress? Such spelling is a soft, domestic, lovingly <b>wasteful</b> <b>use</b> of material. Or, again, {{if you have no}} wife, or object to an old-fashioned conjugal tenderness, try [...] "Mye owne sweete dearrest Marrie." [...] There is the tremble of a tenderness no mere arrangement of trim everyday letters can express in those double r's. [...] "Sweete" [...] my ladie must be; sweet! why pump-water and inferior champagne, spirits of nitrous ether and pancreatic juice are [...] "sweet." [...] For my own part I always spell so, with lots of f's and g's and such like tailey, twirley, loopey things, when my heart is in the tender vein. And I hold that a man who will not do so, now he has been shown how to do it, is, in plain English, neither more nor less than a prig. The advantages of a varied spelling of names are very great. Industrious, rather than intelligent, people have given not a little time, and such minds as they have, to the discussion of the right spelling of our great poet's name. But he himself never dreamt of tying himself down to one presentation of himself, and was--we have his hand for it--Shakespeare, Shakspear, Shakespear, Shakspeare, and so forth, as the mood might be. It would be almost as reasonable to debate whether Shakespeare smiled or frowned. My dear friend Simmongues is the same. He is [...] "Sims," [...] a mere slash of the pen, to those he scorns, Simmonds or Simmongs to his familiars, and Simmons, A.T. Simmons, Esq., to all Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Geomodelling is {{commonly}} used for managing natural resources, identifying natural hazards, and quantifying geological processes, with main applications to oil and gas fields, groundwater aquifers and ore deposits. [...] For example, in {{the oil and gas}} industry, realistic geologic models are required as input to reservoir simulator programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various hydrocarbon recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and <b>wasteful.</b> <b>Using</b> geological models and reservoir simulation allows reservoir engineers to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.|$|R
40|$|One {{option for}} coping with <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses</b> of fresh water in {{landscape}} irrigation {{is to use the}} treated greywater(GW). In the present study, an evaluation of a simple treatment system for reusing GW to irrigate green areas,trees, and ornamentals all over the campus in Tafila Technical University (TTU), Jordan, is presented. After 12 months of using the treatment system, the necessity for using fresh water as irrigation source was reduced. Meanwhile, the area of tree covered land increased from 2. 3 ha to 8. 4 ha and a 0. 5 ha grass areas were introduced in the campus area. In conclusion, the use of a GW as alternative irrigation source is considered an effective method for saving fresh water and increasing green area at the campus...|$|R

50|$|The Mohists polemicized against {{elaborate}} funeral {{ceremonies and}} other wasteful rituals, {{and called for}} austerity in life and in governance, but did not deem spiritual sacrifices <b>wasteful.</b> <b>Using</b> historical records, Mohists argued that the spirits of innocent men wrongfully murdered had appeared before to enact their vengeance. Spirits had also been recorded to have appeared to carry out other acts of justice. Mohists believed in heaven as a divine force (天 Tian), the celestial bureaucracy and spirits which knew about the immoral acts of man and punished them, encouraging moral righteousness, and were wary {{of some of the}} more atheistic thinkers of the time, such as Han Fei. Due to the vague nature of the records, {{there is a possibility that}} the Mohist scribes themselves may not have been clear about this subject.|$|R
40|$|Low-power {{operations}} can {{be great}} advantageous for ReRAM devices. However, wasteful overwriting such as the SET operation to low-resistance state (LRS) device and the RESET operation to high-resistance state (HRS) device causes not only an increase in power but also the degradation of the write cycles due to repeatedly rewriting. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a novel automatic avoidance circuit for dealing with <b>wasteful</b> overwriting that <b>uses</b> a sense amplifier and estimated the energy consumption reduction rate by conducting a circuit simulation. As a result, this circuit helped to reliably avoid the wasteful overwriting operation to reduce about 99 % and 97 % of <b>wasteful</b> energy <b>using</b> VSRC and CSRC, respectively...|$|R

25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses</b> of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|R
40|$|According to a {{frequently}} cited definition, economics {{is the study}} of “best use of scarce resources. ” The definition is incomplete. “Second best ” use of resources, and outright <b>wasteful</b> <b>uses,</b> have equal claim to attention. They are {{the other side of the}} coin. For our present purpose the phrase “best use of scarce resources ” will suffice. However, each of the two nouns and two adjectives in this phrase needs further definition. These definitions in turn need to be varied and adjusted to fit the specific circumstances in which the various kinds of optimizing economic decisions are to be taken. I will assume that the main interest of this gathering is in the range of applications of the idea of best use of scarce resources, and in the ways in which the main categories of applications differ from each other. I shall therefore describe mathematical ideas and techniques only to an extent helpful for the exploration of that range of applications.
