5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Aramaic <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the}} three largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan.
