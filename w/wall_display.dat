25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Republic, under the KMT's {{political}} tutelage, the flag shared the same prominence as the KMT party flag. A common <b>wall</b> <b>display</b> consisted of the KMT flag perched on the left and the ROC flag perched on the right, each tilted at an angle with a portrait of Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen displayed in the center. For the summits held between the KMT and Communist Party during the Chinese Civil War, the ROC flag was displayed at an equal position to the flag of the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet). Later, the flag law specified a horizontal display of the flag with the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in a portion of the red field at the center position. This display can be found in numerous government offices in Taiwan and is that which the President and Vice President face to take the oath of office.|$|E
500|$|In November 1980, {{the abbot}} Thích Giác Toàn along with Thích Giác Phúc {{organised}} an expansion {{that involved the}} erection of a two-storied compound that included the main ceremonial hall. The compound was built in an octagonal shape, as planned by the architect Nguyễn Hữu Thiện. The tower part of the compound is [...] tall, with octagonal sides of length [...] At {{the top of the}} temple are 13 miniature levels, which represent the 13 realms of existence. The tower was constructed from wood, with lotuses depicted on the exterior walls. There are 12 paintings that depict various events in the life of Gautama Buddha, including the birth at Lumbini, the enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, the first dharma talk at Deer Park in Varanasi and the entering of nirvana at Kushinagar. [...] Further parts of the <b>wall</b> <b>display</b> quotes from the Dhammapada written in Vietnamese. The entire artwork on and within the tower was the work of Thiện Ngộ and his group of artists from the Art School of Long An. The artwork was created between 1982 and 1984. The main lecture hall on the ground floor has wooden benches and can house several hundred people. A large statue of the patriarch Thich Minh Dang Quang stands {{at the front of the}} hall, in front of the wall paintings and a table on a platform where the speaking monk sit while giving a dharma talk.|$|E

40|$|Traditional text input modalities, namely keyboards, {{are often}} not {{appropriate}} for use when {{standing in front of}} very large <b>wall</b> <b>displays.</b> Direct interaction techniques, such as handwriting, are better, but are not well suited to situations where users are not in close physical proximity to the display. We discuss the potential of mid-air interaction techniques for text input on very large <b>wall</b> <b>displays,</b> and introduce two factors, distance-dependence and visibility-dependence, which are useful for segmenting the design space of mid-air techniques. We then describe three techniques that were designed with the goal of exploring the design space, and present a comparative evaluation of those techniques. Questions raised by the evaluation were investigated further in a second evaluation focusing on distance-dependence. The two factors of distance- and visibility-dependence can guide the design of future text input techniques, and our results suggest that distance-independent techniques may be best for use with very large <b>wall</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R

CubIT is installed at the Queensland University of Technology’s (QUT) Cube facility. The “Cube” is an interactive visualisation facility made up of five very large-scale interactive multi-panel <b>wall</b> <b>displays,</b> each consisting of up to twelve 55 -inch multi-touch screens (48 screens in total) and massive projected display screens situated above the display panels. The paper outlines the unique design challenges, features, use and evaluation of CubIT. The system was built to make the Cube facility accessible to QUT’s academic and student population. CubIT enables users to easily upload and share their own media content, and allows multiple users to simultaneously interact with the Cube’s <b>wall</b> <b>displays.</b> The features of CubIT are implemented via three user interfaces, a multi-touch interface working on the <b>wall</b> <b>displays,</b> a mobile phone and tablet application and a web-based content management system. The evaluation reveals issues around the public use and functional scope of the system...|$|R

Natural interaction with them, especially in collaborative environments, is increasingly important and yet remains an on-going challenge. Part {{of the problem}} is a resolution mismatch between low-resolution input devices and high-resolution <b>display</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition, enabling concurrent use by multiple users is difficult — for example, how would this large workspace be managed for multiple users and what novel collaborative interactions could occur?

40|$|Trauma resuscitation, {{the initial}} {{management}} of a critically injured patient, still mostly relies on paper-based documentation. The {{aim of the}} current thesis is to design computerized tools fitted {{to the needs of}} the trauma resuscitation setting. Previous research has found that computerized support in the form of shared <b>wall</b> <b>displays</b> could make the trauma resuscitation work practice less error-prone and more efficient. However, the question as to how the data required by such screens could be collected has been rather neglected. As such, the focus of the current work lies on the development of design hypotheses of a mobile data entry system for real-time data entry and corresponding shared <b>wall</b> <b>displays</b> supporting team cognition in the trauma resuscitation setting. Those design hypotheses have been developed by means of a case study conducted at the Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a fully digital data entry system to support real-time documentation of trauma resuscitations as well as the first work to present a synthesis of the existing research on the design of shared <b>wall</b> <b>displays</b> in the trauma resuscitation setting...|$|R
