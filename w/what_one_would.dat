It is said of Toyokuni's prints that they {{recreate}} exactly <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> see on stage; they show actors acting, not merely just pictures of actors. Together, these characteristics made Toyokuni's prints far more popular among theatre-goers than Sharaku's, although history has come to judge Sharaku the keener observer and greater artist.|$|E
25|$|In every control dialect, some syllables with {{different}} spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety {{will have a}} pronunciation for a syllable that is not <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect from other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.|$|E

25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as they please with her body, pushing the limits of <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E

25|$|In the Test arena, Taylor's {{performances}} were somewhat below <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect {{of a player}} at Test level. However, this was attributed to his young age and premature elevation to the national team. However, since Zimbabwe's return to the Test circuit, Taylor has shown remarkable maturity, both as the side's leading batsman and captain. He scored two Test centuries and when he scored a century in the fourth innings of the Test match against New Zealand, on a fifth day pitch, (inclusive of 5 huge sixes), he became the second Zimbabwean after Arnott to score a fourth-innings century in a Test match. Taylor has announced that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. He also scored two half-centuries, 71 against Bangladesh and 50 against New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
25|$|Falk et al. (2007) offered further {{evidence}} that the claims of a microcephalic H.sapiens were not credible. Virtual endocasts of an additional nine microcephalic brains and ten normal human brains were examined, and {{it was found that}} the floresiensis skulls are similar in shape to normal human brains, yet have unique features which are consistent with <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect in a new species. The frontal and temporal lobes of the floresiensis brain were found to be highly developed, in strong contrast to the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required for the members of H.floresiensis to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient, even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E

500|$|Pausch based {{the lecture}} on the generic [...] "Last Lecture" [...] given by some professors, and {{on the idea of}} imagining <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> say and <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> want their legacy to be if they could only have one last chance to share their {{knowledge}} with the world. Carnegie Mellon had previously had a lecture series titled the [...] "Last Lecture", but had renamed the series to [...] "Journeys", and had staff talk about their professional experiences. Pausch was offered the lecture around the time when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and had just received the news that he only had a few months left to live after his unsuccessful treatment for the tumors. Pausch nearly cancelled the lecture due to the terminal cancer, but discussed the issue with his wife and decided to take the one final chance to share his thoughts with the world. Pausch compared it to the final scene of The Natural, in which Roy Hobbs (the main character) overcomes injury and old age to hit one final home run.|$|E
500|$|Another great {{passion that}} is {{depicted}} in Traherne's work is his love {{of nature and the}} natural world, frequently displayed in a very Romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of [...] "literal setting", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{wrote that}} while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is {{evidence}} supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. Though they acknowledged that their study {{did not have the}} necessary data to explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, Bell et al. wrote that their findings were consistent with <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect to find if sexual preference had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors probably have a more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and {{that if there is a}} biological basis to homosexuality, it probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the [...] "familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality" [...] may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. Bell et al. argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more definitive answers about the origins of homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|Giotto {{provided}} {{the first evidence}} in support of Fred Whipple's [...] "dirty snowball" [...] hypothesis for comet construction; Whipple postulated that comets are icy objects warmed by the Sun as they approach the inner Solar System, causing ices on their surfaces to sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas), and jets of volatile material to burst outward, creating the coma. Giotto showed that this model was broadly correct, though with modifications. Halley's albedo, for instance, is about 4%, meaning that it reflects only 4% of the sunlight hitting it; about <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect for coal. Thus, despite appearing brilliant white to observers on Earth, Halley's Comet is in fact pitch black. The surface temperature of evaporating [...] "dirty ice" [...] ranges from 170 K (−103°C) at higher albedo to 220K (−53°C) at low albedo; Vega 1 found Halley's surface temperature to be in the range 300–400 K (30–130°C). This suggested that only 10% of Halley's surface was active, and that large portions of it were coated in a layer of dark dust that retained heat. Together, these observations suggested that Halley was in fact predominantly composed of non-volatile materials, and thus more closely resembled a [...] "snowy dirtball" [...] than a [...] "dirty snowball".|$|E
500|$|Aurora is {{a member}} of a trifecta known as the [...] "Golden Era" [...] of Disney heroines. Alongside her two {{predecessors}} Snow White and Cinderella, Aurora is one of the three original Disney princesses. Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles wrote that Aurora continued the [...] "trend of passive heroines who wait around for magic to change their lives," [...] a recurring theme shared by Disney princesses who were introduced both during and prior to the 1950s. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve dubbed Aurora [...] "the apex" [...] of [...] "women who made no choices for themselves". Writing for MTV, Lauren Vino felt that the character [...] "followed the basic princess tenants of loving animals and sleeping in makeup", while About.com's David Nusair wrote that Aurora followed the [...] "pattern of kind yet helpless princesses", similar to Snow White and Cinderella. Mary Grace Garis of Bustle observed that the original trio [...] "seek out marriage as both their endgame and salvation", elaborating, [...] "It's literally their own means of escape, and their only final objective." [...] However, Aurora's dreams and fantasies are different {{in the sense that they}} are drawn from loneliness and isolation; the character essentially longs [...] "for human connections beyond her three fairy surrogate mothers." [...] The Walt Disney Family Museum volunteer Lucas O. Seastrom agreed that Aurora is more [...] "self-confident" [...] and [...] "more of repose than the usual naiveté of Disney heroines." [...] Observing that Aurora's actions are influenced by the decisions and opinions of those around her, while most of the film's action involves Prince Phillip, Steinkellner joked that the character is so passive that she remains asleep during the film's climax. Dubbing her [...] "a girl of reaction," [...] nerdology.org's Lisa Kaye Cunningham felt that Aurora's [...] "little screen time makes [...] difficult to classify as a feminist, but her single active decision shows great promise in the evolution of feminist Disney princesses," [...] despite the fact that her agency is constantly undermined by other characters. Cunningham concluded, [...] "By making one active decision to try and follow her dreams, this princess made a big step forward as a stronger feminist than Snow White, though Aurora remains bogged down with passive reactivity." [...] Author Melissa G. Wilson observed in her book Mashups for Teens: From Sleeping Beauty to Beyonce that Aurora's reaction upon learning that she is a princess differs from <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect from a young woman.|$|E
