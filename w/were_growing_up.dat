Yuki takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains on good terms with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E

Largely an absentee father when the boys <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> Frank buries his feelings and rarely gives in to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that the senior Barone loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem comically criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra's defense following Marie's comments.|$|E

25|$|Charles' {{mother is}} Alix de Foresta (born 4 April 1926), {{daughter}} of Albéric, comte de Foresta. Although {{she was the}} only consort of the surviving Imperial line not born a princess, her family had been nobles in Lombardy since the 13th century, becoming counts palatine in 1330, constables of Venice in 1425, then retainers of the powerful Doria family in Genoa. They settled in Provence, France early in the 16th century, where they acquired twenty-two manors and the title of marquis by 1651. Ironically, the Forestas distinguished themselves during the French Restoration as courtiers loyal to the House of Bourbon, and to Henri, comte de Chambord in particular. Long established as squires of large estates and rice paddies in the Camargue, the Forestas often welcomed Charles and his siblings there while they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

He remembers {{that as a}} boy his mother insisted on his institutionalization, overruling his father's wish {{to keep him in}} the household. Charlie returns after many years to his family's Brooklyn home and finds that his mother now suffers from dementia. Although she recognizes him, she is mentally confused. Charlie's father, who had broken off contact with the family many years before, does not recognize him. Charlie is only able to reconnect with his now-friendly younger sister, Norma, who had hated him for his mental disability when they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> and is now caring for their mother in their newly depressed neighborhood. When Norma asks Charlie to stay with his family, he refuses but promises to send her money.|$|E
25|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{evidence for}} how housewives {{in a modern}} industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844-1938), who {{was held}} {{as a slave}} {{on a farm in}} Clayton County, North Georgia. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near Rex. He would have worked along with his slaves. Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about his father. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said the father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. After the Civil War, Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.|$|E
500|$|In 1811 {{the novelist}} Sir Walter Scott {{passed by the}} castle and later used it as the {{location}} for his novel Ivanhoe, published in 1819. Scott only had a partial view of the property from {{the road and the}} events portrayed in the novel, set {{at the end of the}} 12th century, are fictitious; Scott believed the castle to have been Saxon in origin, a view shared by many 19th-century commentators. Although the writer John Wainwright was still able to praise the [...] "picturesque view" [...] around the castle in 1826, the antiquarian Ecroyd Smith commented with concern in 1887 on the changing character of the location, in particular the factories that <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> around the new railway line and the [...] "murky atmosphere" [...] the industrial works created.|$|E

This is a monster, with just a crazy, weird face.'" [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere" [...] does not reveal Abadeer's name, with characters merely referring to him as [...] "Marceline's Dad". His full name would not be revealed until in the two-part fourth season episode. According to Moynihan, the name {{was inspired by the}} name that his brother had given their family's car when they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song.|$|E

500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} {{their creative}} intentions with The Revival, Tony! Toni! Toné! wanted {{to pay homage}} to their musical influences with Sons of Soul. In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired us when we <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, on May 9, 1989, with [...] "The Look of Love", from the 1987 film soundtrack Who's That Girl, on its B-side. When Madonna started work on Like a Prayer, she considered many options, {{and thought about the}} musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came to the realization that as she and her fans <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> and it was time for her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and indicative of what was fashionable, and ride the changing trend of music.|$|E

The episode {{was also the first}} to give a name to Marceline's father: Hunson Abadeer. According to Moynihan, the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family's car when they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song. To create the demonic effect of Marceline talking while possessed with the amulet, Olivia Olson and her father were required to say their lines in tandem. She later explained: [...] "We were going back-and-forth, line to line … We were screaming back and forth at each other, and trying to match pitches and stuff. Then, hearing the after product of both of our voices blended together was pretty fun." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said.

500|$|Katrina Kaif {{was born}} in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983. According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E
500|$|Few female {{respondents}} reported engaging in sex {{play with their}} siblings, {{and it seemed to}} have no {{role in the development of}} sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to report having enjoyed typical girls' activities, but more likely to report having enjoyed typical boys' activities, such as football, and to describe themselves as having been very masculine while they <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> These and other variables were combined into a [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity" [...] measure, which proved to be the second strongest predictor of homosexuality. Bell et al. noted, however, that childhood gender nonconformity did not seem to have been important in the way proposed by psychoanalytic theory, in that it was not a crucial link between family influences and their respondents' sense of womanhood, and nor was it explained by relationships within the family. Homosexual women were more likely to recall having felt different from other girls their age during grade school and high school years, and to say that they felt different because they were more masculine than other girls, more interested in sports, or not interested in boys. Homosexual women were also more likely to have felt sexually different. However, these feelings did not appear to play a role in the development of female homosexuality. Homosexual women, unlike heterosexual women, were sometimes labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, but such labeling also appeared to play no significant role in the development of female homosexuality.|$|E
