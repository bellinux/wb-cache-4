40|$|A {{new design}} for the anode of a time {{projection}} chamber, consisting of a charge-detecting "tile", is investigated for use in large scale liquid xenon detectors. The tile is produced by depositing 60 orthogonal metal charge-collecting strips, 3 mm wide, on a 10 × 10 fused-silica wafer. These charge tiles may be employed by large detectors, such as the proposed tonne-scale nEXO experiment to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Modular by design, an array of tiles can cover a sizable area. The width of each strip is small compared {{to the size of}} the tile, so a Frisch grid is not required. A grid-less, tiled anode design is beneficial for an experiment such as nEXO, where a <b>wire</b> <b>tensioning</b> support structure and Frisch grid might contribute radioactive backgrounds and would have to be designed to accommodate cycling to cryogenic temperatures. The segmented anode also reduces some degeneracies in signal reconstruction that arise in large-area crossed-wire time projection chambers. A prototype tile was tested in a cell containing liquid xenon. Very good agreement is achieved between the measured ionization spectrum of a ^ 207 Bi source and simulations that include the microphysics of recombination in xenon and a detailed modeling of the electrostatic field of the detector. An energy resolution σ/E= 5. 5 % is observed at 570 keV, comparable to the best intrinsic ionization-only resolution reported in literature for liquid xenon at 936 V/cm.

Hence the inertial loading of the wire can be reduced and the stability is also increased. 2. Multilayer sandwich vibration absorber: the axis of the reel is connected to a damped sandwich beam. When the perturbation occurs, the flexible motion of the beam can absorb the fluctuation of the wire.

40|$|Electric {{discharge}} machining {{has been established}} as an effective alternative process to conventional material removal processes for machining reinforced metal matrix composites. Wire cut electric {{discharge machining}} holes were produced in a metal matrix composite (10 vol% of SiC in Al 6061), which were then investigated to determine the machinability of the material using this process. It was observed that the input {{factors such as the}} size of reinforced particles, <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> and pulse-on time significantly affect diameter error, circularity and surface roughness. Pulse-on time, the interaction between pulse-on time and <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> contribute to the maximum diameter error. The <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> is the most significant factor to circularity, which is followed by the interaction between pulse-on time. In particular, <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> with low and high tensions results in poor circularity. It has been found that there are more surface defects encountered when particle sizes are smaller, and circularity is improved when particles are in a medium size. In addition, the surface defect is reduced as the particles increase the melting resistance of the surface. The higher pulse-on time leads to higher heat and more time to degrade the surface. Therefore, low pulse-on time and <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> gave better surface finish...|$|R

Effects of pulse-on-time on output variables at lower and higher <b>wire</b> <b>tensions</b> were investigated. Similarly, effects of the <b>wire</b> <b>tensions</b> on output variables at shorter and longer pulse-on-times were also investigated. Longer pule-on-time increases the MRR though the higher <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> reduces the MMR. The effect of <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> on MRR is much more significant at longer pule-on-time compare to that at shorter pule-on-time. There is an optimum pule-on-time for which best surface finish is achieved. The surface finish deteriorates when the pulse-on-time is higher or lower than the optimum pule-on-time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maintenance of wire {{pretension}} in an Ilizarov {{external fixator}} {{is dependent on}} the torque applied to the fixation bolts. We therefore measured immediately after surgery the clinically applied torques. The median value was only 10 N m (range 8 - 14 N m). We wondered whether this value is appropriate to maintain the wire pretension and thereby to achieve sufficient fracture stability during dynamic loading of the device for a longer period. METHODS: A material testing machine dynamically loaded one wire mounted on one ring. Several configurations were tested. RESULTS: A quick decrease in <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> to a steady state situation was seen. In the most stable configuration (20 N m wire fixation torque) 50 % of the initial 90 kg wire pretension remained after dynamic loading with 200 N. In the least stable configuration (10 N m torque) considerable wire slippage occurred even without loading and no tension remained after loading! No plastic deformation of the wires was observed so loss of <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> was due to slippage of the wires through the fixation bolts. INTERPRETATION: With the small fixation torques used in clinical practice considerable <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> is lost even after a few loading cycles. Further research should address the question whether preservation of a higher <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> during long term loading promotes faster fracture healing...|$|R

The <b>tension</b> in the <b>wire</b> was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the wire was clamped to the frame, the <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in <b>wire</b> <b>tension</b> was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that clamping the wire could be considered to squeeze the wire outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent.
