5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on <b>wig</b> powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered <b>wig</b> in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|The footage was {{captured}} on two Sony HVR-Z1 camcorders. Costumes had been purchased at an Oxfam charity shop in Dalston, East London, while a <b>wig</b> worn by Ashley {{in one scene}} was purchased from a Dalston <b>wig</b> store. Knowing that he would appear nude in several scenes, Ryder went to the gym regularly in the weeks proceeding filming to gain greater muscle tone. He decided to include footage {{from one of his}} pornographic videos in Uncle David, inspired to do so after learning that serial killers Fred and Rosemary West screened pornography throughout the day in their home.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wigs</b> {{have been}} used since antiquity as hairstyle and costume; ancient Egyptians wore <b>wigs</b> to shield their shaved heads from the sun. They also wore the <b>wigs</b> {{on top of their}} hair using beeswax and resin to keep the <b>wigs</b> in place. Other ancient cultures, {{including}} the Assyrians, Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans, also used <b>wigs</b> as an everyday fashion. There was intermittent use of <b>wigs</b> in many cultures throughout history including the prophylactic use of them in England in the 1600s to help protect from head lice.|$|R

50|$|During the 18th century, men's <b>wigs</b> became {{smaller and}} more formal with several professions {{adopting}} {{them as part of}} their official costumes. This tradition survives in a few legal systems. They are routinely worn in various countries of the Commonwealth. Until 1823, bishops of the Church of England and Church of Ireland wore ceremonial <b>wigs.</b> The <b>wigs</b> worn by barristers are in the style favoured in the late eighteenth century. Judges' <b>wigs,</b> in everyday use as court dress, are short like barristers' <b>wigs</b> (although in a slightly different style), but for ceremonial occasions judges and also senior barristers (QCs) wear full-bottomed <b>wigs.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Wigs</b> {{were worn}} for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed {{back from the}} {{forehead}} and clubbed (tied back {{at the nape of}} the neck) with a black ribbon. <b>Wigs</b> were generally now short, but long <b>wigs</b> continued to be popular with the older generation. <b>Wigs</b> were made with a lot of white powder.|$|R

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown <b>wig</b> and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown <b>wig</b> and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|Cast {{initially}} {{as young}} convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following {{his success in}} Thelma & Louise (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) {{when he went to}} audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a <b>wig</b> made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the <b>wig</b> in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.|$|E

50|$|In Britain, most Commonwealth nations, and the Republic of Ireland special <b>wigs</b> {{are also}} worn by barristers, judges, and certain {{parliamentary}} and municipal or civic officials {{as a symbol}} of the office. Hong Kong barristers and judges continue to wear <b>wigs</b> as part of court dress as an influence from their former jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Nations. In July 2007, judges in New South Wales, Australia voted to discontinue the wearing of <b>wigs</b> in the NSW Court of Appeal.

5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a <b>wig.</b> During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised <b>wig.</b> After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the <b>wig</b> after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E

40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to observe the histocompatibility and long-term results of <b>wigs</b> after xenogeneic hair transplantation and to explore the possibility of industrial products in clinical application. Methods. The human hair and melted medical polypropylene were preceded into the follicular unit-like <b>wigs</b> according to the natural follicular unit by extrusion molding. 12 New Zealand rabbits were used as experimental animals for <b>wigs</b> transplantation. The histocompatibility of polypropylene and human hair was observed by H&E staining and scanning electron microscope. The loss rate of <b>wigs</b> was calculated to evaluate the long-term result after transplantation. Results. Mild infiltration by inflammatory cells around the polypropylene and human hair were seen during the early period after transplantation, accompanied with local epithelial cell proliferation. The inflammatory cells were decreased after 30 days with increased collagen fibers around the polypropylene and human hair. The follicular unit-like <b>wigs</b> maintained a good histocompatibility in one year. The degradation of hair was not significant. The loss rate of <b>wigs</b> was 4. 1 ± 4. 0 % in one year. The appearance of hair was satisfactory. Conclusions. We successfully developed a follicular unit-like <b>wigs,</b> which were made of xenogeneic human hair with medical polypropylene, showing a good histocompatibility, a low loss rate, and satisfactory appearance in a year after transplantation. The follicular unit-like <b>wigs</b> may have prospective industrial products in clinical application...|$|R
5|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the cover}} included the group urinating against a Marshall Stack and an overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her genitalia. An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown <b>wig,</b> holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E
