500|$|A {{number of}} Round Tablers were inveterate {{practical}} jokers, constantly pulling pranks on one another. As {{time went on}} the jokes became ever more elaborate. Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself. They had several copies made, each slightly more askew than the last, and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott [...] "What on earth is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> portrait?" [...] until Woollcott was beside himself. Eventually they returned the original portrait.|$|E

To Eden, the magazine editors operate a machine that sends out seemingly endless rejection slips. When Eden works in a laundry, he works with machines but feels himself to be a cog in a larger machine. Eden's Blickensdorfer typewriter gradually becomes an extension of his body. When he finally achieves literary success, Eden sets up his friends with machinery of their own, and Lizzie tells him, [...] "Something's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> think-machine." ...|$|E

5000|$|Reviews of {{the album}} have been {{generally}} good, mentioning {{that there were a}} few tracks that could already be considered as classic James, e.g. 'Moving On', 'Frozen Britain'. The Daily Express called the album: [...] "a beautiful set of moving and inspiring songs" [...] and the reviewer goes as far as to affirm: [...] "It's one of my favourite albums of the year" [...] and that [...] "This record could be described as life affirming or as a great comeback album but I am happy to see James out playing recording and connecting with that ever faithful audience." [...] Renowned for Sound gave the album 3.5 out of 5 [...] and summarised the album as follows: [...] "La Petite Mort is a solid effort from the band... For the most part, the writing is focused, the production is polished and Booth’s vocals standout in a manner we are used to hearing. Sure there are a few misfires, but here’s nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> experimenting <b>your</b> sound. However saying that, only James do James best and after all these years, that classic James sound is what we want to hear." [...] The review by Gigslutz says: [...] "The album itself has a very theatrical swing to it" [...] and [...] "‘La Petite Mort’ may mean ‘The Little Death’, but this record has all the makings of a rebirth, signalling a refreshed sound from Booth and co.".|$|R

5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Tango, Klein {{stated that}} in America, children are raised to have negative feelings {{about sex and}} their sexuality.

[...] "When children in the United States grow up learning that their sexuality is bad, when every institution that children have contact with reminds them that their sexuality is bad or dirty or shameful or dangerous — when those kids {{grow up to be}} adults, they carry those lessons with them. And one of the things those kids decide when they are adults is that 'if there's something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> my sexuality, there must be something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> everyone else's sexuality. And, therefore, it's not only my sexuality that I need to repress, it's other people's sexuality that I need to be concerned about, too."
