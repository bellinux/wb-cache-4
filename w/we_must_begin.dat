Blaise Pascal outlined an approach to apologetics in his Pensées: [...] "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lead {{engineer}} and military air attaché, Oberst Heinrich Aschenbrenner, sent a stark warning that Soviet production was {{more sophisticated and}} advanced than first assumed. Hitler’s reaction was to speed up preparations; [...] "You see how far these people are already. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> immediately". Hermann Göring {{was told by the}} experts, from Daimler-Benz, Henschel and Mauser that one aero engine factory in the Moscow region was six times larger than six of Germany's largest factories put together. Göring was furious with the report, and dismissed it. He believed they had fallen for a Soviet bluff. Intelligence reports regarded as negative by the OKL were usually dismissed. In particular, Aschenbrenner listed some warnings that German intelligence had not picked up: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, Aero Club members {{including}} Charles Rolls, described {{accounts of}} the Wright Brothers' demonstrations of their aircraft at Le Mans in France. Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace [...] "This is the finish of ballooning: <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> building aeroplanes at once, and we can't do that without Horace!" [...] Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to join them, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. They soon started building two aeroplanes, for Charles Rolls and for Francis McClean, then they established an additional factory at Leysdown, Isle of Sheppey, later relocated to Eastchurch. In early 1909, Short Brothers {{signed an agreement with}} the Wright brothers to manufacture copies of Wright Flyers for sale under licence, and thus became the World's first aircraft manufacturer.|$|E

2500|$|In the Vedic religion, Ṛta (Sanskrit [...] "that {{which is}} properly/excellently joined; order, rule; truth") is the {{principle}} of natural order which regulates and coordinates {{the operation of the}} universe and everything within it. In the hymns of the Vedas, Ṛta is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders. Conceptually, it is closely allied to the injunctions and ordinances thought to uphold it, collectively referred to as Dharma, and the action of the individual in relation to those ordinances, referred to as Karma – two terms which eventually eclipsed Ṛta in importance as signifying natural, religious and moral order in later Hinduism. Sanskrit scholar Maurice Bloomfield referred to Ṛta as [...] "one of the most important religious conceptions of the Rig Veda", going on to note that, [...] "from {{the point of view of}} the history of religious ideas we may, in fact <b>we</b> <b>must,</b> <b>begin</b> the history of Hindu religion at least with the history of this conception".|$|E
2500|$|Trueheart {{was skeptical}} about its implementation, noting [...] "If we find Diệm {{in a mood}} to freeze up, rather than move forward, then I think his days are {{numbered}} and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> to make moves." [...] The troubles had become a public relations issue for Diem beyond his country, with speculation about a US-Diệm rift being discussed in American newspapers following the self-immolation. The New York Times ran a front page headline on 14 June, citing leaked government information that diplomats had privately attacked Diem's handling of the crisis. It also reported that General Paul Harkins, {{the head of the}} US advisory mission in South Vietnam to order his men not to assist ARVN units that were taking action against demonstrators. The US at the time considered telling Vice President Tho that they would support him replacing Diem as President. This occurred at the time as the surfacing of rumours that South Vietnamese air force Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai had begun gauging support among his colleagues for a coup.|$|E
6000|$|To begin these speculations in logical order <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> at {{the birth}} point, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> by asking how much may we hope, now or {{at a later}} time, to improve the supply of that raw {{material}} which is perpetually dumped upon our hands?

60|$|To trace out {{scientific}} {{evolution from}} its deepest roots would, of course, involve a complete {{analysis of the}} mind.

Both groups are wrong.
