40|$|Cold-trap {{regeneration}} may be {{very important}} in future LMFBRs because of the expected high hydrogen source from the steam generators. This hydrogen precipitates as NaH in the cold trap and may fill the trap within one year of operation. Several methods of cold-trap regeneration were considered, but the simplest and least expensive appears to be decomposition of NaH under vacuum at elevated temperatures. Experiments were done to assess the feasibility of this method for cold-trap regeneration. Small-scale simulated cold traps (SCT) were loaded with NaH and NaH plus Na 2 O, and were heated both under vacuum and under a sweep gas at 100 kPa. The evolved hydrogen was converted to water by a CuO bed and collected in a <b>weighing</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E

30|$|For pressure-flow experiments, upon harvest, pots were washed {{three times}} (3 ± 50 mL) to {{saturation}} with {{water for the}} control treatment and HgCl 2 solution (500 μM) for the inhibited treatment. Saturation of the pots allowed us to determine root conductivity since under non-limiting soil moisture, plant resistance exceeds soil resistance (in wet soil, the bulk soil potential is close to 0 MPa, Ruggiero et al. [1999]; [2003]). Following this washing, the above-ground part was cut off with a razor blade just below the cotyledonary leaves (40 – 50 mm from the base). Pots with whole root systems were placed in a stainless steel pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA, Maggio and Joly [1995]).

40|$|Objective: Compare the {{efficiency}} of three techniques for tongue cleaning, by comparison {{of the amount of}} tongue coating removed by each technique. Methods: Tongue cleaning was performed using an Oral B 30 (Procter&Gamble, São Paulo, Brasil) toothbrush; a Saude Bucal (Odomed, São Paulo, Brasil) tongue scraper, and a new tongue cleaning technique, consisting of a tongue cleaner with bristles and a scraping edge and a Halitus® (Halitus, Campinas, Brasil) tongue cleaning spray solution. The study design used 15 healthy volunteers who were submitted to each of the tongue cleaning techniques, once every 21 days. The volunteers were instructed to abstain from any procedure to clean their tongues, for 48 hours before the application of each technique. At each scheduled time, a dental professional performed a single standardized tongue cleaning procedure using one of the cleaning methods, and inserted the removed tongue coating into a test tube. Results: The results were obtained by <b>weighing</b> the <b>tube</b> test with tongue coating after the cleaning procedure (final weight) deducting the weight of the empty tube test (initial weight). The findings showed that the new tongue cleaning technique (combination of a tongue cleaner with brush and scraper plus a tongue cleaning spray solution) was statistically superior in removing tongue coating when compared with the tongue scraper or toothbrush, probably due to the technique and materials used. Conclusion: The tongue cleaning procedure, when performed within a specific technique, associated with products that improve the cleaning action, makes possible to reach better results, allowing the removal of more tongue coating...|$|R

30|$|The 18 F {{procedure}} {{involved the}} following steps. An 18 F sample was prepared in a 0.5 -mL volume within a 3 -mL plastic syringe. The activity {{was measured using}} a radionuclide calibrator (CRC 15 W, Capintec), and all subsequent measurements were decay-corrected back to this reference time. The calibration setting for 18 F (# 484) had been previously determined using an NIST-traceable 68 Ge/ 68 Ga mock syringe source that had been cross-calibrated for 18 F (X-Cal, RadQual, Weare, NH, USA). The radioactive sample was transferred from the syringe and mixed with approximately 30 mL of water in a closed container. Residual activity in the syringe was measured and subtracted from the original measurement to {{determine the amount of}} activity in the approximately 30 -mL solution. The exact volume of the radioactive solution was determined by weighing the container before and after filling using an accurate balance (XS 105, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and an assumption of 1 g/mL for the density of water. In this way, the activity concentration (Bq/mL) in a stock solution was accurately measured. Five 0.3 -mL samples were pipetted from this solution and transferred to five glass test tubes with stoppers. The exact volumes of the radioactive samples in each test tube were determined by <b>weighing</b> each <b>tube</b> before and after filling. From the volume of each sample and the activity concentration of the stock solution, the activity in each test tube was determined (approximately 5 kBq). The samples were each counted for 1 min using the 409 - to 613 -keV energy window with background, deadtime, and decay corrections applied. The efficiency of the gamma counter for 18 F was determined by dividing the gamma counter data (CPM/ 60) by the activities in the samples (Bq). The entire measurement procedure was repeated on three separate occasions.|$|R

60|$|The tubes were rectangular, {{with double}} {{top and bottom}} made of plates of wrought-iron, from three-eighths to three-quarters of an inch thick, and varying in length {{according}} to their position--the whole when put together forming a single tube about 500 yards long. The two centre ones were {{the largest and most}} difficult to manage, each having to be built on shore, floated off on barges, and lifted by hydraulic power a height of about 100 feet. Some idea of what this implied may be gathered from the following fact. Each <b>tube</b> <b>weighed</b> 1800 tons--the weight of a goodly-sized ocean steamer! A perfect army of men worked at the building of the tubes; cutting, punching, fitting, riveting, etcetera, and as the place became the temporary abode of so many artificers and labourers, with their wives and children, a village sprang up around them, with shops, a school, and a surgery. Two fire-engines and large tanks of water were kept in constant readiness in case of fire, and for many months rivet-making machines, punching machines, shearing machines, etcetera, were in full work. There were two million rivets used altogether, and the quantity of three-quarter-inch iron rod used in making them measured 126 miles. The total weight of iron used was nearly 12,000 tons. The bridge was strengthened by eighty-three miles of angle iron. For many months the outlay in wages alone was 6000 pounds a week, and the cost for the whole of the works more than 600,000 pounds. A curious fact connected with this enormous mass of iron is, that arrangements had to be made to permit of shrinkage and expansion. The tubes were placed on a series of rollers and iron balls, and it was afterwards found that in the hottest part of summer they were twelve inches longer than in winter--a difference which, if not provided for, would have caused the destruction of the towers by a constant and irresistible pull and thrust! The Menai Bridge was begun in 1846 and opened for traffic in March 1850.|$|R
40|$|SEVERAL {{elaborate}} {{procedures for}} the isolation of anaerobes from the gingival sulcus have been described. These {{include the use of}} oxygen-free gas to protect the specimen during sampling (Berg and Nord, 1973) and a portable, positive-pressure, low-oxygen box for the collection of samples (Sutter et al., 1972). These methods are often not considered feasible in dental hospitals and other clinical laboratories. Consequently a simple method was sought that would allow reliable isolation of anaerobic bacteria and that would be acceptable as a routine procedure in a dental hospital. Watt, Collee and Brown (1974) have shown that careful bench handling of specimens of faeces yielded anaerobes in numbers similar to those obtained by manipulation in an anaerobic cabinet. Rosenblatt, Fallon and Finegold (1973) and Starr (1974) have also found no advantage in the use of roll tubes over conventional bench methods. The techniques of Collee et al. (1972) and Watt, Hoare and Collee (1973) were adopted in this study. The amounts of material obtainable from the gingival SUICUS, particularly from healthy mouths, make quantitative estimations of bacteria difficult. Specimens weighed in air are subject to desiccation and prolonged exposure to oxygen, while samples held in gassed <b>tubes</b> <b>weigh</b> but a fraction of the weight of the container and consequently the error in weighing is great. Dispersal of the specimen presents further problems. It was therefore decided to study a number of different isolation procedures and to compare their relative merits as methods for isolating Bacteroides melaninogenicus from specimens. This species was considered to be a useful indicator because it is a fairly exacting anaerobe and its black colonies are readily recognisable on blood-containing media. Several selective and nonselective solid media, transport media and liquid media were compared in preliminary experiments on the quantitative and qualitative recovery of standard strains (Holbrook, 1976). In the present experiment several media and methods of isolation were studied in a clinical survey...|$|R
