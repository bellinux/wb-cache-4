5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 kilometer in diameter <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E
