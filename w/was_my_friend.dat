5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. [...] Ward later wrote, [...] "At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I have to thank for it.

5000|$|A simple copula {{predicate}} {{consists of}} sé am/is/are only. The negative marker pa and the TMA (tense-mood-aspect) markers can co-occur with the copula-type predicate, subject to certain rules (TMA markers: té past or anterior, kay prospective or irrealis, ka nonpunctual, sa abilitative). One such {{rule is that}} té + sé → sété (or just té without sé). The combinations permitted in an equative clause are limited in natural speech: a maximum number of two tense, mood, aspect and copula morphemes can co-occur in a given clause. Here are some examples of the equative clause type in Haitian Creole (predicates are in bold): (7) Ou sé jan mwen. You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou té jan mwen. You <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou kay jan mwen. You will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou pa té kay jan mwen. You wouldnt <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou sa jan mwen. You can <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Ou pa sa jan mwen. You cannot <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>friend.</b> Non mwen sé Tjals. <b>My</b> name <b>is</b> Charles. Tjals sété an Endyen. Charles was an Indian.Escure & Schwegler claim that sé is a copula verb. DeGraff [...] argues that sé in Haitian Creole is a resumptive pronominal that spells out the trace produced by subject-raising to Spec (CP) from within a small clause headed by the nominal predicate. The subject is first merged within the (extended) projection of the nominal predicate - i [...]e., in the subject position of the small clause - but it must move to Spec (CP) in order to check its Case and satisfy the Extended Projection Principle.|$|R
