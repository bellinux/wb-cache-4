5|$|Alpha, Beta, and Gamma {{were the}} first audio dramas based on Steins;Gate, and <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> as a trilogy of stories. They were {{published}} by 5pb. and distributed by Media Factory as three separate CD albums in 2010, on March 31, April 28, and June 2, respectively. They were {{also included in the}} 2016 box set The Sound of Steins;Gate Complete, along with other Steins;Gate dramas, music and light novel e-books.|$|E
5|$|Fate of Atlantis {{was praised}} by critics and {{received}} several awards for best adventure {{game of the}} year. It became a million-unit seller and {{is widely regarded as}} a classic of its genre today. Two concepts for a supposed sequel <b>were</b> <b>conceived,</b> but both projects were eventually canceled due to unforeseen problems during development. They were later reworked into two separate Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs and Elaine Lee, respectively.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist. He argued that if something can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist, then something greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived.</b> Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|R

5|$|In the 1997 novel The Genesis Code by John Case {{the leader}} of Umbra Domini, which is the author's version of Opus Dei, is portrayed as the novel's antagonist. In the novel, Umbra Domini members are sent {{on a mission to}} execute {{children}} who <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> using genetically engineered oocytes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|Early {{ideas for}} The Downward Spiral <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor {{developed}} a concept about the album's themes and later {{used it as}} lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral. This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
50|$|Anselm of Canterbury {{composed}} the ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is by definition the being than which no greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived,</b> and it <b>is</b> more perfect to exist than not to exist, that conceiving God not to exist <b>was</b> not <b>conceiving</b> God at all - it <b>was</b> <b>conceiving</b> a being less than perfect, which would not be God. Therefore, the argument proceeded, God could not <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{television}} series remake <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> {{to change the}} revivals names and story plot from the 1989 version which was directed by Laurice Guillen the plot <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> from the original storyline to present day times.|$|R

5|$|Highway89 was {{established}} in 1937 {{as a result of}} the rerouting of Highway9 between Orangeville and Highway27. In 1963, the route was extended west to Palmerston and east to Highway400. Plans <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> during the late 1970s to push the highway further east to Highway12 via Ravenshoe Road, resulting in a brief extension to Highway11. However, environmental protest over the chosen route through the Holland Marsh resulted in the cancellation of plans in 1986. In 1997, the section between Highway400 and Highway11 was decommissioned. The most recent change to the route took place in 2003, when the section of Highway89 between Palmerston and Harriston was renumbered as part of Highway23, creating a shared terminus at a junction with Highway9.|$|E
5|$|The First Commonwealth Paraplegic Games {{were held}} in Perth, Western Australia from 10 to 17 November 1962. These Games preceded the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games which {{were held in}} Perth from 22 November to 1 December of that year. The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> by Dr George Bedbrook after Perth {{won the right to}} host the Commonwealth Games. Great support was {{received}} from the Royal Perth Hospital, a leading spinal rehabilitation centre in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> to {{successfully}} {{bring an end to}} the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> at a later stage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, {{the decision was made to}} disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Olympic Games were {{complemented by}} the Youth Games, which give athletes {{between the ages}} of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> by IOC {{president}} Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC. The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14–26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later. These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.|$|E

5|$|The German {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of Poland <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> under the codename Fall Weiss (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, {{the west and the}} south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and rear gunner, escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack. At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, {{the second day of the}} German attack, Lent took off in the direction of Łódź and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a PZL P.11.|$|E
5|$|The first {{title to}} be {{conceived}} was Advent Children, original envisioned as a short film presentation created by Visual Works, the animation studio behind CGI cutscenes for the company's games. Early in pre-production, {{plans to make}} Advent Children a video game rather than a film were considered, but due to several factors including Visual Works' lack of experience with actual game production, it remained a film. One of the main conditions for the project's launch was to reunite the original staff members of Final Fantasy VII: Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, composer Nobuo Uematsu. After Advent Children began development, it was decided by the team that one title {{was not enough to}} fully explore the VII universe. In response, Before Crisis, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> so as to embrace more aspects of the world and characters. Nomura himself was surprised at the creation of the games, having originally assumed that the film would be the sole product of the project.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E

5000|$|Before 1516, Luther's {{belief that}} Mary is a mediatrix between God and {{humanity}} {{was driven by}} his fear of Jesus being the implacable judge of all people. [...] "The Virgin Mary remains in the middle between Christ and humankind. For in the very moment he <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> and lived, {{he was full of}} grace. All other human beings are without grace, both in the first and second conception. But the Virgin Mary, though without grace in the first conception, was full of grace in the second ... whereas other human beings <b>are</b> <b>conceived</b> in sin, in soul as well as in body, and Christ <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> without sin in soul as well as in body, the Virgin Mary <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> in body without grace but in soul full of grace." ...|$|R
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E
