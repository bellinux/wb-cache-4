25|$|At the 1960 U.S. Open, Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, {{finishing}} {{in second}} place two strokes behind Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked {{that he had just}} played 36 holes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.|$|E

And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|The episode explores Leonard's {{background}} {{and that he}} is [...] "essentially a deadbeat dad". In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Powell revealed that he was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic's review which referred to Leonard as [...] "basically [...] omnipotence" [...] as he is able to conjure any magic he wants, but is too lazy to take advantage of his powers. The review spurred an idea for an episode where Leonard would be responsible for dealing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid.</b> Powell called the episode's mythology [...] "very bizarre and surreal", but said that they tried to keep the core themes relatable, such as Leonard's relationship with his estranged son. The same day as the episode's original broadcast, a deleted scene from [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] was made available on the official Ugly Americans website.

500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} smile on your face and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones's {{performance}} as Edward R. Rooney in the 1986 film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, {{made him a}} cultural icon. Rooney, self-important and obsessed with catching the chronically truant Ferris Bueller, {{became a symbol of}} pomposity and authoritarian hatefulness. In a movie review, the New York Times characterized Jones' performance [...] "fine cartoon like ferocity", wherein his character [...] "gets scratched, bitten, attacked by ferocious dogs and covered with mud while pursuing his weaker, but craftier, prey, and emerges each time bruised but undaunted, thinking up some new (and futile) plan." [...] The review likened Jones' role as akin to that of Wile E. Coyote as a character who is fated to be unable to catch The Road Runner (Ferris Bueller). Jones expressed concern about being remembered more for this role than his Emperor Joseph II in 1984's Amadeus. He said of the movie's premise, [...] "What's amazing about Ferris Bueller, is that we're asked to, and do, sympathise <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> whose only complaint in life is that his sister got a car for her birthday and he got a computer." ...|$|E

The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "his isn't something funny or cute…ou're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "hat the hell is wrong <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy.|$|E

Then he takes out his pipe and his baccy-pouch and leaves one at one village, and one at the other, and off we two goes {{to see what was}} {{to be done in the}} next valley.

They were a poor lot, and we blooded ’em <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> before letting ’em into the new Kingdom. That was to impress the people, and then they settled down quiet, and Carnehan went back to Dravot who had got into another valley, all snow and ice and most mountainous. There was no people there and the Army got afraid, so Dravot shoots one of them, and goes on till he finds some people in a village, and the Army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot their little matchlocks; for they had matchlocks. We makes friends with the priest and I stays there alone with two of the Army, teaching the men how to drill, and a thundering big Chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging, because he heard there was a new god kicking about. Carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of them. Then he sends a message to the Chief that, unless he wished to be killed, he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind. The Chief comes alone first, and Carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about, same as Dravot used, and very much surprised that Chief was, and strokes my eyebrows. Then Carnehan goes alone to the Chief, and asks him in dumb show if he had an enemy he hated. ‘I have,’ says the Chief. So Carnehan weeds out the pick of his men, and sets the two of the Army to show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manœuvre about as well as Volunteers. So he marches with the Chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain, and the Chiefs men rushes into a village and takes it; we three Martinis firing into the brown of the enemy. So we took that village too, and I gives the Chief a rag from my coat and says, ‘Occupy till I come’: which was scriptural. By way of a reminder, when me and the Army was eighteen hundred yards away, I drops a bullet near him standing on the snow, and all the people falls flat on their faces. Then I sends a letter to Dravot, wherever he be by land or by sea.” ...|$|E
60|$|But in a while, as Samson visited His wife, in {{the wheat}} harvest <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> To her into her chamber he would go, The which {{her father would}} not let him do; But said, I thought that thou had'st quite forsook her, Wherefore I gave consent, and thy friend took her; Doth not her sister's beauty her's exceed, Though young? I pray then take her in her stead. And Samson said, I shall more blameless be Than they, though I shall do them injury. And then he caught three hundred foxes, and Turn'd tail to tail, and put a fiery brand Between two tails, and setting fire thereto, Into the {{standing}} corn he let them go, And burnt both shocks and standing corn and vines, And all the olives of the Philistines. Then they inquired who this thing had done, And were inform'd it was the Timnite's son; Because his father took his wife away, And gave her his companion to enjoy. And the Philistines came up, full of wrath, And burnt with fire, her and her father both. And Samson said, though you have done this thing, A further evil I will on you bring; And my avenging hand shall cease hereafter; And hip and thigh he smote them with great slaughter. And he return'd, and {{came up to the}} top Of Etam, and dwelt there upon the rock. Then the Philistines up to Judah went, And in the vale of Lehi pitched their tent. Then said the men of Judah, for what reason Are you come up against us at this season? And they made answer, We are come to bind Samson, to do to him in the same kind As he hath done to us. Then there went up Three thousand men of Judah to the top Of the rock Etam, and to Samson said, Dost thou not know that we have long obey'd The Philistines? Wherefore is it that thou Hast done this thing, to bring this evil now, Upon us, let us know it? Then said he I did to them as they have done to me. Then said they we are come, and have brought bands, To bind, and give thee up into their hands. And he made answer, you shall swear unto me, That you yourselves no injury will do me. And they reply'd, no no, we will but bind thee, We will not kill thee, but to them resign thee. And they took two new cords, and therewith tied him, And from the rock where he abode convey him: Whom when they to the camp at Lehi brought, The Philistines against him gave a shout: And mightily the Spirit of the Lord Came on him, and like burning flax each cord That was upon his arms became; the bands Were likewise separated from his hands. And he the jaw-bone of an ass espied, And took and smote them till a thousand died. Then said he, with an ass's jaw-bone I Have made mine enemies in heaps to lie. Behold I have destroy'd a thousand men With this same worthless ass's jaw. And when He made an end to speak, it came to pass He cast away the jaw-bone of the ass, And said, Now let the place where this was done Be by the name of Ramath-Lehi known. And he was sore athirst, and to the Lord He cried, and said, O Lord, thou did'st afford This great deliverance, and now shall I, By reason of my thirst fall down and die, And fall into the most accursed hands Of these uncircumcis'd Philistine bands? But God was pleas'd to cleave an hollow place, Within the jaw, from whence did water pass; Whereof when he had drunk, his spirit came As heretofore, and he reviv'd again: Wherefore that place, which is in Lehi, bore Unto this day the name of En-hakkore. And in the days the Philistines bore sway, Israel for twenty years did him obey.|$|E
