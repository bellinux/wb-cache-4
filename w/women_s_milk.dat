Methods: GERD was diagnosed by means of endoscopy and oesophageal pH monitoring.

40|$|Differences in {{clotting}} {{between human}} and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in the stomachs of infants are discussed. Gastric pH, after ingesting milk, {{of an infant}} up to 6 months of age stays at a pH range of 4 - 5, near the isoelectric point of casein, and never reaches the value of 2, which is found in adults. Pepsin C (or gastricsin) can hydrolyze proteins at this pH range. Gastric emptying time is shorter with human milk than with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> {{which appears to be}} correlated to the smaller size of human milk clots. Elimination of a readily coagulable fraction of casein from cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> by restricted rennet action produced B-casein rich milk with similar coagulating properties to that of human milk. Although pepsin digestibility at pH 2 was greater for bovine whole casein than bovine B-casein-rich fraction or human casein, this difference was minimized or even reversed at pH 4. This was ascribred to the difference in clotting behavior of s 1 -casein and B-casein, namely a harder clot of the former. Therefore, the difference in clotting and proteolytic properties between human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in an infant 2 ̆ 7 s stomach can be explained from the difference in chemical properties of their major caseins, i. e., B-caseins and s 1 -case-ins in human milk and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> respectively...|$|R

Objective: To determine the nutritional adequacy of two groups of 12 – 24 -month-old Irish children by type of milk consumption (consumers or non-consumers of GUM). Design: Using data from a cross-sectional study of Irish children, the National Pre-School Nutrition Survey (2010 – 2011), two groups of children were defined. The groups included children aged 12 – 24 months with an average daily total milk intake of at least 300 g and consuming GUM (≥ 100 g/day) together with cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> (n= 29) or cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> only (n= 56). Results: While average total daily energy intakes were similar in both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of protein, saturated fat, and vitamin B 12 were lower and intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fibre, iron, zinc, vitamins C and D were higher in consumers of GUM. These differences in nutrient intakes are largely attributable to the differences in composition between GUM and cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>milk.</b> For both consumers and non-consumers of GUM, intakes of carbohydrate and fat were generally in line with recommendations while intakes of protein, dietary fibre and most micronutrients were adequate.

The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing infant cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review.

Using reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction of milk cell RNA from a sample of platypus milk, we found no evidence for the expression of cathelicidins or defensins in the milk. This was unexpected. We hypothesise that these natural antibiotics may instead be produced by the young platypuses themselves. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how trade affects <b>women</b> <b>s</b> {{job opportunities}} and earnings through five case studies: Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> {{share of the}} labour force has increased over time and the wage gap {{between men and women}} has narrowed. A positive and statistically significant correlation between exports and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> share of employment is found while there is a statistically significant and negative correlation between <b>women</b> <b>s</b> share in employment and imports. The correlations stem from variation between sectors rather than within sectors over time, indicating that export-competing industries tend to employ women while import-competing industries tend to employ men. Trade liberalization is likely to create jobs for women and over time increase their relative wages. ...|$|R

In The Feminine Mystique Betty Friedan gave a name to the frustration white middle-class women living in suburbia with 3. 2 children felt. Women suddenly realized that they were not alone with their problems. Betty Friedan named the frustration that many career homemakers felt the problem that has no name, and urged them to break away from their domestic confines, go back to school, pursue careers, and revive the vision of female independence that had been alive before World War II. The Feminine Mystique lit a spark for the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation movement in the late 1960 s. The movement included the Old Left women in National Organization of Women (NOW), and the young women who created loosely affiliated small groups collectively known as the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation movement. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> rights entered the political agenda, with giving women the right to abortion in 1973 among the most important victories...|$|R

40|$|Our aim was {{to develop}} {{guidance}} for general paediatricians and primary care physicians in diagnosing and managing cow 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein allergy in infants. The guidelines were developed by discussion based on existing national recommendations and standards, clinical experience and, whenever possible, evidence from the literature.

Patients with severe symptoms need {{to be referred to}} a specialist. Elimination of cow 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> protein from the infant 9 ̆ 2 s or mother 9 ̆ 2 s diet and challenges are the gold standard for diagnosis.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the nature and extent}} of mentoring of women science and engineering (S 2 ̆ 6 E) doctoral students in American colleges and universities. Recent demographic shifts have diminished the proportion of young white males, traditionally the major recipients of S 2 ̆ 6 E degrees. This trend, coupled with a production plateau of <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctorates after a sharp rise in the 1970 s and 1980 s, signals a need for effective recruitment and retention strategies toward reigniting an upward trend for <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E production if the U. S. is to continue as a world leader in science and technology. ^ Many bodies of literature suggest mentoring may have promise in increasing <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctoral production. However, little research has been completed about faculty dynamics. This study attempted to ascertain: how faculty mentoring is performed; administrator perceptions of the most important mentoring elements; and the relationship of mentoring to <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctorate production. ^ The National Research Council rank-ordered U. S. doctorate granting institutions according to productivity indexes, i. e., the ratio of <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctorates to total S 2 ̆ 6 E doctorates awarded, for 1994 <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctorates. ^ Graduate school deans in U.

40|$|People talk {{of having}} an allergy to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> but such allergies are in fact quite rare. People are {{normally}} referring to an intolerance of cow <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> through the body s reaction to lactose, the natural sugar of milk. It is a double sugar {{that has to be}} divided into two separate sugars for the body {{to be able to use}} them. This division usually takes place in the small intestine, mediated by an enzyme known as lactase. After birth and during infancy, most people produce enough lactase to digest the <b>milk</b> <b>s</b> lactose. It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose. An alternative to cow <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> is soya milk, which is also a complementary foodstuff.
