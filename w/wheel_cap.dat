50|$|The {{second major}} crash in turn one {{in as many}} days {{occurred}} on Thursday. At 5:18 p.m., Josef Newgarden lost control in turn one, did a three-quarter spin, and hit the outside wall in the south short chute with the nose. The car flipped over, and slid to a rest upside-down {{near the entrance to}} turn two. Newgarden was uninjured, and the crash appeared vastly similar to Hélio Castroneves' a day earlier. The two accidents prompted officials to re-evaluate an optional Chevrolet aerokit rear <b>wheel</b> <b>cap</b> that had been installed on both cars.|$|E
50|$|Darvall {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} car {{accident}} on Main Road in Observatory, Cape Town. She and her family were visiting friends for afternoon tea and went shopping for cake. They were run over by a drunk driver who failed to see them. Her mother died immediately. Darvall sustained a skull fracture and severe head injuries, after the car flung her across the road and her head hit the <b>wheel</b> <b>cap</b> of her own car. She could not stay alive without life support, and was essentially brain dead. At 9 p.m. {{on the day of the}} accident, the resuscitation team stopped trying to revive her.|$|E

50|$|From {{meteorological}} data at {{the area where}} the contest is to take place, it can be concluded that there will likely be a strong side-wind. The <b>wheel</b> <b>caps</b> of the Nuna 3 are designed such that a sidewind will have a propulsory effect.|$|R
25|$|For the 1989 model year, and in {{part because}} of a {{government}} decree that required the company to cut the retail price and tax reduction, the Mexican Beetle was relaunched as the Volkswagen Sedan. This new model lost its <b>wheel</b> <b>caps,</b> the body vents it had sported since 1978, and the fittings were of lower quality.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the current}} {{windmill}} {{was built in}} 1803 as a gristmill, a wooden post mill was built in this location around 1400. In 1707, the wooden post mill was torn down and replaced with a stone mill. When this became too small, De Noord was built. In 1930, a diesel engine was added inside the windmill to keep production going {{when there was no}} wind. The engine is currently along the s' Gravelandseweg in Schiedam. From the 1930s and on, wind energy became less and less common, leading to the dismantling of De Noord in 1937. The beams, capstan <b>wheel,</b> <b>cap,</b> sail-cross and railings were all removed at that time.|$|E
50|$|The shell jacket became {{regulation}} for the US army in 1833, {{replacing the}} Napoleonic-era blue tailcoat. Infantry jackets were sky blue with white piping and silver buttons. Cavalry uniforms were navy blue with orange (later yellow) piping and artillery uniforms were identical but with red piping; they had brass rather than silver buttons. The infantry uniform was worn during the Mexican War until 1851 {{when it was}} replaced with the dark blue frock coat with sky blue piping. Trousers with a fly front replaced the older-style flap-front design and kepis and Hardee hats replaced the M1839 <b>Wheel</b> <b>Cap.</b> Cavalry and artillery shell jackets remained in use until after the American Civil War as they were more practical for mounted troops than the long frock (which was briefly introduced in 1851 but rejected).|$|E
5000|$|A 2008-2009 Bullitt edition {{has been}} {{released}} as well. Exterior features include uniquely finished 18" [...] Torq-Thrust style wheels and removal of the decklid spoiler and all badges except for the faux gas cap, which is replaced with a Bullitt-specific unit. Inside, there are Bullitt door sills, gauges, and steering <b>wheel</b> <b>cap,</b> an engine-turned aluminum dash panel, aluminum shift knob and pedals, and GT500-inspired front seats and GT500-inspired steering wheel with black stitching. The first factory Mustang open-element air filter, unique exhaust that mimics the sound of Steve McQueen's GT 390 Fastback and ends in 3.5-inch tips, and new engine programing raise horsepower to 315 (up from 300). A Tremec 5-speed manual and 3.73:1 ratio live rear axle drops 0-60 mph times to 4.9-5.0 seconds compared to the standard GT's 5.2-5.3, and quarter miles come in 13.8 seconds at 102 mi/h km/h. Suspension is upgraded by a Bullitt-badged front tower brace and retuned suspension components that drop the ride height by 6 mm. [...] The Bullitt package is a $3,310 upgrade from the standard GT Premium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the model}} 2002 {{one of the}} last limited editions was introduced, the Volkswagen Beetle Summer. This was {{characterized}} by two special colors: A new shade of yellow, and a new shade of blue original from the European Volkswagen Lupo. Its chrome <b>wheel</b> <b>caps</b> contrasted with its monochrome scheme. Like other editions, the Beetle Summer had rear and side Summer anagrams.|$|R

40|$|Landing gear noise {{prediction}} method is developed using Building-Cube Method (BCM). The BCM is a multiblock-structured Cartesian mesh flow solver, {{which aims to}} enable practical large-scale computation. The computational domain is composed of assemblage of various sizes of building blocks where small blocks are used to capture flow features in detail. Because of Cartesian-based mesh, easy and fast mesh generation for complicated geometries is achieved. The airframe noise is predicted through the coupling of incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver and the aeroacoustic analogy-based Curle’s equation. In this paper, Curle’s equation in noncompact form is introduced to predict the acoustic sound from an object in flow. This approach is applied to JAXA Landing gear Evaluation Geometry model to investigate {{the influence of the}} detail components to flows and aerodynamic noises. The position of torque link and the <b>wheel</b> <b>cap</b> geometry are changed to discuss the influence. The present method showed good agreement with the preceding experimental result and proved that difference of the complicated components to far field noise was estimated. The result also shows that the torque link position highly affects the flow acceleration at the axle region between two wheels, which causes the change in SPL at observation point...|$|E

5000|$|In the United States armed forces, [...] "scrambled eggs" [...] is the {{nickname}} {{for the golden}} oak leaf embellishments (known as fretting) on the bills of dress hats (called service <b>caps</b> or <b>wheel</b> <b>caps</b> in the Army and combination covers in the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) worn by field grade and general officers in the rank/grade of Major (O-4) or higher in the Army and Marine Corps, and senior and flag officers in the rank/grade of Commander (O-5) or higher in the Navy and Coast Guard. The equivalent embellishments on the service <b>caps</b> (<b>wheel</b> <b>caps)</b> of field grade and general officers in the rank/grade of Chief Warrant Officer Three-Chief Warrant Officer Five (W-3-W-5), and Major (O-4) or higher in the Air Force are silver clouds and darts (lightning bolts) in place of oak leaves, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "farts and darts." [...] The difference in grades when an officer assumes the wearing of embellishments is peculiar to the individual customs and traditions of each service, i.e., the Navy and Coast Guard consider the grade of O-4 to be a junior officer rank, while the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps consider it to be a field grade officer rank. At the flag or general officer level, O-7 and higher, additional embellishments are added to distinguish them from the USN/USCG senior officer and United States/USAF/USMC field grade officer ranks.|$|R
2500|$|The 1992 {{model was}} fitted with Brazilian steel wheels, with a {{slightly}} different design than the ones previously seen. These wheels are often, but not always, found in some vehicles produced between 1991 and 1995. On June 23 the Volkswagen Beetle reached 21 million units produced throughout the world.

50|$|Alloy {{wheels are}} also {{purchased}} for cosmetic purposes although the cheaper alloys used {{are usually not}} corrosion-resistant. Alloys allow the use of attractive bare-metal finishes, but these need to be sealed with paint or wheel covers. Even if so protected the wheels in use will eventually start to corrode after 3 to 5 years but refurbishment is now widely available at a cost. The manufacturing processes also allow intricate, bold designs. In contrast, steel wheels are usually pressed from sheet metal, and then welded together (often leaving unsightly bumps) and must be painted to avoid corrosion and/or hidden with <b>wheel</b> covers/hub <b>caps.</b>|$|R
