500|$|In 2011, Romm {{stated that}} [...] "Feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century {{in the face}} of a rapidly {{worsening}} climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced." [...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet {{no one seems to}} care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? <b>Will</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E

Members of the hip hop industry generally responded positively to the announcement. Tyler, The Creator also tweeted his support for Ocean, along {{with other members of}} OFWGKTA. Russell Simmons, a business magnate in the hip hop industry, wrote a congratulatory article in Global Grind saying [...] "Today is a big day for hip-hop.

6000|$|Having {{inherited}} his estate, {{all went}} well {{with me for}} years. The idea of detection never once entered my brain. Of {{the remains of the}} fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew by which {{it would be possible to}} convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, [...] "I am safe." ...|$|E

We also rejoiced to hear that they are in a degenerated condition, and that they have offended their Prince, and that he is gone.

It is to you, Por Sing, and you nobles of Oude, that we surrender, and not to those who, being sworn soldiers, have mutinied against their officers, and have in many cases treacherously murdered them. With such men Major Hannay will have no dealings, and it is to you that we surrender. Major Hannay bids me say that if this offer is refused, we can for a long time prolong our resistance. We are amply supplied with provisions and munitions of war, and many as are the numbers of our assailants who have fallen already, yet more will die before you obtain possession of the house. More than that, in no case <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> taken prisoners, for one and all have firmly resolved to fire the magazine when resistance is no longer possible, and to bury ourselves and our assailants in the ruins." ...|$|E

'We are the strong, all of us, and we are stronger than Dog-Tooth and Tiger- Face and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and all the rest who do nothing and eat much and weaken us by the hurt of their strength which is bad strength. Men who are slaves are not strong. If the man who first found the virtue and use of fire had used his strength we would have been his slaves, as we are the slaves to-day of Little-Belly, who found the virtue and use of the fish-trap; and of the men who found the virtue and use of the land, and the goats, and the fire- brew. Before, we lived in trees, my brothers, and no man was safe. But we fight no more with one another. We have added our strength together. Then let us fight no more with the Meat-Eaters. Let us add our strength and their strength together. Then <b>will</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> indeed strong. And then we will go out together, the Fish-Eaters and the Meat-Eaters, and we will kill the tigers and the lions and the wolves and the wild dogs, and we will pasture our goats on all the hill-sides and plant our corn and fat roots in all the high mountain valleys. In that day we will be so strong that all the wild animals will flee before us and perish. And nothing will withstand us, for the strength of each man will be the strength of all men in the world.' ...|$|E

But upon one thing we are determined: there shall be no plundering. Our cause is a just one, and for that we are ready to fight. But should any join us with the intention of turning this movement to their private advantage, and of plunder and robbery, we warn them that such will not be permitted, and any man caught plundering will at once be hung. They may call us rioters; they may try and persuade the king that we are disloyal subjects, though this is not the case. One thing they shall not say of us, that we are a band of robbers and thieves. By to-night we shall be joined by all true men of the neighbourhood, and will then march to Gravesend, where our fellows have already risen and are in arms; thence we go to Rochester and deliver those of our brethren who have been thrown into prison because they could not pay the unjust taxes. That done, we will go straight to London and demand from the king himself a charter granting the four points we demand. Wat the Tyler has been chosen our leader. He has struck the first blow, and as a man of courage and energy there is no fear of his betraying us, seeing that he has already put his head into a noose.
