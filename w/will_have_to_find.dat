500|$|The game {{uses the}} Havok physics engine, which the {{developers}} chose {{because it was}} [...] "hands-down the best solution to our needs". They found that a dedicated physics engine was vital to create Max's combat scenes, which Max Payne was known for, [...] "with increased realism and dramatic, movielike action". The physics engine made several situations seem more realistic. For example, when in combat, the player can take cover behind boxes; however, when enemy bullets impact the boxes, they will topple over, {{in which case the}} player <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> another suitable object to use for cover. When an enemy is hidden behind a wall divider, the player can throw a grenade next to it to send the cover flying through the air, rendering the enemy unprotected. The Havok engine was tweaked to make weapons, bombs, and Molotov cocktails act more naturally, and the audio was updated to make them sound more realistic. The new physics engine allowed for certain actions that could not happen in Max Payne; boxes can be moved and follow the laws of gravitation, and explosion detonations make enemy bodies fall realistically.|$|E

500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E
