50|$|Maintenance was {{performed}} on the engines by opening panels in {{the leading edge of the}} wing either side of the powerplant. A plank could be fitted across the front of the engine on the extensions of the open panels. A small manually started auxiliary petrol engine, which was fitted into the leading edge of the right wing, powered a bilge and a fuel pump for clearing water and other fluids from the fuselage bilges and for refuelling. Generally, the aircraft were reasonably water tight, and two people manually operating a <b>wobble</b> <b>pump</b> could transfer fuel faster than the auxiliary pump. In sheltered moorings or at sea, fuelling was accomplished by a powered or unpowered barge and with engine driven or hand powered pumps. At regular moorings, there would be specially designed refuelling barges to do the job, normally manned by trained marine crew. These vessels could refuel many aircraft during the course of the day. Handling of the fuel nozzles and opening/closing the aircraft fuel tanks would normally be an aircraftman's task.|$|E
40|$|A design {{philosophy}} for pumps in biotechnology is expounded using a {{circulating pump}} for bioreactors and ultrafiltration units {{as the model}} case. From {{an analysis of the}} biosystem the main task and 16 partial functions of the ideal pump have been derived. Wobble plates were found to represent the most suited principle to realize the delivery under the required mild and airtight conditions. An optimized <b>wobble</b> plate <b>pump</b> has been developed up to the detailed prototype design. Test results obtained with the prototype and with a persitaltic pump demonstrate the superiority of the <b>wobble</b> plate <b>pump</b> in the delivery of shearing stress-sensitive cells.

50|$|Axial piston pump: many {{designed}} with a variable displacement mechanism, to vary output flow for automatic control of pressure. There are various axial piston pump designs, including swashplate (sometimes {{referred to as}} a valveplate pump) and checkball (sometimes {{referred to as a}} <b>wobble</b> plate <b>pump).</b> The most common is the swashplate pump. A variable-angle swashplate causes the pistons to reciprocate a greater or lesser distance per rotation, allowing output flow rate and pressure to be varied (greater displacement angle causes higher flow rate, lower pressure, and vice versa).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} work described {{the effect of}} flow control valve type {{on the performance of}} wobble plate type fuel pump for the stable DME fuel supply. In order to study this, different four types of flow control valves (ITV, SCV, IMV and MPROP) were installed on the <b>wobble</b> plate fuel <b>pump,</b> and fuel flow rate, torque, and temperature variation of pump were investigated under various operating conditions by using pump performance test system. It was revealed that wobble plate type fuel pump worked well with ITV and SCV control valve, and the flow rate and torque of fuel pump was in proportion to the value of valve open duty. The maximum flow rate and torque of fuel pump were achieved around the 50 % duty of control valve. Temperature variation at all pump measuring points were under 60 ℃ which is acceptable.
