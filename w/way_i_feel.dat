500|$|Explaining {{his choice}} of label, Thornton said, [...] "I chose to go with {{somebody}} that [...] take this as a creative project, not a marketing project. Major labels tend to let inexperienced people oversee your projects. Your innovation goes down because they have [...] input. You don't see anybody going into the studio to tell James Brown what to do. Even though he can adapt to certain things, nobody tells him how to sing. That's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency".

5000|$|An {{interview}} {{reported by}} Jane Oddy in Mirror News (27 February 2014) quoted him saying [...] "I am happy and actually it’s fine. I don’t miss my faith. In many <b>ways</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> more settled and happier in myself without it. I don’t {{know if that}} is related to losing my faith or {{would have been the}} case anyway, but it’s a non-issue as far as I am concerned. Seven years on <b>I</b> don’t <b>feel</b> a gap in my life and I suppose that’s the proof of the pudding isn’t it? Had I suddenly thought that life doesn’t quite feel right, maybe I’d re-examine that - re-examine my faith. In fact, more than ever, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable with where I am in life.” ...|$|R
500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E
500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But I think at least the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2003 interview, Reynolds recalled: [...] "from {{an early}} age I always wanted a life of adventure." [...] He was {{rejected}} by the Royal Navy because of poor eyesight, and then tried to become a foreign correspondent, but his highest achievement in that vein was to become a clerk at the Daily Mail tabloid. While his life in crime did provide excitement, Reynolds said in 2003, [...] "I've always felt that I can't escape my past. And in many <b>ways</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that it is like a line from the 'Ancient Mariner' and that the notoriety was like an albatross around my neck." ...|$|R

[...] An April 2008 article in Britain's Daily Mail listed Dirty Dancing as number one {{on a list of}} [...] "most romantic movie quotes ever", for Baby's line: [...] "I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> when I'm with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that happened to me in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell {{took the}} paper, {{and ran the}} article over again. Then he said, [...] "If the thing did nothing more than get itself {{appreciated}} in that <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>feel</b> that it had done enough. I wonder who the fellow is! Could it be a woman?" ...|$|R

500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Lightfoot {{used the}} term navvies in his [...] "Canadian Railroad Trilogy," [...] a song written to commemorate Canada's centennial in 1967: [...] "We are the navvies who work upon the railway, swingin' our hammers in the bright, blazing sun." [...] The song debuted on CBC's [...] "100 Years Young" [...] and later {{appeared}} on the album The <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2015 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Anselmo {{spoke out against}} Pantera and his other band's usage of the Confederate flag claiming {{it was a mistake}} to use it on their merchandise, albums and other promotional material. Anselmo said [...] "These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn't. The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> and the group of people I've had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says 'Heritage, not hate.' I'm not so sure I'm buying into that." [...] Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it was never about promoting hate.|$|E

2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove {{to me that}} you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way."

2500|$|... "Canadian Railroad Trilogy" [...] {{is a song}} by Gordon Lightfoot that {{describes}} {{the building of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway. This song was commissioned by the CBC for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967, to start Canada's Centennial year. It appeared on Lightfoot's The <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> album later in the same year. Lightfoot re-recorded the track on his 1975 compilation album, Gord's Gold, with full orchestration (arranged by Lee Holdridge). A live version also appears on his 1969 album Sunday Concert. Additionally, the song was covered by John Mellencamp, George Hamilton IV, and James Keelaghan who performed the song on the Lightfoot tribute album, [...] In 2001, Gordon Lightfoot's [...] "Canadian Railroad Trilogy" [...] was honoured as one of the Canadian MasterWorks by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his college}} years, Strait joined the country band Stoney Ridge, {{answering}} a flyer the band posted around campus {{looking for a}} new vocalist. Strait renamed the group the Ace in the Hole Band and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different honky-tonks and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as Huntsville and Houston. They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as The Texas Playboys. Soon, his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles including [...] "That Don't Change The <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> About You," [...] and [...] "I Can't Go On Dying Like This" [...] for the Houston-based D label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day in order to make some extra cash.|$|E
