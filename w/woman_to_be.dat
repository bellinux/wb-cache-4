5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard.

The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed by electric chair.|$|E
