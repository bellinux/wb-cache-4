25|$|On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, {{which had}} widely been {{expected}} to release its findings from the statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as U.S. and ally envoys pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and {{to work out a}} power-sharing deal. A senior American official made the point of stating that Karzai and Abdullah together won more than 70% of the votes in the first round, ensuring the credibility of a government in which they shared power. A Karzai spokesman indicated that both foreign and Afghan officials were proffering formulas for power sharing, but that Karzai had rejected them and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> power sharing until after a winner is declared. Abdullah also reiterated that he would consider negotiating after the results were announced.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, Mohamed Atta rented a silver Hyundai Accent, which he booked from SIXT Rent-A-Car for July 9 to 16, and later {{extended}} to the 19th. He drove east out of Madrid towards the Mediterranean beach area of Tarragona. On the way, Atta stopped in Reus to pick up Ramzi bin al-Shibh at the airport. They drove to Cambrils, where they spent {{a night at the}} Hotel Monica. They checked out the next morning, and spent the next few days at an unknown location in Tarragona. The absence of other hotel stays, signed receipts or credit card stubs has led investigators to believe that the men may have met in a safe house provided by other al-Qaeda operatives in Spain. There, Atta and bin al-Shibh held a meeting to complete the planning of the attacks. Several clues have been found to link their stay in Spain to Syrian-born Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas (Abu Dahdah), and Amer el Azizi, a Moroccan in Spain. They may have helped arrange and host the meeting in Tarragona. Yosri Fouda, who interviewed bin al-Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) before the arrest, believes that Said Bahaji and KSM may have also been present at the meeting. Spanish investigators have said that Marwan al-Shehhi and two others later joined the meeting. Bin al-Shibh <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> this meeting with Fouda.|$|E
500|$|Early American reviewers {{were divided}} on {{discussing}} the theological {{aspects of the}} Four Quartets. F. R. Leavis, in Scrutiny (Summer 1942), analysed the first three poems and discussed how the verse [...] "makes its explorations into the concrete realities of experience below the conceptual currency" [...] instead of their Christian themes. Muriel Bradbrook, in Theology (March 1943), did the opposite of F. R. Leavis and emphasised how Eliot captured Christian experience in general and how it relates to literature. D. W. Harding, in the Spring 1943 issue of Scrutiny, discussed the Pentecostal image but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> how it would relate to Eliot's Christianity. Although he appreciated Eliot's work, Paul Goodman believed that the despair found within the poem meant that Eliot {{could not be a}} Christian poet. John Fletcher felt that Eliot's understanding of salvation could not help the real world whereas Louis Untermeyer believed that not everyone would understand the poems.|$|E

On August 22, Army spokeswoman Lt. Col.

One reader in Maryland received {{a copy of}} the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a [...] "human error" [...] and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> possible penalties; however, the following day Scholastic {{announced that}} it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment. Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a [...] "complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book."

500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to me.... He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> anything with me.

500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E

White <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>discussed</b> the maliciousness of the NAACP's activities, as that issue was not properly before the Court.|$|R
25|$|Nissim ben Jacob's Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud {{argued that}} it was {{unnecessary}} for Judah the Prince to discuss them as many of these laws were so well known.

Similarly, there were then several decrees in place aimed at suppressing outward signs of national identity, including decrees against wearing tefillin and tzitzit; as conversion to Judaism was against Roman law, Judah <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>discussed</b> this.|$|R
50|$|There were {{discussions about}} {{improving}} {{the coordination of}} efforts by the Americans, British, and Canadians to develop an atomic bomb.

The engagement, often referred to as the [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, {{he covered}} the U.S. {{invasion}} of Grenada but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> these experiences until the publication of Kingdom of Fear 20 years later. Later that year, {{at the behest of}} Terry McDonell, he authored a piece for Rolling Stone called [...] "A Dog Took My Place," [...] an exposé of the scandalous Roxanne Pulitzer divorce and what he termed the [...] "Palm Beach lifestyle." [...] The article contained dubious insinuations of bestiality (among other things) but was considered to be a return to proper form by many. Shortly thereafter, Thompson accepted an advance to write about [...] "couples pornography" [...] for Playboy. As part of his research, in the spring of 1985 he spent evenings at the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre striptease club in San Francisco and his experience there eventually evolved into a full-length novel tentatively titled The Night Manager. Neither the novel nor the article has been published.|$|E
2500|$|The {{terms of}} the Armistice of Mudros between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies {{required}} the Ottomans pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus. The departure of the Ottomans created a power vacuum in the border area, in particular that between Armenia and Georgia. [...] Armenia and Georgia began bilateral talks in November 1918, with Georgia sending a special envoy to Yerevan. Simultaneously, Georgia invited the recently independent governments of the Caucasus to Tbilisi for a conference with the principal aim of addressing boundary delimitation and issues of common concern. The general idea of a conference was well received by the Armenian government however the Armenia government took exception to the scope and quick timelines of the conference. In particular, Armenia {{was not interested in}} discussing border issues at a conference. Armenia indicated it would participate, recognizing the rapidly changing political environment following World War I, but reemphasized that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> the issues of delimitation. In general, however, Georgia was of the position that the border with Armenia should be inline with the border of the former Russian imperial Tiflis Province; whereas, Armenia was of the position that the border should correspond to ethnic composition or more historical boundaries.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 July 2008, German Foreign Minister Steinmeier {{met with}} his Georgian {{counterpart}} Eka Tkeshelashvili in Tbilisi. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the return of refugees to Abkhazia was [...] "entirely unrealistic at this stage." [...] He said [...] "the situation first needs to be improved and trust restored." [...] On {{the evening of the}} same day, Steinmeier met with Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili in Batumi. Saakashvili said at a briefing that Tbilisi had no intention of using force to retake Abkhazia. Steinmeier said that Germany supported the territorial integrity of Georgia and considered Abkhazia to be Georgia's inalienable part. On 18 July, Steinmeier met with Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh in Gali. After his meeting with Steinmeier, Bagapsh said that Abkhazia still <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> German peace proposal. Bagapsh also said he planned to submit his own counterproposal. On the same day, Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Lavrov called for an internationally developed [...] "road map" [...] to resolve the tensions over Abkhazia. However, Lavrov said the German plan was flawed because it called for the return of Georgian refugees as part of the first phase instead of {{at the end of the}} process. Steinmeier also met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.|$|E
2500|$|According to Duff, {{the album}} chronicles her {{experiences}} {{over the year}} before its release: [...] "some of its good, {{and some of its}} bad, and a lot of its, like, a big learning experience", she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material ("Well, I'm not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops") than the songs on Metamorphosis (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this time because I got to really do it how I wanted to." [...] Duff called the album [...] "different [...] " [...] Metamorphosis and [...] "much more mature", particularly in its [...] "sound", but not {{to the point where it}} would be inappropriate for children; [...] "I just think that other people will relate better", she said. According to her, she was more [...] "involved" [...] compared to the production of her first album and [...] "confident enough to make suggestions" [...] about the style of the album: [...] "If I thought it needed to be more heavy, more rock, I said so". Its US release date, October 4, 2004, was a week after Duff's seventeenth birthday.|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old {{woman from}} Dallas, Texas, fell [...] {{to her death}} while riding the New Texas Giant roller coaster. According to one {{eyewitness}} account, the victim, who was overweight, was concerned about being properly secured after boarding the ride because her restraints clicked once while the other restraints click three times. A ride attendant assured her {{that as long as}} she heard a click, it was secure. Other eyewitnesses believed the seat restraint locked into place normally and reported seeing it in the lowered position when the roller coaster returned. Some riders informed investigators that the woman was thrown from the roller coaster as it rounded a turn, and one rider tweeted that he saw the restraint come undone. The ride closed for two months during the investigation. The victim was found on top of the metal roof of one of the coaster tunnels, near the Music Mill Amphitheater. Due to the similarity of Texas Giant and Iron Rattler, Six Flags Fiesta Texas ceased running the new Iron Rattler pending investigation findings from Six Flags Over Texas. In under a month, Iron Rattler reopened on August 14 with seat belts as another added restraint to the two trains. Representatives from Gerstlauer, the German company that designed and built the ride's trains, are planning on participating in the investigation. While Gerstlauer <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>discuss</b> specifics of the incident, the company did state that their restraint system could not open while the ride was in motion. Then on September 10, 2013, Six Flags Over Texas released a statement stating that the park has finished its investigation on the recent incident and will reopen the Texas Giant on September 14, 2013. With the reopening of the coaster the park has re-designed the restraint-bar pads and added seat-belts to the three trains and added a test seat at the entrance so riders can test if they are able to ride. The woman's family filed lawsuits against both the park and manufacturer. The park and manufacturer subsequently sued each other saying the other was responsible for the accident. On November 18, 2014, attorneys for the victim's family announced that they had reached an undisclosed settlement with both Six Flags and Gerstlauer, with a spokesperson saying the family [...] "is very pleased with the settlement and appreciates the condolences offered by Six Flags and Gerstlauer".|$|E
