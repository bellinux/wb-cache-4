40|$|Two {{groups of}} <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> {{are found in}} Iowa croplands: the true <b>white</b> <b>grub,</b> which can cause {{significant}} stand loss in corn and sometimes soybean; and the annual <b>white</b> <b>grub,</b> which probably does not cause stand loss in either crop. True <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> are the larvae of June beetles (the big brown beetles that fly around yard lights during May and June evenings). They feed on the roots of seedling plants, causing them to wilt and die. True <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> have a 3 -year life cycle and can reduce plant populations during 2 of these 3 years.

30|$|As {{for field}} trials, sites were chosen wherefrom farmers had {{reported}} serious crop damage by <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> the previous season. Population levels of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> were assessed through soil samplings prior to planting and again during weeding 15  days after crop emergence and during earthing up of Irish potatoes. Natural <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> populations were between 1 and 4 grubs per square metre. The dominant <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> genera were Anomala and Hoplochelus species as per morphological and DNA comparisons.

The efficacy of Beauveria brongniartii, Beauveria bassiana, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora {{in the form of}} water suspension and infested grain was tested against a control treatment. The initial number of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> (April 12; 39 white grubs/m 2) was reduced with all tested entomopathogens up until the third evaluation (May 26; 32 white grubs/m 2). However, the studied treatments were not sufficient to reduce the <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> population in the soils below the economical threshold (20 individuals/m 2). The average number of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> was affected mostly by the treatment where the active ingredient was B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>grubs</b> are larvae of Coleoptera of {{the family}} Scarabaeidae. They are known because of their {{intensive}} feeding habits on crop roots. Mallophora ruficauda (Diptera: Asilidae) is a dipteran parasitoid whose larva is a natural enemy for <b>white</b> <b>grubs.</b> This species is a solitary ectoparasitoid, where both female and larva realize different steps in the host location process. Female place its eggs in high grasslands and then, the larva finds and parasitizes the host in the ground. There are nine potential hosts {{in the area of}} action of this parasitoid; however a high preference for Cyclocephala signaticollis has been observed (87 % of field parasitism). It is known that many insects have developed defensive and immunological mechanisms when attacked by a parasitoid, which can be behavioral, physiological, chemical or genetic. The objectives of this work were to investigate what kind of defense and non-immunological associated mechanisms the <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> have against this parasitoid and to understand why M. ruficauda have such a high preference for masked chafer grubs or Cyclocephala species. In particular, for each <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> species, we asked: (1) If there is a differential behavioral reaction when a parasitoid attack is simulated; (2) If body attributes of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> species have influence on defense behavior, and particularly for the masked chafer C.  signaticollis; and (3) Why this species is the most selected by M. ruficauda.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>grubs</b> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and damaging pests in turfgrass habitats of the Northeast U. S. and their management is highly dependent on chemical pesticides. Best IPM is constrained by widespread reliance on early season preventive applications of imidacloprid {{as well as by}} a lack of biologically-based control alternatives. Part of the solution would be curative alternatives that would permit sampling and better decision-making, and biobased alternatives that could supplant reliance on chemical insecticides. This project?s focus on <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> control in turfgrass thereby represents the major pest complex {{in one of the most}} extensive and rapidly expanding components of our urban and rural landscape. As managed ecosystems, extensive and diverse turfgrass habitats require decision-making strategies to maintain them for their intended uses. Better managing this vast area will have huge positive impacts, especially considering that this habitat is intimately associated with human populations and that home owners can spray lawn chemicals with little regulation or training. Synergistic combinations of selected biological and chemical control products are one approach that might yield valuable alternatives for the management of soil insect pests. Chapter 1 summarizes laboratory studies that were conducted on third instar <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> challenged by individual control products. The objective was to measure variation in the susceptibility of four invasive species of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> (Amphimallon majale, Anomala orientalis, Maladera castanea and Popillia japonica) to 18 registered and experimental insecticides used as curative controls under controlled laboratory conditions. Across <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> species, the most efficacious biological and chemical insecticide alternatives were the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema scarabaei and chlorpyrifos, respectively. Biorationals were highly variable across target species. For biorational and chemical insecticides, A. majale was the least susceptible species. For biologicals, P. japonica was the least susceptible. Considering all control products, A. orientalis was the most susceptible. Chapter 2 summarizes a series of laboratory, greenhouse and field trials that were conducted on third instar <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> challenged by combinations of control products. The objective was to screen numerous combinations of biological and sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides against third instars under controlled laboratory conditions, and then to characterize those interactions as synergistic, additive or antagonistic. The most promising combinations were advanced to greenhouse pot studies and then to microplot field trials. To reveal variation across <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> species, trials were conducted on A. majale and P. japonica. Among the combinations of biological and neonicotinoids tested here, results revealed that synergistic interactions are relatively uncommon, and involved only entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi. For A. majale, the most promising synergistic combinations were between H. bacteriophora and both neonicotinoids; across all laboratory, greenhouse and field trials. In contrast, for P. japonica the most promising synergistic combinations were between B. bassiana and M. anisopliae Met F 52 with clothianidin and M. anisopliae NYSAES with imidacloprid. Like A. majale, this was discernible in each of the two laboratory trials, but did not persist through to the greenhouse and field. Finally, an antagonistic interaction between Bt-products and both neonicotinoids was common to both <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> species. The magnitude of variation in susceptibility across <b>white</b> <b>grub</b> species supports the idea that a single product will not reliably suppress populations of all scarab taxa. This differential susceptibility could have broader consequences for grub management, if a numerically dominant target species is more completely suppressed than a co-occurring species. Synergistic combinations of biological control products with reduced rates of neonicotinoid insecticides could be a promising approach for the curative control of <b>white</b> <b>grubs</b> and as an IPM tool for the suppression of other soil insect pests...|$|R

30|$|The small arena bioassays {{revealed}} {{that all the}} four tested Rwandan EPN species/strains were able to infect and kill <b>white</b> <b>grubs,</b> although it took quite {{a high number of}} infective juveniles per grub larva. Nevertheless, this is considered a good basis for further research, as it is often not too easy to find EPNs being infectious to grubs as they are often able to defend themselves to EPNs or other ground-living natural enemies (Ansari et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2013; Laznik and Trdan, 2015). And other EPNs, such as S. scarabaei, are not easily mass-produced. Consequently, there are only few EPN products on the market against <b>white</b> <b>grubs,</b> globally.
