25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} about the neurological basis of dreaming. This includes the activation synthesis theory—the theory that dreams result from brain stem activation during REM sleep; the continual activation theory—the theory that dreaming {{is a result of}} activation and synthesis but dreams and REM sleep are controlled by different structures in the brain; and dreams as excitations of long term memory—a theory which claims that long term memory excitations are prevalent during <b>waking</b> <b>hours</b> as well but are usually controlled and become apparent only during sleep.|$|E
25|$|Further {{studies have}} looked at the {{specific}} effects of different stages of sleep on different types of memory. For example, it has been found that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but can produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set shown). Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Another study reported that the performance on free recall of a list of nouns is significantly worse when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 ± 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 ± 4 words). These results indicate the role of sleep on declarative memory formation. This has been further confirmed by observations of low metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex and temporal and parietal lobes for the temporal learning and verbal learning tasks respectively. Data analysis has also shown that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during <b>waking</b> <b>hours</b> or REM sleep. Also, post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (1 hour), indicating long term potentiation.|$|E
500|$|The size of {{an animal}} is also a factor in {{determining}} diet type (Allen's rule). Since small mammals have a high ratio of heat-losing surface area to heat-generating volume, {{they tend to have}} high energy requirements and a high metabolic rate. Mammals that weigh less than about [...] are mostly insectivorous because they cannot tolerate the slow, complex digestive process of an herbivore. Larger animals, on the other hand, generate more heat and less of this heat is lost. They can therefore tolerate either a slower collection process (those that prey on larger vertebrates) or a slower digestive process (herbivores). Furthermore, mammals that weigh more than [...] usually cannot collect enough insects during their <b>waking</b> <b>hours</b> to sustain themselves. The only large insectivorous mammals are those that feed on huge colonies of insects (ants or termites).|$|E

500|$|Because {{they get}} so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 {{hours a day}}; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement. They are {{predominantly}} active at night and {{spend most of their}} <b>waking</b> <b>hours</b> feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day. On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. [...] The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting. On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy. On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours. The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the height}} of limerence, {{thoughts}} of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven': indeed, limerence {{is first and foremost}} a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with obsessive–compulsive disorder. All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality, because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible. [...] At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's <b>waking</b> <b>hours</b> completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family. [...] For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.

A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band; in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures.

2500|$|Most {{practitioners}} {{will agree}} that spasm/ strain/ pain in any muscle {{can often be}} treated by regular stretching exercise of that muscle, no matter {{the cause of the}} pain. [...] Stretching is recommended every two to three <b>waking</b> <b>hours.</b> Anterior and posterior movement of the hip joint capsule may help optimize the patient's stretching capacity. The muscle can be manually stretched by applying pressure perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and parallel {{to the surface of the}} buttocks until the muscle is relaxed. Another stretching exercise is to lie on the side opposite of the pain with the hip and knee of the upper leg flexed and adducted towards the ground while the torso is rotated so that the back of the upper shoulder touches the ground. Physical Therapists may suggest stretching exercises that will target the piriformis, but may also include the hamstrings and hip muscles in order to adequately reduce pain and increase range of motion. Patients with piriformis syndrome may also find relief from applications of ice which will help reduce inflammation and so may help limit pressure on the sciatic nerve. This treatment can be helpful when pain starts or immediately after an activity that is likely to cause pain. [...] As the length of time progresses, heat may provide temporary relief from many types of muscle pain and will temporarily increase muscle flexibility.|$|E
2500|$|Previous {{research}} has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a serial reaction time task (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous <b>waking</b> <b>hours.</b> However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to {{be a result of}} the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups. [...] To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task. [...] They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group), [...] whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness. [...] Results of [...] PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group. [...] In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task. [...] This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information. [...] This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep. [...] Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF).|$|E
