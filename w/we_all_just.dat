500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>just</b> sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] see what we can afford. The film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>just</b> thought it would be fun to do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|E

Three months later, however, the producers for The Office mounted [...] "an 11th-hour effort last month" [...] to get Carell to make a cameo in the show's final episode, according to TVLine.

TVLine later reported on May 6, that Carell would appear in a cameo, although NBC declined to comment and Carell's representatives continued to deny the reports. Carell, however, did end up returning for the finale; his character, Michael Scott, becomes Dwight's best man at his wedding. A month after the episode aired, Carell explained in an interview with TVLine that he [...] "lied for months to the press, to almost everyone, really". He noted that he [...] "felt terribly for the cast and for [...] Greg Daniels, because they all lied, too." [...] Krasinski, on the other hand, explained that [...] "It was so thrilling. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>just</b> flat-out lied … It was just one of those things that we all vowed and had to protect".|$|E

Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each one knows that they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's something to be said about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with because they see what he's done out here." ...|$|E
