5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go down the other side.|$|E
25|$|After he left school, {{his father}} Bob Hewson, {{told him he}} could live at home for one year but if {{he was not able to}} pay his own <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to leave the house.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Another Rainbow {{took up the}} {{daunting}} task of collecting the entire Disney comic book oeuvre of Barks—over 500 stories in all—in the ten-set, thirty-volume Carl Barks Library. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks´ pages in pristine black and white line art, {{as close as possible to}} the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> originally drawn them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.|$|E
60|$|The man on {{the lounge}} nodded. A species of despair was upon him. This man was his master in all <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> be his master to the end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good lord! what an argument," [...] {{he exclaimed}} and relapsed into silence. Had he been {{accustomed}} to natives and their <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have understood the point much better than he did, though I admit {{it is difficult to}} explain.|$|R
60|$|Poor Mr. May had {{to gather}} {{together}} his wits and his sprightliness for his next meeting. He had decided he must make a percentage in other <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> schemed in all known <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> accept the ten pounds--but really, did ever you hear of anything so ridiculous in your life, ten pounds!--dirty old screw, dirty, screwing old woman! <b>He</b> <b>would</b> accept the ten pounds; but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get his own back.|$|R
25|$|Related, yet {{different}} was {{the notion}} of male beauty. When a boy at young age {{turned out to be}} very handsome, he would be barred from heavy work, instead he would be pampered, his skin rubbed with oils, his hair meticulously taken care of, and so on. The idea was that in this <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> grow up to such a beauty that he would be irresistible to chief's daughters. Then a child of high rank would be born into the family, elevating the status of all.|$|E
25|$|Berlusconi {{remained}} as caretaker prime minister {{for a little}} over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was supported by most of the opposition parties, but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi.|$|E
25|$|Philip and Eliot are in bed; Philip {{gets up to}} do the dishes. He thinks back to {{how they}} met through Sally. Back to the parents, Owen gets back to his apartment, soaked through. Philip and Eliot then wake up; Philip seems keen on flatmate Jerene's {{research}} on lost languages. There is then an account of Jerene's childhood up to her coming out to her parents and being spurned by them. Philip and Eliot then talk about their experiences with men. Philip goes on to remember the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> masturbate a lot and how he tried to ask girls out - and they refused. Finally, he recalls going to a gay pornographic cinema when he was seventeen.|$|E
50|$|Disbanding Team Canada as {{a result}} of their overly {{cheating}} <b>ways</b> (<b>he</b> <b>would</b> later offer them a match which, if they won, would allow them to stay as a unit, with the winner to get a future shot at the championship of their choice; they would lose the match).|$|R
60|$|Mr. Britling had {{got into}} it very much as he had got into the ditch on the morning before his smash. He hadn't thought the affair out and he hadn't looked {{carefully}} enough. And it kept on developing in just the <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather that it didn't.|$|R
50|$|Andy {{regularly}} used reverse psychology {{on people}} making them see {{the error of}} their <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> help transgressors by enabling them to draw their own moral conclusions. Andy had a keen eye for booby traps, and often shielded Barney from both career and social landmines. Andy's pride in and love for his hometown is very evident in his work and his homelife.|$|R
25|$|Lindros was {{selected}} first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. Lindros had signaled {{in advance that}} he would never play for the Nordiques, citing the city's isolation, lack of marketing potential, and French character. Despite this, the team selected him anyway. Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround, and refused to trade Lindros, saying that the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play in the NHL would be in a Nordiques uniform. While he awaited a trade, Lindros spent the time playing with the Generals and also participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal with Canada.|$|E
25|$|De Valera's {{government}} {{followed the}} policy of unilaterally dismantling the treaty of 1921. In this <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the Irish Defence Forces and the Gardaí. He also refused to dismiss from office those Cumann na nGaedheal, Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss Eoin O'Duffy from his position as Garda Commissioner after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the Army Comrades Association (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna Fáil supporters following {{the publication of the}} article: No Free Speech for Traitors by Peadar O'Donnell, an IRA member.|$|E
500|$|In August 1860, Müller {{wrote to}} the members of Convocation about his plans to teach a broad range of topics in {{addition}} to Sanskrit, including comparative philology, Indian history, and literature. Simply teaching the language [...] "would be but a mean return" [...] for Boden's generosity, he wrote. In this <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> help to supply [...] "efficient" [...] missionaries, [...] "useful" [...] civil servants, and [...] "distinguished" [...] Boden scholars.|$|E
5000|$|Five (Seán Cullen): The most childlike of the monsters, {{he speaks}} very few words {{and has a}} thick speech {{impediment}} when he does. Five has a voracious appetite and loves {{his brothers and sisters}} very much. Sometimes his silly antics annoy Four. He has an enormous tongue which he can control in various <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> usually say sorry for every mistake he makes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{likely he}} thought things were growing {{too hot for}} him," [...] was Phil's comment, when the boys talked the matter over. [...] "He {{probably}} realized that if he continued {{to go to the}} stores and get goods the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be caught sooner or later." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the restless}} nights, {{after he had}} been asleep all day, fits of blind rage came upon Simmonr and held him till he trembled all over, while he thought in how many {{different}} <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> slay Losson. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>would</b> picture himself trampling the life out of the man, with heavy ammunition-boots, and at others smashing in his face with the butt, and at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the neckbone cracked. Then his mouth would feel hot and fevered, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin.|$|R
500|$|George Formby (born James Lawler Booth; 4 October 1875– 8 February 1921) was an English comedian {{and singer}} in musical theatre, {{known as one}} of the {{greatest}} music hall performers of the early 20th century. His comedy played upon Lancashire stereotypes, and he was popular around Britain. His nickname, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale", was coined because of the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> use his bronchial cough as a comedic device in his act.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{recalled}} that Joseph {{sat in a}} chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad." [...] Both of Jackson's parents have rejected the longstanding allegations of child abuse by saying that spankings were common when disciplining children back then. The child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings, with some of them rejecting the claims.|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{filmed in}} the One Eyed Jacks casino and brothel were shot on {{location}} {{at a house}} on the shore of California's Malibou Lake; footage for several episodes were shot on the same day by different directors so as to scatter the scenes throughout the episodes that required them. Deschanel has expressed regret over the use of a [...] "house style" [...] in the series' direction and cinematography, feeling that he lit certain scenes in this episode in a <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not usually have done; preferring to have employed a chiaroscuro use of shadow as opposed to the reddish tints used throughout.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then--and then--though I tried him in many <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say no more, so, feeling hate {{against this}} Unknown rising in my heart, and fearing lest I should utter {{words that were}} best unsaid, I left him. Now I bid you, search the books which are open to your wisdom and tell me of this woman whom he seeks, who she is, and where she dwells. Oh! search them swiftly, that I may find her and--kill her if I can." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shaw {{noted in}} his diary on 17 October 1889, that he had written to Edmund Yates asking that he give the {{position}} of art critic at The World to Lady Colin Campbell. Shaw's easily readable art and music reviews appeared regularly in The World and The Star, but as his time was taken up in other <b>ways,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> gladly resign from what he regarded as a bore. Much later <b>he</b> <b>would</b> write to Frank Harris, [...] "From Lady Colin Campbell onward, I have been familiar with celebrated beauties and with what {{is by no means}} the same thing, really beautiful women." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{does not}} mean, however, {{they do not}} get along outside of work. Though they do not {{consider}} each other to be friends, their deep business relationship and {{respect for each other}} is evident. Hamada has said if they ever parted <b>ways,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> [...] "never do comedy again," [...] as there is no one else <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to make his partner (Matsumoto has expressed similar views). He has also said he saves his best tsukkomi material for Matsumoto. Tanaka of Cocorico reports seeing Matsumoto become visibly concerned whenever Hamada is sick and unable to come to work.|$|R
500|$|In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid {{states that}} what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl {{apart from other}} female {{characters}} was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, [...] "she wears his symbol on her chest, {{but she is not}} his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden." [...] Because of the fact she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, [...] "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> a male." [...] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that Barbara Gordon's Batgirl reflected the Women's liberation movement of the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} The Great American Bash was between The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and The Undertaker. On the May 27 episode of SmackDown!, Paul Heyman told The Dudleys to [...] "make an impact". As {{part of the}} storyline, The Dudleys responded by abducting Paul Bearer, Undertaker's manager. The {{following}} week, Heyman told Undertaker that the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever see Bearer again, was to align himself with The Dudleys. Two weeks later, on the June 17 episode of SmackDown!, a Handicap match between The Dudleys and The Undertaker was booked for The Great American Bash, with the stipulation being if Undertaker lost, Bearer, {{as part of the}} scripted events, would be cemented in a glass crypt.|$|E
500|$|Building on {{the success}} of their singles in the United States, and riding {{on the back of the}} British Invasion, Them {{undertook}} a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The Doors were the supporting act on the last week, and Morrison's influence on the Doors singer, Jim Morrison, was noted by John Densmore in his book Riders On The Storm. Brian Hinton relates how [...] "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks." [...] On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on [...] "Gloria".|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing this}} the herald shouted back {{that we should}} {{every one of us}} be dead before noon if <b>he</b> had his <b>way.</b> Still, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> report my words {{faithfully}} to Quabie and bring his answer.|$|R
60|$|Now, not {{far from}} where he lived, and beside the river, stood a willow-tree, and thither the lucky beggar took his purse of money and stuffed it into a knot-hole of a {{withered}} branch, then went his way, certain that nobody would think of looking for money in such a hiding-place. Then {{all the rest of the}} day he sat thinking and thinking of the <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> spend what had been given him, and what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do to get the most good out of it. At last came evening, and his brother, who had been begging in another part of the town, came home again.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel laughed; {{he liked}} her to talk that <b>way,</b> and promised <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hold up a while.|$|R
500|$|The film {{centers on}} the {{relationship}} between Becket and Mori, but is not a love story in a conventional sense. Both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. While learning to pilot their Jaeger, they undergo a process of [...] "opening up", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. Their relationship is necessarily one of respect and [...] "perfect trust". Hunnam commented that the film is [...] "a love story without a love story. It's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself". Both Becket and Mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically [...] "become one", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. Del Toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> a sex scene.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{described}} the opening scene—in which Scully discovers {{the truth about}} death, sadness, and sorrow—as [...] "a <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never imagined an X-Files episode to begin with", and that the related scene with Scully's tombstone was [...] "a soft but beautiful opening" [...] that [...] "sets up the episode in a frightening way". The image of Scully in the boat was meant to symbolize [...] "being tethered to something very tenuously, {{and that there was}} a chance for you to be cut adrift and slip into the unknown". Skinner facing the Smoking Man placed the character as [...] "both an antagonistic and institutional figure" [...] that tries to be both an FBI agent and an ally of Mulder and Scully—his refusal to allow the Smoking Man to smoke in his office [...] "speaks of [...] alliances and allegiances to Agent Scully and his hatred of this man he cannot vanquish, he cannot get rid of, but he has to tolerate".|$|E

[...] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while [...] "Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect {{as a symbol of the}} emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Silas Lapham," [...] {{returned}} his wife, [...] "I do believe you've got mineral {{paint on the}} brain. Do you suppose a fellow like young Corey, brought up the <b>way</b> <b>he's</b> been, <b>would</b> touch mineral paint with a ten-foot pole?" ...|$|R
60|$|Santerre was {{for letting}} the mob have its <b>way,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> willingly have thrown it the prey {{for which it}} clamoured; but orders were orders, and in the year I. of the Revolution it was not good to disobey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we did--heard a howl or two. Does {{that prove}} anybody was killed? Course it don't. And we seen four men run, then this one come walking {{out and we}} took it for a ghost. No more ghost than you are. It was Jake Dunlap his own self, and it's Jake Dunlap now. He's been and got his hair cropped, the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> and <b>he's</b> playing himself for a stranger, {{just the same as}} <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> Ghost?
