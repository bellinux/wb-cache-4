5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E

500|$|Koppel appealed {{against this}} decision, calling {{it and the}} process by which it was reached [...] "deficient and unlawful"; he insisted that re-basing in Milton Keynes was the only way Wimbledon could survive. Burns {{expressed}} strong personal opposition in response, declaring that allowing such a move would [...] "destroy what football is about". To consider whether Wimbledon had the right to contest the League's decision, the Football Association formed an ad hoc arbitration panel made up of FA vice-chairman and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, York City chairman Douglas Craig, and Charles Hollander QC. Craig was a controversial choice for some because of his actions as York chief; he had sold his club's stadium Bootham Crescent to a holding company he also owned for £165,000 in July 1999, then in December 2001 announced his intention to evict the team and sell the ground for £4.5million.

500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E
