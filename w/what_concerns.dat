5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. <b>What</b> <b>concerns</b> some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|In the {{literary}} underground, Bonciu enjoyed some popularity among the Optzeciști writers—some {{of whom were}} disciples of Crohmălniceanu, trying to reconnect themselves with the 1930s avant-garde. Poet-novelist Mircea Cărtărescu became a noted supporter of Bonciu's reconsideration, and listed him among the direct precursors of Romania's postmodern literature. Published later in Cărtărescu's life, the Orbitor cycle is seen by Irimescu as evidence of Cărtărescu's debt to Bonciu and Blecher. Another member of the Optzeciști clubs, poet Florin Iaru, has also been described as one in succession to Bonciu, particularly in <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> the Expressionist imagery of his poems. Sonia Larian, a more senior author (but one whose work was only published in the 1980s), is also seen as a disciple of Bonciu, for her scenes of Jewish life in Bucharest.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Buttons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two {{construction}} {{features a}} lapel that hides the third button, {{in order to}} provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, and it means “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} buttonhole, but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> the buttons on the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other mosaics {{found in}} the region, the Reḥob mosaic has {{very little in the}} form of ornate design and {{symmetric}} patterns, but is unique due to its inscription, acclaimed by scholars {{to be one of the}} most important epigraphical findings discovered in Israel in the last century. Its text sheds invaluable light on the historical geography (toponymy) of Palestine during the Roman and late-Byzantine periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in the region of Beit Shean (Scythopolis) and the Jordan valley, Sussitha (Hippos) and its neighboring cities on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, Naveh (Nawā) in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, Tyre and its neighboring cities to the south, as well as towns in the vicinity of Sebaste and Caesarea, and Ashqelon to the south. By delineating the boundaries of the Land of Israel, it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian captivity, and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> the laws of Seventh Year produce, and of demai-produce. The mosaic also describes different kinds of fruits and vegetables that were cultivated in the country at the time.|$|E

The links between Isac and Blaga had earlier been noted by Călinescu, who suggested that the innovative elements in Maica cea tânără already announce the [...] "stylized iconography" [...] of Blaga's works for the stage, [...] "which is in effect a Transylvanian perspective on things". Gigurcu also notes that Isac's influence in Maramureş was eventually reflected in the poems of Gheorghe Pârja, in <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> their common view of the rural-urban confrontation.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Department of Justice {{started its}} case against Trifa in 1975, {{the core of}} its {{argument}} being that he entered the United States under false pretenses, hiding his Iron Guard membership. American authorities also reported that Trifa had mentioned his interment in Nazi camps, but had not {{made it clear that}} he had benefited from preferential treatment. In October 1976, a group of members of the Concerned Jewish Youth organization took over the headquarters of the National Council of Churches building, as a protest against the refusal of the organization to oust Trifa. The archbishop was ousted from the body in November, after the Council stated that, in <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> Nazi atrocities, [...] "we cannot allow any doubt about a complete repudiation".|$|E

2500|$|Such nuances notwithstanding, H. Bonciu's {{contribution}} was readily annexed {{to the school}} of Romanian Expressionism. Dan Grigorescu traces the literary phenomenon to its source: [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> H. Bonciu, critics have passed a more resolute judgment than on any other Romanian writer to have ever been considered a bearer of Expressionist ideas: he was without doubt the one who generated least debate." [...] After it became a point of reference, the definition of Bonciu's work as [...] "Expressionist" [...] created some debate among 20th-century scholars. The issue was notably raised by researcher Ovidiu Cotruș, who found it improbable that Romanian Expressionism was as diverse as to reunite the mystical poetry of Lucian Blaga and the crude language of Bagaj.... He therefore demanded some kind of critical revision. However, according to cultural historian Ion Pop, Bonciu remains Romania's only [...] "integral Expressionist", although, even in this context, Bonciu's work [...] "did not record any significant [...] shakes".|$|E
2500|$|The charismatic {{leadership}} {{represented by}} Codreanu has drawn comparisons with models favored by other leaders of far right and fascist movements, including Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Payne and German historian Ernst Nolte proposed that, among European far rightists, Codreanu was most like Hitler in <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> fanaticism. In Payne's view, however, he was virtually unparalleled in demanding [...] "self-destructiveness" [...] from his followers. Mayall, who admits the Legion [...] "was inspired {{in large measure}} by National Socialism and fascism", argues that Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's vision of omul nou, although akin to the [...] "new man" [...] of Nazi and Italian doctrines, is characterized by an unparalleled focus on mysticism. Historian Renzo De Felice, who dismisses the notion that Nazism and fascism are connected, also argues that, due to Legionary attack on [...] "bourgeois values and institutions", which the fascist ideology wanted instead to [...] "purify and perfect", Codreanu [...] "was not, strictly speaking, a fascist." [...] Spanish historian Francisco Veiga argued that [...] "fascization" [...] was a process experienced by the Guard, accumulating traits over a more generic nationalist fiber.|$|E
2500|$|The Sibiu Circle's {{advocacy}} of Lovinescu's program attested {{the rejection of}} far right ideals. While acknowledging that the political context of the Second Vienna Award had made [...] "national sentiment" [...] more precious to Transylvanians than ever before, the text cautioned against a revival of nationalist exclusiveness in the literary field, and rested the fault for păşunism with the early 20th century Sămănătorul review. Negoiţescu had designed {{a portion of the}} letter as a lampoon targeting [...] "neo-Sămănătorists", whom he portrayed as demagogues camouflaged in modernist trappings: [...] "Burning with the fever of exultation when they yell out the word 'culture' at each and any street corner, all the headmasters of patriotism, or morals and of poetry, in love with the 'holy soil' only because they view it from the comfortable armchairs of the city they still curse, the păşunists imagine themselves day and night at the plow horns". In a 1969 letter protesting against marginalization by communists, the author himself argued: [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>concerns</b> the politically unfavorable atmosphere that has been created around my name, it seems curious to me that those who support it will not bear in mind that, in 1943, I was the author of the Sibiu Literary Circle's Manifesto, through which we protested against fascist ideology." [...] He also insisted that his anti-fascist credentials were being recognized by several works of literary history published in the late 1960s. Commenting on the nature of his 1943 letter, Bogdan Creţu nevertheless rated it as an updated version of Lovinescu's lifelong principles, rather than a manifesto of artistic difference. Also according to Creţu, the young critic's affiliations meant that he was not [...] "obtusely disregarding" [...] traditionalist literature in its entirety, noting that Negoiţescu was lenient when it came to poems by traditionalists such as George Coşbuc, Octavian Goga and Aron Cotruş.|$|E
