500|$|The Bears {{travelled}} to Heinz Field to {{face the}} winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0–2 {{for the first time}} in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17–14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5–3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, [...] "It’s tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It’s tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It’s an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> back there and protect. And it’s really hard to configure a pass rush to get close." [...] On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two.|$|E
2500|$|Kahane {{proposed}} an [...] "exchange of populations" [...] that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: [...] "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely {{it is time}} for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago." [...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E

2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1999, Kosovo Verification Mission leader William Walker accused Serb {{forces of}} {{responsibility}} for the Račak massacre, an accusation that was ultimately a leading factor in NATO's decision to bomb Yugoslavia later in the year. Bojić responded that Walker's statement was aimed at provoking a military intervention against Serbs. In the same period, he rejected suggestions for an international conference on Kosovo and urged western powers to force Albanian delegates to form a united negotiating team [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> finally <b>sit</b> down at a table like human beings and arrange to bring this sad drama to an end." ...|$|R

5000|$|Interviewed in 2012, Steadman {{said of the}} play, [...] "Overnight, {{that piece}} was {{incredibly}} powerful. ... They were very strong, identifiable characters.

But we’ve perhaps all got a bit of Beverly in us." [...] In a 2017 piece written for The Guardian, Leigh described Beverly as [...] "an aspirational working class girl who is totally preoccupied with appearances and received notions of behaviour and taste. A bundle of contradictions, she espouses the idea of people freely enjoying themselves, yet endlessly bullies everybody into doing what she wrongly thinks they’ll enjoy, or what is good for them. But, while she may be perceived as monstrous, she is in fact vulnerable, insecure and sad".|$|R
5000|$|After {{completing}} their record deal with Sony in 2004, Korn partnered with EMI and signed to Virgin Records. As {{part of this}} innovative arrangement, Virgin paid Korn $25 million upfront {{in exchange for a}} share in the profits of See You on the Other Side and the band's next album, including tours and merchandising. Virgin also received a 30 percent stake in the band's licensing, ticket sales and other revenue sources. [...] The album was recorded in Jonathan Davis' home studio which was used for the previous album, Take a Look in the Mirror, as well as the Queen of the Damned soundtrack and score. Davis stated [...] "We went through a lot of drama with Head leaving and getting off our label and making the album by ourselves." [...] Regarding Brian [...] "Head" [...] Welch's departure, James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer recalled [...] "There was kind of a moment where we didn't know {{what we were going to}} do and how we were going to continue. We kind of decided, 'OK, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sit</b> back and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> put out a greatest hits album and end this or <b>we</b> <b>can</b> use this opportunity and instead of looking at it as a loss, reinvent what we do.'" ...|$|R

For some days we shall be very idle there among the trees and rocks. There are boats on the lake and shady depths and wildernesses of pine-wood.
