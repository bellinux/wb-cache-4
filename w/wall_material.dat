The huge granite steps {{leading up to the}} main entrance were not in place (and would not be until 1940). Among the rooms being prepared at the last minute was the 1,000-seat circular auditorium {{at the rear of the}} second floor. Workers laid a cement floor for the auditorium (although this would later be replaced with marble). The marble <b>wall</b> <b>material</b> in the auditorium came from the Hilgartner Marble Co. of Baltimore, while the seating and woodwork came from the American Seating Co. of Grand Rapids. The fan-shaped ceiling and the frieze in the auditorium were designed by Louis Ludwig of Washington, D.C., while the installation of the ceiling and the frieze was done by the A.W. Lee Co. of Washington. Contractors were also busy installing sashes, windows, and ventilation grillwork throughout the building, and laying a cement floor in the memorial hall on the second floor. Bronze was used for the sashes, doors, doorjambs, and other exterior work where connection to the granite was required, and these items were installed by the William H. Jackson Co. of New York. The interior and exterior ironwork was supplied by the Alexandria Iron Works and the Washington Stair and Ornamental Iron Co. Other than the auditorium, no attempt was made to complete the first floor, the lodge rooms on the second floor, or any of the tower rooms in time for the dedication.|$|E

500|$|In most bacteria, a {{cell wall}} is {{present on the}} outside of the cell {{membrane}}. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope. A common bacterial cell <b>wall</b> <b>material</b> is peptidoglycan (called [...] "murein" [...] in older sources), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi, which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. The cell wall is absent in L-form bacteria. The main pathogenic types are some species of Mycoplasma.|$|E

2500|$|The {{article on}} the Geiger-Muller tube carries a more {{detailed}} account of the techniques used to detect photon radiation. For high energy gamma it largely relies on interaction of the photon radiation with the tube <b>wall</b> <b>material,</b> usually 1–2mm of chrome steel on a [...] "thick-walled" [...] tube, to produce electrons within the wall which can enter and ionize the fill gas. This is necessary as the low-pressure gas in the tube has little interaction with high energy gamma photons. However, for low energy photons there is greater gas interaction and the direct gas ionisation effect increases. With decreasing energy the wall effect gives way {{to a combination of}} wall effect and direct ionisation, until direct gas ionisation dominates. Due to the variance in response to different photon energies, windowless tubes employ what is known as [...] "energy compensation" [...] which attempts to compensate for these variations over a large energy range.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported that the}} cwa 1 mutation disturbed the deposition and assembly of secondary cell <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> in the cortical fiber of rice internodes. Genetic analysis revealed that cwa 1 is allelic to bc 1, which encodes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored COBRA-like protein with the highest homology to Arabidopsis COBRA-like 4 (COBL 4) and maize Brittle Stalk 2 (Bk 2). Our results suggested that CWA 1 /BC 1 {{plays a role in}} assembling secondary cell <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> at appropriate sites, enabling synthesis of highly ordered secondary cell wall structure with solid and flexible internodes in rice. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1, as well as its orthologs (COBL 4, Bk 2) and other BC 1 -like proteins in rice, shows weak similarity to a family II carbohydrate-binding module (CBM 2) of several bacterial cellulases. To investigate the importance of the CBM-like sequence of CWA 1 /BC 1 in the assembly of secondary cell <b>wall</b> <b>materials,</b> Trp residues in the CBM-like sequence, which is important for carbohydrate binding, were substituted for Val residues and introduced into the cwa 1 mutant.

40|$|Abstract. The {{interaction}} of plasma with the walls {{has been one}} of the critical issues in the devel-opment of fusion energy research. On the one hand, plasma induced erosion can seriously limit the lifetime of the wall components, while, on the other hand, eroded particles can be transported into the core plasma where they lead to dilution of the fusion plasma and to energy losses due to radi-ation. Low-Z <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> induce only small radiation losses in the plasma core but suer from large physical sputtering rates. Carbon based materials in addition suer from chemically induced erosion. High-Z <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> show signicantly smaller erosion but lead to large radiation losses. One of the main goals of present plasma{wall studies is to nd a special choice of <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> for steady state plasma scenarios that will provide an optimum with respect to fuel dilution, radiation losses, wall lifetime and fuel inventory in the walls. To obtain a better understanding of the processes and to estimate the plasma{wall interaction behaviour in future fusion devices the 3 -D Monte Carlo code ERO-TEXTOR, based originally on the ERO code, has been developed. It models the plasma{ wall interaction and transport processes in the vicinity of a surface positioned in the boundary layer of TEXTOR.

30|$|QTLs for BS, YM {{and cell}} <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> were {{detected}} {{at the same}} regions on chromosomes 5 and 11 (Fig. 4 a, b and c). The CSSLs on chromosome 11 had the characters of later maturity and short stature compared with those in other lines, which indicated that this phenotype affected the accumulation of cell <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> indirectly. These phenotypes might be caused by the hdb 3 allele from Koshihikari located in the long arm region on chromosome 11. This gene has a function of hybrid breakdown (Yamamoto et al. 2007). Hybrid breakdown (sterility or weakness in later generations) is commonly observed in crosses between indica and japonica (Oka 1988; Matsubara et al. 2007; Yamamoto et al. 2007). In rice, hybrid breakdown causes reduced tiller numbers, retarded growth with short culm and panicle, chlorosis of leaves, poor seed set and retarded root growth (Jiang et al. 2008; Sunohara et al. 2009).
