5|$|The Dornier Do 17, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift ("flying pencil"), was a light bomber of Nazi Germany during World War II. It was produced by Claudius Dornier's company, Dornier Flugzeugwerke. The aircraft was designed as a Schnellbomber ("fast bomber"), a light bomber which, in theory, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> fast that it could outrun defending fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} East London Line closure, no replacement bus service was provided across the River Thames through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. London Transport {{was concerned that}} demand <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> high and buses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> small that the frequency could have to be one bus every 30 seconds. There was also an issue that the Rotherhithe Tunnel is restricted to vehicles with a width no more than , which had been employed on previous occasions. However, by 2007 no such vehicles were commercially available that were low-floor compliant: the only ones with this width, as previously used, were minibuses with higher floors. As bus policy by this time was 100% low floor, it meant that no such service could be provided.|$|E
25|$|The sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride was {{directed}} by Darrell Rooney and produced by Jeannine Roussel, with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay. Disney believed that Simba's Pride <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> popular that it shipped 15 million copies to stores for the October 27 release date.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{limitations}} of the Larrousse LH94 Ford HB V8 package. As teammate to Érik Comas, at the 1994 European Grand Prix at Jerez, there were fears that both he and fellow newcomer Domenico Schiattarella <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> far off the pace that they would not beat Bertrand Gachot's horrible Pacific to the last grid spot.|$|E

25|$|Paramount {{put her in}} a thriller, This Gun for Hire (1942); {{her love}} {{interest}} was Robert Preston but she shared more scenes with Alan Ladd {{and the two of them}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> popular together they would be reteamed in lead roles for three more films. Both had cameos in Star Spangled Rhythm (1942), an all-star Paramount movie.|$|E
25|$|The final {{sequence}} where Jake LaMotta is {{in front}} of his mirror was filmed {{on the last day of}} shooting, requiring 19 takes, with only the 13th being used for the film.

25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: {{the two young men}} came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What critic <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There seemed to be no precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|E
25|$|During the {{planning}} of the Follo Line—a new high-speed connection between Oslo and Ski—there were proposals to connect it to the Bryn Diagonal. This was discarded by the National Rail Administration in 2014. The number of passenger trains on the new line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> high and operate at such speeds that the Follo Line could only be operated by freight trains at night. The complexity, cost and maintenance of an intersection was regarded as not worthwhile for the limited amount of traffic.|$|E
25|$|Not all U-2 {{incidents}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> benign, {{with three}} fatal accidents occurring in 1956 alone. The first fatal accident was on 15 May 1956, when the pilot stalled the aircraft during a post-takeoff maneuver that {{was intended to}} drop off the wingtip outrigger wheels. The second occurred on 31 August, when the pilot stalled the aircraft immediately after takeoff. On 17 September, a third aircraft disintegrated during ascent in Germany, also killing the pilot. There were other non-fatal incidents, including at least one {{that resulted in the}} loss of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Following the Reformation, {{the name}} of the church was {{shortened}} to Vrouwekerk because the original name, Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk, was considered too Catholic-sounding. The building was donated to the Huguenots (Calvinist refugees from the Southern Netherlands and France), coming into use as a Walloon church in 1584. As greater and greater numbers of religious refugees came to Leiden in the 17th Century, the parish grew to some 6,000 members. During services, the church <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> packed that the entire congration was forced to stand in order to make room for everyone.|$|E
25|$|For a climactic finale, De Palma {{staged a}} chase from the {{platform}} of the Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North) Station to the escalators of Grand Central Terminal. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed so that Pacino and his pursuers could dart from car to hurtling car. The {{length of the}} escalator scene during the climactic shoot out at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow. He had {{to piece together the}} sequences so that the audience <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> tied up in the action {{that they would not be}} thinking about how long the escalator was running.|$|E
25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E

25|$|This {{is often}} the fuel of choice for reactor designs that NASA produces, one {{advantage}} is that UN has a better thermal conductivity than UO2. Uranium nitride has a very high melting point. This fuel has the disadvantage that unless 15N was used (in place of the more common 14N) that {{a large amount of}} 14C would be generated from the nitrogen by the (n,p) reaction. As the nitrogen required for such a fuel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> expensive {{it is likely that the}} fuel would have to be reprocessed by pyroprocessing to enable the 15N to be recovered. It is likely that if the fuel was processed and dissolved in nitric acid that the nitrogen enriched with 15N would be diluted with the common 14N.|$|E
25|$|Most reactor designs rely on liquid {{hydrogen}} {{as both a}} coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, {{and in the case}} of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about , the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the station's perimeter fence.|$|E
25|$|The German Navy was for Germany mainly an {{instrument}} for putting political pressure on Britain. Before the war, Germany would {{have been willing to}} cease or moderate its naval competition with Britain but only in return for a promise of its neutrality in any European conflict. Hitler attempted the same thing by different methods, but he saw only one side of the picture like other German politicians. It is clear from his writings that he was enormously impressed with the part played by the prewar naval rivalry in creating bad {{relations between the two countries}}. Thus, he argued that the removal of this rivalry all that was necessary to obtain good relations. By making a free gift of an absence of naval competition, he hoped that relations between the two countries <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> improved that Britain should not, in fact, find it necessary to interfere with Germany's continental policy.|$|E
