5|$|In March 1888, while Mansfield's {{company was}} touring, Daniel E. Bandmann staged a {{competing}} production {{with the same}} name at Niblo's Garden. Bandmann's opening night (March 12) coincided with the Great Blizzard of 1888, and only five theatergoers braved the storm. One of the attendees was Sullivan, who <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> his competition. Bandmann's production inspired a letter from Stevenson to the New York Sun saying that only the Mansfield version was authorized and paying him royalties.|$|E
5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place {{under the supervision of}} German officials, who did not intervene.|$|E

Guy's army left the springs of Sepphora, and marched into the desert to give pitched battle. Stationary, it was surrounded and cut off from a supply of water, and on July 4 the army of Jerusalem was completely destroyed at the Battle of Hattin. Guy {{was one of the}} very few captives spared by the Saracens after the battle, along with his brother Geoffrey, Raynald, and Humphrey.|$|E

25|$|Following the Bridgman anvil, {{the diamond}} anvil cell {{became the most}} {{versatile}} pressure generating device that has a single characteristic that sets it apart from the other pressure devices. This provided the early high pressure pioneers with the capability to directly observe the properties of a material while under pressure. With just {{the use of an}} optical microscope, phase boundaries, color changes and recrystallization could be seen immediately, while x-ray diffraction or spectroscopy required time to expose and develop photographic film. The potential for the diamond anvil cell was realized by Alvin Van Valkenburg while he was preparing a sample for IR spectroscopy and <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> the alignment of the diamond faces.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> the license plate of the automobile a few moments later when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{his style}} of {{scouting}} {{was used as a}} blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as ability to hit, size, speed, and human power, saying that [...] "any dope" [...] could see it. When he scouted a prospect, his top priority <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> that the subject could handle the pressure of playing Major League Baseball. When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family. He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their farm teams to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams. He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with Tony Lazzeri, who was a poor fielder. Krichell also {{was one of the first}} to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.|$|E

500|$|One day, Lazzara <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> his emails and saw {{the phrase}} [...] "Best Places to Be a Mom" [...] roll across the news ticker. He thought it was [...] "funny and in context it is". The track {{started out as a}} slow song before being sped up by Reyes.

John's guitar playing, especially coupled with Eddie 's." [...] Lazzara said, [...] "Money (Let It Go)" [...] has a James Bond [...] "kind of spy/surf-y vibe" [...] and features a [...] "really cool surf-y solo" [...] by Nolan. O'Connell created the chord progression for [...] "This Is All Now", while Nolan came up with the melody for the song's chorus. The track's lyrics went through three or four different drafts. Lazzara said it was about the group's relationship with [...] "faith and growing up {{in and out of the}} church". The band referred to the bridge in [...] "Since You're Gone" [...] as the [...] "Beatles bridge" [...] because it was [...] "very unlike us," [...] according to Lazzara. Lazzara described [...] "Call Me in the Morning" [...] a [...] "ballady kind of sentimental tune". When the group recorded the track, they sat in a circle [...] "with this crazy microphone in the middle and we were all playing together". [...] "You Were Right" [...] started as an acoustic song, written by Nolan.|$|E
500|$|Later in the [...] "green reality", Michael {{suggests}} they check cheap motels in the area, since Gemini set up base a couple {{miles from the}} sites of his murders. Later, Michael talks to the manager at one hotel. After he leaves the hotel, Michael sees a secret place closed and Michael breaks in, drawing his gun. He spots the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] inside, but he ran away when Michael identified himself as a police officer. Soon after, the CSI team investigates, and Harper and Santoro wonder why Michael was there. He says that he <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> out motels and thought the building looked suspicious, and Santoro claimed that Michael is a [...] "suspect". They are unaware that the killer is listening to them from a nearby vent. Michael leaves the investigation, and as he goes to his car, the killer is seen dressed in a police uniform, as he is starting at him. Later at the station, Harper tells him that they {{got a call from}} someone claiming to be their guy. She plays a recording and Gemini addresses Michael as his friend. Harper tells Michael that they traced the call to his home phone. Later, Michael meets with Bird and the two find out that the killer was going to eject and then murder Agent Santoro. Later, the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] begins to cut the FBI agent's wrist. Minutes later, Michael and Bird try to find the killer, and the agent. They find her and she is taken to the hospital. Her family comes and sees her. Later, Michael tells Hannah what he's learned about the movers and Oregon. She shares her secrets, claimed that she was [...] "embarrassed", and they talk.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 February 1992, the American attack {{submarine}} [...] {{collided with the}} Russian Navy nuclear submarine B-276 Kostroma off Severomorsk.

Coming behind Harvick, Chase driver Matt Kenseth came in harder than the rest, and wrecked Harvick. [...] Harvick later {{returned}} to the race but 42 laps down. Later during the race, he saw Kenseth approaching him in his mirror and purposely applied his brakes, trying to knock Kenseth's radiator out as retaliation for the earlier incident. Harvick finished 33rd, while Kenseth earned a solid 6th-place finish. Harvick told reporters that if he does not advance to the next round of the Chase, he would make sure Kenseth wouldn't make it to the Championship round at Homestead. [...] This was the second time in 3-weeks that Kenseth was the center of attention, as he had physically attacked Brad Keselowski after a race at Charlotte two weeks prior to the incident with Harvick.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled culpable homicide. Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to James Grauerholz, two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> {{to see if it was}} loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story. Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel Queer while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs's attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to Ted Morgan, to [...] "skip" [...] and return to the United States. He was convicted in absentia of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Bartlett Richards bought 20,000 head {{of cattle}} from Mexico and in November of that year a very strong snow storm {{incapacitated}} the area. [...] "The Spade lost 10,000 of those cattle," [...] Lawrence said, [...] "and there was a pile of hides in Ellsworth {{as high as the}} depot." [...] Lawrence and his brother Ona skinned cattle for 50 cents a head, 25 cents per calf and everyday the intense cold brought more losses to the Spade. When Lawrence was old enough to file on a homestead, he described his land on the Alkali Lake Meadow as a quarter-mile deep and two miles wide, but he met requirements and received patent on the string of 40's in 1918. In 1925 Brass and Meyers arranged with Lawrence to buy the hay and have him care for and feed their cattle which were branded with Sandhills Land and Cattle Company's Sugar Bowl brand. Early on, Brass assisted Bixby with a $2,000.00 ($24,031.37 current) down payment on a loan to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) of the Spade land. [...] Beginning in 1925, Bixby slowly began to obtain sections of the old Spade Ranch range by hard work and perseverance, aided by bankers willing to take a chance. In 1926, Brass and Meyers suggested Bixby move to the ranch headquarters in the Spade home valley. The same year Lawrence was asked by the Union Pacific assistant treasurer C.T. Cullen for permission to bring a hunting party to the Spade and {{for a number of years}} the men came in a private railroad car, bringing their own cook and paid handsomely for hunting rights on Bixby land and lakes. Mr. Cullen dropped by the day Lawrence <b>was</b> <b>checking</b> applications for the district school, where he was a board member. [...] "Hire this one with the Irish eyes," [...] Mr. Cullen suggested and in time Miss Eleanor Riordan of York, Nebraska began teaching Cherry County District #168. Lawrence conscientiously kept in touch with the young teacher and the day after her term ended they were married in Alliance, Nebraska on May 26, 1927.|$|E
