25|$|<b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> come {{to settle}} here. We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
2500|$|David Foster said, [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{in shock}} and truly devastated. Donna {{changed the face of}} pop culture forever. There is no doubt that music would sound {{different}} today if she had never graced us with her talent. She was a super-diva and a true superstar who never compromised when it came to her career or her family. She always did it with class, dignity, grace and zero attitude. She lived in rare air ... She was the most spectacular, considerate, constant, giving, generous and loving friend of 35 years. I am at a total loss trying to process this tragic news." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Sposa son disprezzata" [...] ("I <b>am</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> scorned") is an Italian aria {{written by}} Geminiano Giacomelli. It {{is used in}} Vivaldi's pasticcio, Bajazet.|$|R

5000|$|My <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a British {{television}} comedy which {{aired on}} ITV in 1958. It {{was produced by}} Associated-Rediffusion Television. It starred Mai Zetterling, Rex Garner and Joan Benham.|$|R

6000|$|I:2:52 [...] ALAR. [...] In truth, good sirs, [...] My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{somewhat}} strangers here, [...] And {{things that}} are of moment to the minds [...] That long have dwelt on them, to us are nought.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Dear Theodora,--You judged rightly that I am no man to trifle, or {{to raise}} {{expectations}} which I {{did not mean}} to fulfil. My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> at Matlock for a few days before joining at Winchester.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you safe, Mr. Jervoise," [...] a man said. [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{beginning}} to be anxious, fearing that you might have fallen into the hands of your enemies." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the last}} {{occasion}} when I made a lengthened stay in London, my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> surprised <b>and</b> amused one morning by {{the receipt of}} the following note, addressed {{to me in a}} small, crabbed, foreign-looking handwriting.|$|R
60|$|We {{are delighted}} to be remembered by your charming <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{entrusted}} with more messages from this house to her, than you would care to give or withhold, so I suppress them myself and absolve you from the difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not," [...] he agreed. [...] "It is {{probably}} no secret {{to you that}} my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> temporarily estranged," [...] he continued. [...] "The chief reason for that estrangement is that I forbade her your house or your acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{obliged to}} go post-haste to Italy. I watched you {{both at the}} dance the other night. Be very gentle with Nell; and--good luck to you! But don't say again that I told you to be patient; it is hardly the way to make her love you.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Archibald had a {{very sharp}} sense of the humorous, and in his {{enjoyment}} of a comical situation he liked company. His heart was stirred to put his expedition in its true light before this man who was so honest and plain-spoken. [...] "Mr. Sadler," [...] said he, [...] "if you will {{take it as a}} piece of confidential information, and not intended for the general ear, I will tell you what sort of a holiday my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> taking. We are on a wedding-journey." [...] And then he told the story of the proxy bridal tour.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{about to}} turn to our guide, when the woman raised her head a little, so that her face <b>was</b> exposed. <b>I</b> at once {{recognised}} the features of Njamie, Mbango's favourite <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> now at no loss to divine the cause of her grief.|$|R
5000|$|The song played {{during the}} final montage/closing credits is the aria [...] "Sposa son disprezzata" [...] ("I <b>am</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> scorned") from the opera Bajazet by Antonio Vivaldi, sung by Cecilia Bartoli. This is the same music that opens the next episode, [...] "Amour Fou".|$|R
6000|$|My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> both so fond {{of country}} life and country pursuits that month after month passed by at our little farm in a {{succession}} of delightful days. Time flew like a [...] "limited express" [...] train, and it was September before we knew it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is why I am here,' {{said the}} father quickly. 'My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> loth to trouble you. But the poor little thing has worked {{herself into a}} {{paroxysm}} of fright and is calling for you. We have {{tried in vain to}} comfort or reassure her. She will not be satisfied without you. She keeps calling on [...] "The Man" [...] to come and help her. I am loth to put you to further strain after all you have gone through to-day; but if you would come--' Harold was already in the passage as he spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> Americans, and at {{the time}} of this story were middle-aged people and very fond of seeing in each other's company {{whatever}} there was of interest or beauty around us. We had a son about twenty-two years old, of whom we were also very fond; but he was not with us, being at that time a student in Germany. Although we had good health, we were not very robust people, and, under ordinary circumstances, not much given to long country tramps. I was of medium size, without much muscular development, while my wife was quite stout, and growing stouter.|$|E
60|$|My {{ideas are}} cramped, you say?--Oh, I {{forgot to tell}} you that this home I am {{describing}} is to be a floating home, and that my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> to journey around the world in it for the matter of seven years or more. I forgot also to state that there will be an engine-room in it for a seventy-horse-power engine, a dynamo, storage batteries, etc.; tanks for water to last long weeks at sea; space for fifteen hundred gallons of gasolene, fire extinguishers, and life-preservers; and a great store-room for food, spare sails, anchors, hawsers, tackles, and a thousand and one other things.|$|E
60|$|About noon on the {{following}} day, when my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> laughing <b>and</b> arguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishment--so soon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy, of a sudden I saw her face change, and asked what was the matter.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{terrified of}} losing him, Sofia Kolchak (Anna Kovalchuk) offers {{to leave for}} Petrograd and let her husband be with Anna if he so desires. The Admiral, however, firmly tells her, [...] "You <b>are</b> my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> your husband. That is how it always shall be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not fit to <b>be</b> his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not. Nothing is changed in all that. But when I {{heard that he}} was--. But, father, we will not talk of it now. How good you have <b>been</b> to me, <b>I</b> shall never forget,--and how tender!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, monsieur; but my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> glad to {{see that}} it is otherwise, and that, after all you have risked for that pretty creature, {{you are going to be}} happy together. My wife was not surprised. Women are sharper than men in these matters, and she said to me, when she heard what you were going to do to save them, 'I would wager, Pierre, that one of these mesdemoiselles is not monsieur's sister. Men will do a great deal for their sister, but I never heard of a man {{throwing}} away his life as he is going to do on the mere chance of saving one.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt lay abed at his hotel, {{imagining the}} Zenith Athletic Club asking him, [...] "What {{kind of a}} time d'you have in Chicago?" [...] and his answering, [...] "Oh, fair; ran around with Sir Gerald Doak a lot;" [...] picturing himself meeting Lucile McKelvey and admonishing her, [...] "You're all right, Mrs. Mac, when you aren't trying to pull this highbrow pose. It's just as Gerald Doak says to me in Chicago--oh, yes, Jerry's {{an old friend of}} mine--the <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of running over to England to stay with Jerry in his castle, next year--and he said to me, 'Georgie, old bean, I like Lucile first-rate, but you and me, George, we got to make her get over this highty-tighty hooptediddle way she's got." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Unless you are braver {{than almost}} any one has ever been. They don't often put people to sleep there, but {{sometimes}} the house is so crowded that they have to. The same thing always happens--ill-concealed agitation at the breakfast-table and letters of the greatest importance. Of course it's a bachelor's room, and my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{at the other end}} of the house. But we saw the comedy three days ago--the day after we got here. A young fellow had been put there--I forget his name--the house was so full; and the usual consequence followed. Letters at breakfast--an awfully queer face--an urgent call to town--so very sorry his visit was cut short. Ashmore and his wife looked at each other, and off the poor devil went.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The husband hesitated, as if {{he found}} the {{explanation}} somewhat difficult. 'Oh,' he answered carelessly, 'the <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> chaffing, <b>and</b> she said she'd often seen you jump it, and'--he laughed a rather forced laugh--'she promised me a--a kiss if I cleared it. It was a foolish thing to do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> in earnest. <b>I</b> want a <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to}} have one. You two will stay up there, and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me. You can settle it between yourselves, {{and let me know}} when you have come to a decision." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Adam Friedman, [...] "Filming ‘Shout’ was an {{extraordinary}} experience. My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> stopped at gunpoint in Malawi and {{were one of the}} last film crews shooting in Sierra Leone as the Ebola plague descended. But throughout, the wonderful people of Africa and the amazing work that Ann’s groups were doing inspired us to keep on keeping on.” ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR COGGIE,--We {{are very}} much distressed to hear of this which has befallen your family. As for Sir Alexander, I can but speak from my own feelings: he survived to finish his book and to conduct, with such a great success, the tercentenary. Ah, how many die just upon the threshold! Had he died a year ago, how great a disappointment! But all this is nothing to the survivors. Do please, {{as soon as you}} are able, let us know how it goes and how it is likely to go with the family; and believe that both my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> most anxious to have good news, or the best possible. My poor Coggie, I know very well how you must feel; you are passing a bad time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{write to}} you, dear sir, at my brother's request. My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{doing all that}} we can to relieve and comfort him, but his mind has not yet {{sufficiently}} recovered to enable him to write to you himself. He desires to thank you heartily for your sympathy, at the most trying period of his life; and he trusts to your kindness to let him hear, from time to time, of Mr. Keller's progress towards recovery, and of {{the well-being of the}} business. In addressing your letters to me at Bingen, you will be pleased to consider the information of my brother's whereabouts herein afforded to you as strictly confidential, until you hear from me to the contrary. In his present frame of mind, {{it would be in the}} last degree painful to him to be made the subject of inquiries, remonstrances, or entreaties to return." ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR CUMMY,--My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> {{very much}} vexed {{to hear you}} are still unwell. We are both keeping far better; she {{especially}} seems quite to have taken a turn--the turn, we shall hope. Please let us know how you get on, and {{what has been the}} matter with you; Braemar I believe--the vile hole. You know what a lazy rascal I am, so you won't be surprised at a short letter, I know; indeed, you will be much more surprised at my having had the decency to write at all. We have got rid of our young, pretty, and incompetent maid; and now we have a fine, canny, twinkling, shrewd, auld-farrant peasant body, who gives us good food and keeps us in good spirits. If we could only understand what she says! But she speaks Davos language, which is to German what Aberdeen-awa' is to English, so it comes heavy. God bless you, my dear Cummy; and so says Fanny forbye.--Ever your affectionate, ...|$|E
60|$|By the {{afternoon}} of the next day the abodes of those two most energetic and capable housewives, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, were fully prepared for the reception of their visitors, and the Dusante family were ensconced beneath the roof of the one, while my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> most warmly welcomed at the gaily adorned door of the other.|$|R

6000|$|Sir Percival was as silent {{at breakfast}} {{as he had}} been the evening before, {{on the subject of the}} mysterious [...] "arrangement" [...] (as the lawyer called it) which is hanging over our heads.
