5|$|Further details, {{including}} {{the matter of}} Sinar Harapan share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition— totalling eight pages— was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in Kompas former laundry room, a one story warehouse; the first employees {{had to do the}} layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During the first few months, the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the editors at first did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the censorship of Suharto's New Order government.|$|E
5|$|General Carleton {{arrived in}} Trois-Rivières {{late in the}} action. A {{detachment}} of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière-du-Loup, a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence. Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw, allowing most of the Americans to escape, either because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further. A significant number of Americans did not make it that far, and were captured. These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers. It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers. In all, 236 captives were taken. Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle, while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed.|$|E
5|$|In either late-1938 or early-1939 Lutteroth and EMLL {{declared}} that Gus Kallio, due to holding the National Wrestling Association World Middleweight Championship was also {{recognized as the}} World Middleweight Champion in Mexico. On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the internal politics of the NWA at the time. While they left the NWA they kept promoting the NWA World Middleweight Championship {{as well as the}} NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship that they had controlled for years.|$|E

25|$|Although Jung enlisted {{himself in}} the Canadian Army back in 1939, he did not receive his first {{assignment}} until 1944, mainly because politicians in Ottawa and Victoria did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the issues of enfranchising the Chinese after the war. However, Winston Churchill's wartime Special Operations Executive recruited Jung {{and a group of}} Chinese-Canadian soldiers who were sent to British Malaya to train local guerillas to resist the Japanese Imperial Army occupying Malaya and Singapore. The mission for the Asian Canadian soldiers was known as Operation Oblivion. However, the operation came to an abrupt cancellation, allowing Jung to lead his troops through China in their own search and rescue missions.|$|E

The following week he was quoted as saying: [...] "There were times in the past few months in which I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix."

500|$|Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane {{returned}} to New York {{to preside over}} hearings (begun on the Commission's own initiative) into oil pipelines. [...] While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company, he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who, though secretary of several pipeline companies, could not say who authorized the sales. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> a clerk or one of your $5,000 a year men. I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority." [...] The Commission held that oil pipelines were common carriers, and ordered the companies owning them to file rate schedules and otherwise comply with the Interstate Commerce Act.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen's July 2009 {{review for}} The A.V. Club in July 2009 gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen's least {{favorite}} part of the episode, and with the exception of that character, {{it was one of the}} better scripts seen in The Original Series. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying [...] "The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with,</b> and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock." ...|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars {{in front of the}} camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E

2500|$|After Michael Sam, an {{openly gay}} player, {{was drafted by}} the St. Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL Draft, Dungy said would not have drafted Sam, saying [...] "Not because I don’t believe Michael Sam should {{have a chance to}} play, but I wouldn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> all of it." [...] The comment drew {{criticism}} from some who viewed it as homophobic. Following a backlash, Dungy subsequently clarified his remarks, saying that he gave an [...] "honest answer" [...] to a question and that his concern would be with media coverage over Sam if he were the player's coach. Dungy has also expressed opposition to same-sex marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Clapton {{was pleased}} with the jam sessions, but was {{hesitant}} to start a serious group. Ginger Baker turned up again one day to sit in with them in 1969, and the band took near-final form. Clapton questioned letting Baker in the band, because he had promised Jack Bruce that, if they were to work with one another again, all three of them would play. Moreover, Clapton didn't want to reunite with Cream barely nine weeks after the break-up, and also didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> another [...] "Cream-like" [...] super-stardom situation. Winwood ultimately persuaded Clapton to finalize Baker's inclusion in the line-up, arguing that Ginger Baker strengthened their musicianship {{and that it would be}} hard to find an equally talented drummer.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, both David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A" [...] grade. Sims (writing {{for people who}} have not read the novels) {{expressed}} shock at the deaths of several main characters, writing, [...] "I don’t think I’ve really processed what I just watched". VanDerWerff, who reviews the episodes {{for people who have}} read the novels, wrote [...] "If [...] doesn’t terribly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the thought of the deaths of Catelyn and Robb, well, he or she can read that much more quickly. Or he or she can read that much more slowly if there’s a need to process the emotions more fully. On TV, you can't really do that." [...] Reviewing for Forbes, Erik Kain called the episode [...] "one of the best episodes of HBO's dark drama yet", and noted [...] "there was a deeper sense of tragedy knowing [...] also lost his unborn child". Sean Collins of the Rolling Stone also praised the episode, and commented on the unusual step the show took in ending one of its central conflicts. Sarah Hughes of The Guardian highlighted the decision to kill Talisa, writing that her [...] "heartbreaking end was unbearable".|$|E
