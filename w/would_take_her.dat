5|$|LeToya Luckett and Roberson became {{unhappy with}} Mathew's {{managing}} {{of the band}} and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause. Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time. The depression was so severe it lasted {{for a couple of}} years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Beyoncé stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award and she feared no one <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> seriously. Beyoncé would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it. Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyoncé, Rowland, and Williams.|$|E
5|$|While {{being interviewed}} by author Wilbur Siebert in 1897, Tubman named {{some of the}} people who helped her and places that she stayed along the Underground Railroad. She stayed with Sam Green, a free black {{minister}} living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents' home at Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland. She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington. In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to William Still's office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area. Still, a famous black agent, is credited with aiding hundreds of freedom seekers escape to safer places farther north in New York, New England, and present-day Southern Ontario.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|Holly {{runs away}} from home and a {{large-scale}} police investigation is put in place to find her. Many other residents in the village suspect Loretta's boyfriend Jake of being her kidnapper, unaware that she is safe and hiding in Darren's flat. Loretta leaves Jake after she begins to doubt his innocence but later reconciles with him. After Jake finds Holly he chases her, she falls over and takes a blow to the head and falls into a coma. Initially the police suspect that Jake was behind this but later release him. Loretta once more begins to doubt him. Upset, Jake goes to stay with his old friend Caroline (Amber Hodgkiss). After sleeping with him Caroline drugs him, ties him up, tries to kill him, and holds him hostage for a few days. She is angered to learn he is going out with Loretta and sets out to try to kill Holly but Loretta is there by Holly's bedside. Caroline tries to attack Loretta with a syringe needle but Jake saves Loretta and, in the process, Caroline is stabbed with the needle. After the ordeal Loretta disappears, having {{to accept the fact that}} Jake had cheated on her much to his dismay. She returns but while she was away Loretta had become involved with a realtor called Adam. At first Jake thought she was looking for a home. However, when he saw them both arguing, Jake realises something was not as it seemed. When Jake confronts Loretta she tells him that Adam was harassing her. This leads to Jake confronting Adam and warning him to stay away from Loretta. However Adam tells him that Loretta had been controlling his life and that she wants to be with him. Adam explains that Loretta had told him about Jake and that he was the biggest mistake of her life in the hope that Adam <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E

25|$|Hopestar {{was then}} out of service for three months, departing from the Belfast Lough on 25 March 1941 for the River Tyne, where she arrived on 1 April. She was {{then out of}} service until 2 August when she sailed from Sunderland, County Durham on a voyage that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to Freetown, Cape Town, Durban, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Alexandria, Beirut and Haifa, which was reached on 20 December. Hopestar {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Port Said, Suez, Aden, Mauritius, Durban and Freetown. She arrived at Southend-on-Sea on 20 April 1942. She sailed a week later on a voyage that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to New York, Key West, Trinidad, Cape Town, Durban and Bombay, India, where she arrived on 28 October 1942.|$|E
25|$|DeLorean's mother, Kathryn, was an Austrian {{immigrant}} from Austria-Hungary. She was employed at the Carboloy Products Division of General Electric {{throughout much of}} DeLorean's early life. She took work where ever she could to supplement the family's income. She generally tolerated her husband's erratic behavior, but during several of the worst times of Zachary's violent tendencies, she <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> sons {{to live with her}} sister in Los Angeles, California, where they would stay for a year or so at a time.|$|E
25|$|The Scott Tournament of Hearts {{would last}} 25 years, {{and saw the}} likes of many great teams. The first Tournament of Hearts was won by Colleen Jones and her Nova Scotia team. It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> 17 years to win another, but she would cap it off with another four championships for {{a grand total of}} six championships. Other great curlers at the Hearts have been Connie Laliberte and Jennifer Jones of Manitoba, Heather Houston, Marilyn Bodogh and Rachel Homan of Ontario, Vera Pezer and Sandra Schmirler of Saskatchewan, Cathy Borst, Shannon Kleibrink and Valerie Sweeting of Alberta and Lindsay Sparkes and Kelly Scott of British Columbia.|$|E

60|$|Nanina debated {{with herself}} {{for a moment}} whether she should answer the letter in the hardest way, to her, by writing, or, in the easiest way, in person; and decided on going to the studio and telling the master-sculptor {{that it would be}} {{impossible}} for her to serve him as a model, at least for some time to come. It <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> a long hour to say this with due propriety on paper; it <b>would</b> only <b>take</b> <b>her</b> a few minutes to say it with her own lips.

25|$|One famous bakeneko {{story is}} about a man named Takasu Genbei, whose mother’s {{personality}} changed completely after his pet cat went missing for many years. His mother avoided the company {{of friends and family}} and <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> meals alone in her room. When the family peeked in on her, they saw a cat-like monster in the mother's clothes, chewing on animal carcasses. Takasu, still skeptical, slew what looked like his mother, and after one day his mother's body turned back into his pet cat that had been missing. Takasu then tore up the floorboards of his mother's room to find her skeleton hidden there, her bones gnawed clean of all flesh.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} her father in January 1852 {{prompted}} her to relocate to Guayaquil where she lived with prominent nobles and {{it was here that}} she began her mission of helping the poor and the sick and caring for abandoned children. It was also here that she {{took a job as a}} seamstress in order to fund her mission as well as supporting her eight brothers and sisters. But she soon moved to Cuenca for some months where she went from home to home and lived with whoever <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> in including Blessed Mercedes de Jesús Molina to allow herself greater time for silent contemplation and penance. In 1865 her spiritual director fell ill and died in 1868 which was at the time the local bishop invited her to live with the Carmelites even though she had refused the offer.|$|E
25|$|Sir Charles Deedes later (in September 1968) {{wrote that}} Wilson’s energy and {{foresight}} in 1910–14 had ensured that Britain <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> place alongside France when war came. An alternative view, aired {{as early as}} the 1920s, is that Wilson locked Britain into a continental commitment which Kitchener would rather have avoided or minimised. Jeffrey is critical of some historians – e.g. Zara Steiner in Britain and the Origins of the First World War, Gerhard Ritter in The Sword and the Sceptre – who take an oversimplified view of Wilson as a supporter of the French position. Although Wilson’s verbal fluency and charm brought him great influence, his position was also supported by most of his military colleagues and by the most influential members of the Cabinet. Furthermore, this ignores Wilson’s interest in reaching a military agreement with Belgium.|$|E

25|$|On 30 July 1808 Meleager, {{under the}} command of Captain Frederick Warren, had been sailing from Port Royal, Jamaica, when in the evening the master, believing that land in sight was Portland Point, set a course that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> well clear of land. Still, less than half an hour later lookouts spotted broken water ahead; {{although}} the helmsman attempted to turn Meleager, she struck. Efforts to get her off or to stem in the inflow of water were unsuccessful. During the night the crew took down the masts and made rafts; once daylight arrived the task became to get everyone safely on shore. A line was strung to the shore of Bare Bush Key and all but three crewmen made it safely ashore. For the next few days the crew worked to salvage a large amount of stores and the guns.|$|E
25|$|Sauvé {{was born}} in the Fransaskois {{community}} of Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, to Charles Albert Benoît and Anna Vaillant, and three years later moved with them to Ottawa, where her family had previously lived. In Ottawa, her father <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to see the bronze bust on Parliament Hill of Canada's first female Member of Parliament (MP), Agnes Macphail. Sauvé studied at Notre Dame du Rosaire Convent in Ottawa, becoming head of her class in her first year, and continued her education at the University of Ottawa, working for the government of Canada as a translator in order to pay her tuition. At the same time, Sauvé actively involved herself in student and political affairs; at the age of 20, she became the national president of the Young Catholic Students Group, which employed her in 1942, necessitating her move to Montreal.|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 1804 Raven sailed from Malta as escort to the {{merchant}} ship Dolphin, bound for Naples. She was following a course {{along the south}} coast of Sicily that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> between the islands of Favignana and Marettimo. In {{the evening of the}} next day master's mate Robert Incledon had the watch and saw a light shape in the moonless night. He thought it was a sail {{but it turned out to}} be a tower on the cliffs near Mazari, on the south west coast of Sicily. At 11pm she ran aground. Despite efforts to lighten and free her, efforts that extended into the afternoon of 6 January, the pumps were unable to clear the water that was coming in and she had to be abandoned. Dolphin rescued her crew. The court martial on 10 February 1805 admonished the master for having steered too near the land.|$|E

25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

When the church was closed, the records were moved to the nearby St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. Davis Coakley {{references}} a second baptism by a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother circa 1859. According to Fox's own testimony written by him years later in Donahoe's Magazine in 1905, Jane Wilde would visit his chapel in Glencree, County Wicklow for Mass and <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> sons with her. She then asked Father Fox to baptise her sons.|$|E
500|$|The only {{feasible}} option James {{had for a}} girls league was at Annunciation, a Catholic {{organization in}} the Don Mills district. Lacking a vehicle {{to drive to the}} games, her mother <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to and from games at various rinks via the bus. [...] The girls' hockey program was small, requiring that teams be made up of players from all age groups in order to field complete rosters. Skipping the bantam age group entirely, James first played senior hockey with the Newtonbrook Saints. She was 13 at the time, playing against women 16 and older. The Saints were a Senior C team, the fourth highest level of women's hockey in the Toronto area at the time.|$|E
