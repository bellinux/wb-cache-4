500|$|In 2008, former {{baseball}} players' union chief Marvin Miller, {{trying to}} defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against claims {{that he should not}} be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, [...] "Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> by and large, the players, and certainly the ones I knew, are good people. But the Hall is full of villains." [...] Miller's comment about Anson has no basis, other than speculating that he could have been a Klansman since he was a racist during his playing career, which ended in 1897, although he was umpiring games with black players by 1901, including featuring the all-black Columbia Giants. [...] Miller, age 91 at the time the 2008 article appeared, is the earliest source for declaring that it is factual that Anson {{was a member of the}} Klan, based purely on an Internet search of sources that try to link Anson to the Klan. [...] By contrast, Speaker-Cobb-Rogers Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring to the 1920s (Anson died in 1922), “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, it’s possible that they [...] were briefly in the Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. [...] The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided they were native born, Protestant and white.” ...|$|E
2500|$|James S. Ketchum, {{a retired}} psychiatrist, {{veteran of the}} former U.S. {{chemical}} warfare program, and advocate of chemical warfare, believes that people who fear chemical agents more than bullets and bombs are irrational. He cited the Russian government actions approvingly: [...] "It’s been looked at by some skeptics {{as a kind of}} tragedy...They say, ‘Look, a hundred and thirty people died.’ <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a hundred and thirty is better than eight hundred, and it’s also better, as a secondary consideration, not to have to blow up a beautiful theatre." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ellams nodded. [...] "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was, so to speak, a {{personal}} thing.

6000|$|... "For a man working upon such slight data as {{he himself}} confesses," [...] was the quiet comment, [...] "he is damnably accurate. It is as <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> this did not reach Marshal Massena." ...|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have.

6000|$|... "And so, {{for fear}} you should lose it, {{you did not}} strike the spark? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was wise. It would {{certainly}} have cost you one thing which you seem to value," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "You always are," [...] remarked Bickley; [...] "even {{when most}} people's appetites {{might have been}} affected. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this great plateau was once a landing-place for flying machines, {{and that there is}} the air-shed or garage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it {{will make}} any difference, for the rope {{is strong enough to}} hold the three of us together. However, here goes. We may as well leave our coatees behind us. They might get us into difficulties, if we took them." ...|$|R

"Well, I suppose I may {{venture that}} far, after having {{participated in the}} {{shooting}} of the Hoxie <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this place is safe for you any longer, and if I {{was a member of}} this firm, I should move everything from here as soon as possible." ...|$|R
60|$|And criticism--what {{place is}} that to have in our culture? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times, and upon all subjects: C'est une grande avantage de n'avoir rien fait, mais il ne faut pas en abuser.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is so much}} better," [...] Helen agreed. [...] "Try as hard as ever I can, I cannot picture {{his doing}} any harm to anybody.

Your two pounds of powder won't make many of them--not above two fair-sized ones, and the betting is they would not go up." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 9 January 2013, a {{video of}} Mac Grianna {{surfaced}} on YouTube showing him being caught unaware whilst applying some make-up to {{his face as he}} prepared for a live bulletin on RTÉ's digital news channel News Now. The presenter did not realise the cameras were rolling after a technical error meant that footage of Mac Grianna readying himself for the broadcast was shown instead of the title sequence. The incident quickly became an internet sensation with over one million YouTube hits in the first couple of days. Aengus commented on it by saying [...] ".. I saw the fun in it. You have to laugh at yourself as <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> important." [...] Prior to this incident, Mac Grianna has had several previous incidents on air.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a very valid {{point and}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's a {{reflection}} of, not necessarily this programme but of television in general, {{that if you}} die and enough people are watching you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well known. So when you have these things like Columbine, and you have these kids who are angry and they {{have something to say}} and no one's listening, the media sends a message that says if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time magazine twice, the media gave them exactly what they wanted. That's why I never did any interviews around that time when I was being blamed for it because I didn't want to contribute to something that I found to be reprehensible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but he wouldn't care if I were cultivated, Ha is {{like all}} the rest. He would like to joke and laugh. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is nice, too, and I wish I could do it. But I never could, and now I can't try. I suppose he wonders what makes me such a dead weight on you all." ...|$|E
60|$|The President: <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{that will}} do. The Court is {{necessarily}} adverse to allowing {{the presumption of}} death, except on evidence of the most satisfactory nature. Still, considering that nearly four months have now passed since the foundering of the Kangaroo under circumstances which make it exceedingly improbable that there were any other survivors, I think that it may fairly presume that Mr. Meeson shared {{the fate of the}} other passengers.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have just}} arrived, sir; {{we are a}} section of the Maritzburg Scouts, acting independently. As we are all from Johannesburg, and find our own horses, equipment, and food, provide our own rations, and, of course, serve without pay, we propose to scout on our own account, and as we all speak Dutch <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we may be useful in obtaining information. We shall, of course, search the country in {{whatever}} direction may be considered most useful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A clumsy effort that, of course," [...] he admitted, [...] "especially {{when your}} father has a detective always round the place. He is <b>well</b> guarded, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you could {{do better than that}} if you would, Miss Duge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Vengeance is mine. I will repay,' saith the Lord," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crawley. [...] "We may safely {{leave all}} that alone, and rid our minds of such wishes, if it be possible. It is <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> violent offences, when committed, should {{be met by}} instant rebuke. To turn the other cheek instantly to the smiter can hardly be suitable in these days, when the hands of so many are raised to strike. But the return blow should be given only while the smart remains. She hurt me then; {{but what is it}} to me now, that she called me a thief to my face? Do I not know that, all the country round, men and women are calling me the same behind my back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you this now and for always," [...] she continued. [...] "I have nothing to give you. What you ask for is just as {{impossible}} as though you were to walk in your picture gallery and kneel before your great masterpiece and beg Beatrice herself to step down from the canvas. I began to wonder yesterday," [...] she went on, rising abruptly and moving across the room, [...] "whether I really was that sort of woman. With your money in my pocket and the gambling fever in my pulses, I began even to believe it. And now I know that I am not. Good-bye, Mr. Draconmeyer. I don't blame you. On the whole, perhaps, you have behaved quite <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you have chosen to behave well because that wonderful brain of yours told you that it gave you the best chance. That doesn't really matter, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|Atene {{listened and}} for a while stood silent, perhaps because she had no answer. Then she said with a little laugh--"Is that your will? <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> yonder are none whom you would wish to wed. There is fire and to spare, but no lovely, shameless spirit haunts it to drive men mad with evil longings;" [...] and as though at some secret thought, a spasm of pain crossed her face and caught her breath. Then she went on in the same cold voice--"Wanderers, this land has its secrets, into which no {{foreigner}} must pry. I say to you yet again that while I live you set no foot upon that Mountain. Know also, Leo Vincey, I have bared my heart to you, and I have been told in answer that this long quest of yours is not for me, as I was sure in my folly, but, as I think, for some demon wearing the shape of woman, whom you will never find. Now I make no prayer to you; it is not fitting, but you have learned too much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>well!</b> <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you was {{a gentleman}} that would not go back from your word. <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you would never put a young lady to the {{necessity}} of bringing forward her own letters to prove {{that she is not}} expecting more than she has a right! You don't know! And that, after all that has been between us! John Eames!" [...] And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.|$|R
2500|$|Matthews {{relieved}} Denfeld {{as chief}} of naval operations after hearing Denfeld's testimony, which contradicted the official positions of the civilian Defense Department leadership. Other Navy officers {{who participated in the}} controversy also saw their careers stalled or ended, but Griffin emerged unscathed. [...] "The other people involved in it didn't all get hurt. I didn't get hurt and it was <b>well</b> known, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had a lot to do}} with writing that statement." ...|$|R
