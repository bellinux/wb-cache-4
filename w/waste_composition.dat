50|$|Under normal {{operation}} conditions, mobile incinerators are consistently {{able to keep}} emissions well below respective limits, for example in accordance to the German TA-Luft regulation. Often, emissions are well below the limits. This applies especially to the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and furans (dioxins and furans). In spite of sophisticated technology, it may happen that higher emission values are reached due to inhomogeneous fuel (<b>waste</b> <b>composition),</b> especially in the phases of start up, shut down and malfunction of a plant.|$|E

Chris Walsh joined the team and between 2001 and 2003 the group secured several hundred thousand pounds through grants and loans, designed the site, obtaining planning permission and a waste management licence.|$|E
50|$|Naval vessels, cruise liners, and {{off-shore}} installations such as gas-drilling rigs and oil platforms {{are another}} logical application of converter technology. Due to the extended isolation periods of sea-going vessels and off-shore platforms {{there is an}} issue of how to store and dispose of refuse in an efficient and sanitary way. Worldwide legislation on sea dumping is strict and does not allow, under stringent penalties, any ships or sea vessels to dump waste, gray water, or even ballast water that has been collected in a remote geographic location due to the danger of biological contamination. Ship-generated waste is either held and disposed of in port waste disposal facilities or can be converted directly on the vessel for easier storage and at times (depending on <b>waste</b> <b>composition)</b> for additional fuel.|$|E
30|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} {{composition}} depends and varies {{on the basis}} of leachate composition, broadly on solid <b>wastes</b> <b>composition.</b> In Bangladesh, DOM removal facility is not properly installed in the landfill sites and metals binding capacity of leachate-derived DOM was not investigated yet which could be different from other international studies’ results depending on the <b>composition</b> of solid <b>waste</b> of the country. Hence, {{this study was designed to}} determine the physico-chemical and optical properties of leachate (DOM) and to evaluate the toxic metals (Ni 2 +, Pb 2 + and Hg 2 +) binding affinity of leachate-derived DOM. This research could be a promising work in the context of DOM–metal interactions in landfill leachate of Bangladesh.|$|R

Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a possible degradation mechanism of waste tank steels. Accelerated electrochemical tests were performed to identify potential ranges where SCC could occur for ASTM A 537 and A 285 plain carbon steels. The results showed that the only probable potential range for SCC would be that for the normal oxide state (- 0. 200 to - 0. 400 V). Possible oxide instability was also identified for the range of 0. 000 to 0. 200 V. These ranges will be used for the planned slow strain rate test to determine SCC susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{modifications}} to the ISS <b>waste</b> water <b>composition,</b> the concentration of volatile organics has significantly increased in the feed to the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). In parallel, the oxygen supply pressure increased, resulting in a higher flow rate of oxygen to the WPA. Preliminary testing at Hamilton Sund strand indicated that the higher oxygen flow rate would increase the WPA capacity for volatile organics. Following {{an analysis of the}} expected <b>waste</b> water <b>composition,</b> personnel at NASA MSFC and Hamilton Sundstrand conducted a test of a flight-like reactor to assess its capacity for the higher organic loads. The results of this test indicate the WPA can accommodate the expected organic load in the ISS waste water with margin...|$|R

40|$|The {{radioactive}} defense wastes {{stored in}} 177 underground single-shell tanks (SST) and double-shell tanks (DST) at the Hanford Site will be separated into low-level and high-level fractions. One technology activity underway at PNNL {{is the development}} of glass formulations for the immobilization of the low-level tank wastes. A glass formulation strategy has been developed that describes development approaches to optimize glass compositions prior to the projected LLW vitrification facility start-up in 2005. Implementation of this strategy requires testing of glass formulations spanning a number of <b>waste</b> loadings, <b>compositions,</b> and additives over the range of expected <b>waste</b> <b>compositions.</b> The resulting glasses will then be characterized and compared to processing and performance specifications yet to be developed. This report documents the glass formulation work conducted at PNL in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 including glass formulation optimization, minor component impacts evaluation, Phase 1 and Phase 2 melter vendor glass development, liquidus temperature and crystallization kinetics determination.

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{is about the}} investigation of the effects of landfill stability with relation to the solid <b>waste</b> <b>composition</b> in landfill site located in Selangor, Malaysia. The stability of a landfill relies on the shear strength of its elements and their settlement behaviour. Most of the landfill is made up of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), so the overall stability of the landfill slopes is governed by the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the MSW. The main objective of this {{research is}} to determine the relationship between solid <b>waste</b> <b>composition</b> and their mechanical properties in order to analyse the site stability. The workplan begin with the desk study and proceed with physical and chemical properties test followed by the implementation of details laboratory works for testing the mechanicals parameters. A landfill site has been selected and four samples location differred by age were chosen {{in order to have a}} clear view of the overall solid <b>waste</b> <b>composition</b> and the geotechnical condition of selected landfill site. Basic physical and chemical properties of MSW were carried out such as moisture content, specific gravity and organic content.

At the end of this study, several salient points have been concluded with respected to the solid <b>waste</b> <b>composition</b> and the site stability analysis...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulations}} of mixed waste processing flowsheets using ASPEN PLUS process simulation software were completed by a joint Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory/Los National Laboratory (LLNL/LANL) effort for the US Department of Energy Mixed Waste Treatment Project. The LLNL model used relatively detailed synthesized chemical ``cocktails`` to simulate waste streams. The LANL approach used less detail but made {{extensive use of}} simple steam splitters and thermodynamic coal models for combustible <b>waste</b> <b>compositions.</b> The two modeling approaches agreed within 16 % for the product streams and within 25 % for the auxiliary fuel rate. The discrepancy between the auxiliary fuel rates was traced to different methods of handling organics in lab packs and scintillation vials with the process models.

40|$|Whilst the {{vitrification}} {{of waste}} materials {{is a well}} established technology, hitherto {{it has not been}} economically viable on any substantial scale when applied to non-radioactive wastes. However new UK and European legislation may affect this situation. The present paper briefly reviews published work pertaining to waste vitrification in terms of legislation, <b>waste</b> <b>compositions,</b> energy, emissions and economic assessments. The focus is on vitrification of ashes arising from the incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge in terms of their composition, glass melting and reuse potential. The conclusion is that the high compositional variability of these and other wastes tends to preclude their use in many applications. However, the use of modern sorting and separation technology coupled with better control of waste treatment procedures may help to improve the range of potential uses for these wastes...|$|R
