5|$|The SS Christopher Columbus was an American {{excursion}} liner on the Great Lakes, {{in service}} between 1893 and 1933. She {{was the only}} <b>whaleback</b> ship ever built for passenger service. The ship was designed by Alexander McDougall, the developer and promoter of the <b>whaleback</b> design.|$|E

5|$|After the {{exposition}} {{ended the}} Columbus entered passenger service, {{and an additional}} deck (third superstructure, fifth total) was added during the 18991900 winter season. Despite the Columbus success at the exposition, and McDougall's promotional efforts, the <b>whaleback</b> design never caught on. By 1900, the last whalebacks had been built in Superior: the Alexander McDougall in 1899 (the last powered ship), and the John Smeaton, the last <b>whaleback</b> barge. The American Steel Barge Company was sold to the American Ship Building Company, becoming their Superior Works, and switched to more conventional laker designs.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{have claimed}} that the <b>whalebacks</b> were the {{prototype}} for the standard lake bulk carriers to follow. While certain design features were adapted to more traditional hull designs (most of the self-powered <b>whalebacks</b> were [...] "stern enders"), the <b>whalebacks</b> cannot {{be said to be}} the prototypes of all to follow. They were a unique variation on a principle of design that started with R.J. Hackett in 1869 and advanced with Onoko (the second iron-hulled Great Lakes bulk carrier) in 1882. These principles included the consolidation of above-deck cabins at the extreme forward and aft limits of the hull to leave a large open area above the hold for both loading and unloading equipment, as well as a nearly box-like cross section to the hull to enable heavy cargoes in shallow water.|$|R
50|$|Even larger {{examples}} are known from Sweden {{where they are}} referred to as flyggbergs. The Swedish flyggbergs have been interpreted by Sten Rudberg and others as reshaped inselbergs. Ice-smoothed bedrock bumps which lack the steep, plucked lee side faces {{are referred to as}} <b>whalebacks</b> or rock drumlins.|$|R
5|$|At , {{the ship}} was the longest <b>whaleback</b> ever built, and {{reportedly}} also the largest vessel on the Great Lakes when she was launched. Columbus {{is said to have}} carried more passengers during her career than any other vessel on the Great Lakes. After a career lasting four decades, she was retired during the Great Depression and scrapped in 1936 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Columbus carried between 1.7 and 2.0million {{passengers}} (sources differ) {{during the}} exposition, {{with only one}} fatality, a crew member. In recognition of that success, the commissioners of the exposition presented Captain McArthur with a gold watch engraved with {{a representation of the}} ship. McArthur went on to captain other whalebacks including the , which became the , the only <b>whaleback</b> surviving today.|$|E
5|$|After McDougall {{was unable}} to persuade {{existing}} shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, {{to be held in}} Chicago, Illinois, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize his design. The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the <b>whaleback</b> design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World.|$|E

McDougall's expense records listed the cost of {{construction}} of Frank Rockefeller as $181,573.38.|$|R
5000|$|The SS Andaste was a {{bulk cargo}} vessel built in 1892 for the Lake Superior Iron Company. The Andaste {{and her sister}} ship the Choctaw had a unique design. They were a {{straight}}-back steel freighters, similar to <b>whalebacks,</b> but they had straight sides and a conventional bow.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on their}} shape {{they are known}} as sugar loaves, <b>whalebacks,</b> turtlebacks or simply domes. They are locally known as dwalas, half-oranges, matopos, etc. Often, the {{underlying}} geological fracture pattern is shown by the surface arrangement of bornhardts, {{as can be seen}} in the Kamiesberge of Namaqualand and the Everard Ranges of Central Australia.|$|R

2500|$|The Andaste, and {{her sister}} ship the Choctaw, had an unusual design. They were {{straight}}-back steel freighters, similar to <b>whalebacks,</b> but they had straight sides and a conventional bow. [...] This combination meant that from the waterline upward, their sides sloped inboard in a [...] "tumble-home" [...] configuration. They were a hybrid called [...] "semi-whalebacks" [...] and like the true <b>whalebacks,</b> they were vulnerable to getting a wet deck in storm or gale conditions. [...] In 1898 the Andaste and the Choctaw were transferred from Lake Superior Iron to the Cleveland Cliffs Co. [...] The vessels carried coal, iron ore, and grain to and from Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes. [...] The Choctaw sank in 1916 {{as the result of}} a marine collision in Lake Huron, leaving the Andaste as a unique vessel without any sister ships. The Andaste was considered an ugly ship to look at.|$|R
25|$|Her {{career was}} short: she ran aground on 8 September 1892 in fog off Coos Bay, Oregon while {{carrying}} {{a load of}} coal from Tacoma, Washington bound for San Francisco. Salvage attempts were frustrated due to bad weather, and the vessel was abandoned. Meanwhile the Pacific Steel Barge Company yard, founded with the equipment she brought, built the SS City of Everett. No other <b>whalebacks</b> were built by the shipyard.|$|R
50|$|Trunk deck {{ships were}} {{influenced}} by (some would say copied from) turret deck ships. In 1892, the Sunderland, England firm of William Doxford and Sons Ltd. built its first turret deck ship. Inspired by U.S. <b>whalebacks,</b> one of which had recently visited Liverpool, Doxford built a ship which had a curved hull form which was stepped in above the waterline. The narrow part of the hull, called a turret, {{was part of the}} hold.|$|R

It {{contained}} approximately 58 million cubic yards (45 million cubic meters) of material. Growth of the new dome continued steadily, and small earthquakes continued to be observed every few minutes. The <b>whaleback</b> feature disintegrated steadily but continued to be extruded as solidified lava pushed upward from below.|$|E

The average loading time for a ship is 30 hours and 800 ships are loaded annually at Port Hedland.|$|E
2500|$|The Wetmore was [...] {{long with}} {{a beam of}} [...] and a [...] draft and gross tonnage of 3,000. Her power was a single [...] steam engine, but she also had four jury masts with sails for {{emergency}} use. As typical for freight <b>whalebacks,</b> {{there was a small}} turret at the bow which had anchor hoisting machinery and other equipment. Three turrets at the stern raised the stern cabin and pilothouse off the hull. Her single stack exited through one of the turrets. A typical crew complement was 22.|$|R
5000|$|The Wetmore {{was built}} in 1891 as hull #112 of the American Steel Barge Company works. The Wetmore was 264 ft long with a beam of 38 ft and a 16.4 ft draft and gross tonnage of 3,000.

500|$|The hull framing, which {{included}} nine bulkheads, was completed on September 13, 1892.

The rounded hull top was then added, followed by the six turrets, which were substantially larger than those employed on freighter <b>whalebacks.</b> The ship was launched on December 3, 1892, after which two superstructure decks were mounted on the turrets along the centerline of her hull to afford access to her two internal decks, one in the turrets {{and one in the}} hull below.|$|R
25|$|BHP's {{operations}} in Newman began in 1968, when the Mount <b>Whaleback</b> mine was opened, the biggest single-pit open-cut iron ore {{mine in the}} world. The mine is 1.5 kilometres wide and more than five kilometres long. A new town, Newman, was constructed, {{as well as a}} 426 kilometre railway line, the Mount Newman railway. The first train left Newman on 1 January 1969 and the first shipment of Newman ore left port on 1 April 1969 on board of the Osumi Maru.|$|E
25|$|At the forecastle, {{behind the}} <b>whaleback,</b> the two cargo kingposts were removed and giant davits were {{installed}} to hoist two two-story, 11-knot tenders, built by Holen Mekaniske Verksted in Norway, {{and used to}} transfer passengers between the Norway and island docks where the harbour would not allow for the ship's 9-meter (35ft) draft. These tenders were named Little Norway I and Little Norway II, and were each themselves registered as ships, making the Norway the only passenger ship {{in the world to}} carry ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} mining in the Newman area {{date back to}} when the Mount <b>Whaleback</b> deposit was {{discovered}} in 1957 by Stan Hilditch but not publicised until 1960, when the Australian Government lifted the embargo on iron ore exports it had put in place because of concerns the mineral was in short supply. The first mine to develop was the Goldsworthy mine in 1965 and a railway line, the Goldsworthy railway, as well as port facilities at Finucane Island were constructed. On 1 June 1966, the first shipment of iron ore from the Pilbara left on board of the Harvey S. Mudd.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the title}} of Queen of the Lakes is held by the modern stern-ender Paul R. Tregurtha. Launched in 1981 as William J. Delancy, and {{measuring}} 1013.5 ft, Paul R. Tregurtha has held the title since her launch. Wilfred Sykes (1949 - 678 ft) {{is considered to be}} the first of the modern lakers, and when converted to a self-unloader in 1975 was the first to have the equipment mounted aft. Since then all self-unloading equipment has been mounted aft. Algoisle (formerly Silver Isle) (1962 - 715.9 ft) was the first modern laker built with all cabins aft (a “stern-ender”), following the lead of ocean-going bulk carriers and reprising a century old form used by little river steam barges and the <b>whalebacks.</b> Stewart J. Cort (1971) was the first 1,000-footer and the only “footer” built in the classic cabins-fore-and-aft style. Algosoo (1974 - 730 ft) was the last laker built in the classic style.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a glacial geomorphological map of over 17, 000 landforms {{on the bed}} of a major palaeo-ice stream in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. The map was compiled using various geophysical datasets from multiple marine research cruises. Eight glacial landform types are identified: mega-scale glacial lineations, crag-and-tails, <b>whalebacks,</b> gouged, grooved and streamlined bedrock, grounding-zone wedges, subglacial meltwater channels, gullies and channels, and iceberg scours. The map {{represents one of the}} most complete marine ice-stream signatures available for scrutiny, and these data hold much potential for reconstructing former ice sheet dynamics, testing numerical ice sheet models, and understanding the formation of subglacial bedforms beneath ice streams. In particular, they record a complex bedform signature of palaeo-ice stream flow and retreat since the last glacial maximum, characterised by considerable spatial variability and strongly influenced by the underlying geology. The map is presented at a scale of 1 : 750, 000, designed to be printed at A 2 size, and encompasses an area of 128, 420 km 2...|$|R

25|$|While {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} were known, like the Mount <b>Whaleback</b> deposit discovered in 1957 by Stan Hilditch, {{it was not}} until 1960, when the Australian Government lifted the embargo on iron ore exports it had put in place because of concerns the mineral was in short supply, that mining began in earnest. Up until the mid-1960s, iron ore production in Western Australia, and Australia as a whole, was negligible, in the range of less than 10 million tons a year. By the mid-1970s, this figure had reached 100 million tonnes, with the majority coming from Western Australia. Production slightly declined in the 1980s but it improved in the 1990s, reaching 150 million tonnes for the country by 1997 and 200 million tonnes by 2003.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2005, the new lava dome on Mount Saint Helens {{measured}} 7,642feet (2,329m) in elevation. This brought its elevation to 1,363feet (415m) {{above the}} 1980 crater floor, approximately 2,000feet (610m) {{above the surface}} of the Crater Glacier, and 721feet (220m) below the highest point of the volcano. The <b>whaleback</b> feature measured approximately 1,550feet (470m) in length and 500feet (150m) in width. The diameter of the new dome was about 1,700feet (520m), and it contained about 50 million cubic yards (40 million cubic meters) of material. The total amount of glacier lost by this date was estimated to be 5–10%, but the flow of water from the crater was almost unchanged because the porous nature of the floor of the crater caused the water to be absorbed quickly.|$|E

50|$|Coulby's {{tenure as}} {{president}} of the fleet was marked by two major accomplishments. First, he significantly upgraded the fleet to eliminate wooden hulled ships, replacing them with much longer and larger steel-hulled vessels. He ordered the significant redesign of Great Lakes carriers as well, eliminating the curved deck of the <b>whalebacks</b> which allowed for greater access to the hold. This allowed for faster loading and unloading, and less time in port (the most costly part of shipping). He also ordered the crew cabins placed atop the deck at the stern, crew cabins placed atop the forecastle, and a pilothouse atop the forecastle cabins. This freed up space belowdecks for cargo. Coulby's redesign of the Great Lakes ore carrier, first implemented with the construction of the Elbert H. Gary in 1905, became the standard for the next 65 years. He then sold off most of the older, smaller vessels. Ship crews downsized significantly, and skilled sail crews were replaced by deskilled blue-collar workers (such as firemen, oilers, and deck watchmen). Ship captains, whose judgement about a sailor's skills often was critical, now performed far more limited roles and had little input about the makeup of the crew.|$|R
