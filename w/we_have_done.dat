Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the past... I wanted to try and take everything <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

60|$|My heart {{leaped into}} my mouth fit to choke me. The moment had come when {{everything}} which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> would be discovered, for he could not fail to see Seth if he stepped behind the screen, or of knowing what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> {{when he looked at}} the contents of the casks.|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do</b> a Shakespeare, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Macbeth. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do</b> a pre 20th-century text, {{and we did}} a play, She Stoops to Conquer. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do</b> {{poetry and}} we did Yevgeny Yevtushenko. But no novels.|$|R
5|$|We {{marched to}} the place we called Cornhill, where we had found the corn before. At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

25|$|It is {{well known}} that the axiom of choice is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set. Being able to well-order the proper class V (as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> here with L) is equivalent to the axiom of global choice, which is more powerful than the ordinary axiom of choice because it also covers proper classes of non-empty sets.|$|E
25|$|But if in {{addition}} to interchanging {{the names of the}} values we also interchange the names of the two binary operations, now there is no trace of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> The end product is completely indistinguishable from what we started with. We might notice that the columns for x∧y and x∨y in the truth tables had changed places, but that switch is immaterial.|$|E

25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren.

500|$|Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the decision in the Scientology case. Davies commented in an interview with The New York Times, [...] "It was obvious that this case was going to be controversial pretty much from the start. What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> is we've really tried {{to make sure that we}} have not directed our fire at anyone in particular." [...] He noted there was a recurring pattern of disputed editing on controversial topics, [...] "One of the problems we keep bumping into is what I call core belief issues — politics, religion, nationalism. Fringe faiths, fringe nationalities." ...|$|E

However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to remind us, not so much, perhaps, of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> as what we have, in our time, known we might do".|$|E

500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how she would look in the video.

[...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E
500|$|That same day, Bloomsbury {{cancelled}} all Asda's {{orders of}} Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills {{from the company}} totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth Harry Potter book. [...] "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, [...] "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody." [...] The dispute had been [...] "going on a while – going on for weeks actually." [...] Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for them") and that, as one company spokesman claimed, [...] "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying {{everything they can to}} stop kids getting hold of Harry Potter at a price they can afford." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning of}} the operation, General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the {{professional}} head of the British Armed Forces—was coincidentally due to appear on Breakfast with Frost, a Sunday morning political television programme hosted by Sir David Frost. The first public knowledge of Operation Barras came from Guthrie's interview with Frost, which took place while the operation was still concluding. Guthrie told Frost [...] "e didn't {{want to have to}} assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere. The hostages had been there [...] for three weeks, they [...] were threatening to kill them, or they were threatening to move them to other parts of Sierra Leone and once they'd done that we'd never be able to recover [...] with ease, which I hope we've done this morning". The MoD issued a press release with more details later in the day.|$|E

500|$|Jordan {{claimed to}} have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on Balqa Governorate in {{intentions}} of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone, {{which was supposed to}} serve as a punishment, due to the Jordanian support to the PLO. The Jordanians made this assumption as they saw the size of the raiding Israeli forces entering the battle. Arafat said [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> is to make the world... realize that the Palestinian is no longer refugee number so and so, but the member of a people who hold the reins of their own destiny and {{are in a position to}} determine their own future". Palestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory over the IDF, which had been seen as 'invincible' until then, and recruitment to guerilla units soared. Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of the battle. By late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} drivers {{competing}} in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> a great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat." ...|$|E
500|$|Lim Kit Siang {{attributed}} the opposition's defeat to Mahathir's liberalism and the government's {{adoption of the}} DAP's stance on issues like [...] "language, culture and education". Some, however, doubted Mahathir's sincerity. One UMNO Youth official suggested that [...] "The Barisan government's flexible move... only shows that we are enjoying {{the highest level of}} tolerance purely based on the level of confidence in terms of political and economic position of the Malays. We share the political power with the Chinese. When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese. So, why shouldn't we allow that? We can... achieve a win-win situation. This is a purely political move.... Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests.... However, those finished agendas that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> such as Islam, Bahasa Melayu [...] and the special status of the Malays, should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues." ...|$|E
