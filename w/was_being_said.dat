25|$|The fourth test saw a {{fighting}} spirit by the Aussies when they scored 262 but dismissed India for 272 and not letting them take a lead bigger than 10 runs. The {{first two days}} were filled with sledging by the Aussies. On day two, it <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> that the match was evenly poised but continuous collapse of Australia on day three did not enable them to set a good target despite a fifty by Peter Siddle in both the innings which created a record for half-centuries in both the innings of a test match by a number 9 batsman. India got a target of 155 and they achieved it easily {{on the same day}} with contribution from Kohli's 41, Dhoni's 12 not out and Pujara not out on 82. Dhoni hit the winning runs and India created history by winning four test matches in a series {{for the first time ever}} in their test history. Ravindra Jadeja was awarded the Man Of The Match award for his career best 5–58 and Ravichandran Ashwin was named the Man Of The Series for getting 29 wickets in four matches.|$|E
25|$|A JAG Manual {{investigation}} commenced {{immediately after}} the fire, in accordance with Navy policy. The investigation determined that the initial explosion was caused by overheating of the Zuni rocket by the huffer exhaust. Investigators also determined that although concerns about the exhaust and placement of the huffer were raised by an airman who observed the exhaust, the personnel to whom the concerns were raised were involved in other tasks, and may not have completely understood what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> due to the ambient noise on the flight deck; however, the investigators also noted that moving the unit may not {{have made a difference}} in whether the initial explosion occurred or not, due to the estimated temperature of the rocket by that time. The investigation also revealed that flight-deck personnel did not have an understanding of ordnance cook-off times, and as a result may not have had an appreciation of the hazards posed by live ordnance on the flight deck. Among the items deemed to have had some sort of impact of firefighting operations were lack of redundancies in communication systems and firefighting system controls and components; lack of communication between the Air Boss, who was responsible for flight and hangar deck firefighting, and the Damage Control Assistant, who was responsible for all other firefighting operations; and overtasking of the fire-main system due to activation of multiple systems at once.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said.</b> This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

Antonio Meucci invented the first device {{that allowed the}} electrical transmission of voice over a line in 1849. However Meucci's device was of little practical value because it relied upon the electrophonic effect and thus required users to place the receiver in their mouth to [...] "hear" [...] what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said.</b> The first commercial telephone services were set-up in 1878 and 1879 {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic in the cities of New Haven and London.|$|E

Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he did not want to play anymore.

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said.</b> On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E
500|$|The Shadow of the Glen, {{based on}} a story about an unfaithful wife, was {{attacked}} in print by the Irish nationalist leader Arthur Griffith as [...] "a slur on Irish womanhood". Years later Synge wrote: [...] "When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen some years ago I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in {{the floor of the}} old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> by the servant girls in the kitchen." [...] This encouraged more critical attacks alleging that Synge described Irish women in an unfair manner. Riders to the Sea was also attacked by nationalists, this time including Patrick Pearse, who decried it because of the author's attitude to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other conservative-minded Catholics claimed Synge had done a disservice to Irish nationalism by not idealising his characters. However, later critics have attacked Synge for idealising the Irish peasantry too much. A third one-act play, The Tinker's Wedding, was drafted around this time, but Synge initially made no attempt to have it performed, largely because of a scene in which a priest is tied up in a sack, which, as he wrote to the publisher Elkin Mathews in 1905, would probably upset [...] "a good many of our Dublin friends".|$|E
500|$|In {{a lively}} {{exchange}} over {{what has come}} to be referred to as [...] "the Chinese room argument", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls [...] "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" [...] that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of [...] "weak AI" [...] that computer programs can be formatted to [...] "simulate" [...] conscious states. [...] His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are. [...] To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. [...] In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program. [...] Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean. [...] If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> and the purposes it might serve. [...] Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English. [...] Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.|$|E

2500|$|Future {{factional}} ally Benjamin Gitlow {{later recalled}} the initial impression which Pepper made upon {{him when he}} first {{met him at the}} Bridgman convention: [...] The second of the three Comintern nuncios looked like a Hungarian version of the proverbial traveling salesman. Short and stocky, with a large head and a disproportionately larger nose that proudly bore a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles perched importantly on its bridge, he dressed like a dude, combed his hair sleek and neat, was always clean-shaven, smoked gold-tipped cigarettes, listened attentively to everything that <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> in his presence, and said absolutely nothing....

2500|$|Among {{the early}} church fathers, {{it was noted that}} the offices of elder and bishop were identical, and were not {{differentiated}} until later, and that plurality of elders was the norm for church government. St. Jerome (347–420) [...] "In Epistle Titus", vol. iv, said, [...] "Elder is identical with bishop; and before the urging of the devil gave rise to factionalism in religion, so much that it <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> among the people, 'I am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Cephas', the churches were governed by a joint council of elders. After it was... decreed throughout the world that one chosen from among the presbyters should be placed over the others." [...] This observation was also made by Chrysostom (349–407) in [...] "Homilia i, in Phil. i, 1" [...] and Theodoret (393–457) in [...] "Interpret ad. Phil. iii", 445.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent of}} Levi Woodburys {{contribution}} to maritime safety over this period can be gauged {{by the fact}} that she was one of only two cutters assigned to patrol the Maine coastline, and that these waters, with their [...] "immense number of shoals, rocks, reefs and islands", combined with the [...] "very strong tides, high winds, fog, vapor and ice" [...] typically accounted for about four fifths of the total number of ships aided by the Revenue Cutter Service each year. For example, in 1888, of the 526 ships in distress aided by the Service during the year, 400 were assisted by the two Maine cutters. Levi Woodbury had already accumulated a [...] "remarkable" [...] record of assistance by 1883; by 1892, it <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> of her that she had [...] "battled with more ice"—and by extension, assisted more ships in distress—than any other steamer on the Eastern seaboard.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first four}} {{films of the}} series were {{produced}} and written by Frank Capra from 1952–1956. As described by biographer Joseph McBride, Capra had retired from feature filmmaking by 1952, {{due in part to}} the turmoil of the Hollywood Blacklist era. McBride writes that Capra [...] "undoubtedly realized that the AT job was a way of going back to work quietly and rehabilitating his image." [...] Matthew Gunter compares Capra's involvement with the Bell series to his work on wartime propaganda and training films, [...] "As in the creation of the war documentaries, Capra dove into the work and rediscovered his passion for the filmmaking process. Like his work on the war films, he employed found footage and animation to verify, illustrate, and document what <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>said</b> in the voice-over narration." [...] Capra later described the films, [...] "Those four films about science, hand woven with bits of celluloid, were sprightly patterns of poesy and fact; fresh ideas were their main charm, a rather elegant charm, we thought, much like the light-hearted but disciplined charm of a Mozart composition." [...] After the Bell series, Capra returned to feature films as the director of A Hole in the Head (1959).|$|E
