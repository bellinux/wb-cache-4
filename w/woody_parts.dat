Most breeds {{prefer to}} graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller <b>woody</b> <b>parts</b> {{of plants that}} goats readily consume. Both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition. Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.|$|E
60|$|Though {{reason and}} my long {{residence}} here had assured me, that these savages {{never came up}} to the thick <b>woody</b> <b>parts</b> of the country, and that I had no reason to be apprehensive of a discovery; yet such an abhorence did I still retain, that, for two years after, I confined myself only to my three plantation: I mean my castle, country-seat, and inclosure in the woods. And though in process of time, my dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my eyes were more vigilant for fear of being heard by those creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved, however, manfully to lose my life if they did, and went armed with three pistols stuck in my girdle, which added to the description I have given of myself before, made me look with a very formidable appearance.|$|E

50|$|Black Knot occurs {{only on the}} <b>woody</b> <b>parts</b> of trees, {{primarily}} on twigs and branches, but can spread to larger limbs and even the trunk. Olive-green swellings from the disease are visible in the late spring; as it spreads and matures, typically by autumn, rough black knots circle and kill affected parts. The knots vary in diameter from one inch to one foot (2.5 cm - 30 cm). Older knots can kill trees by promoting insect infestations.|$|E
30|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} total ion chromatograms of the mono- and sesquiterpenes {{obtained}} by the GC–MS analysis of sample no. 1. Mono- and sesquiterpenes in the <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> did not exist or were of very few amounts, because the extract of the <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> of the plant did not yield clear peaks in the chromatogram. The chromatograms {{of the other two}} plants yielded very similar results. The 1, 8 -cineol and linalool contents were higher than those of the other terpenes in the leaf extracts. In the twig and bark samples, linalool was detected clearly as a strong peak among the terpenes. While a chemical analysis of the essential oil of Oba-kuromozi has been reported, most studies focused on the essential oil of the leaves only or a mixture of leaves and branches. Furuhata et al. [17] reported differences in the components of kuromozi essential oil between the leaves and branches using an early GC instrument. However, until now, there were no studies of the components of the extracts of the leaves, barks, and twigs in Oba-kuromozi. Our results demonstrated that there are differences in the composition of the extracts of each tissue of the Oba-kuromozi plants. Therefore, preparing extracts from different plant tissues individually provide greater insights into the composition of the Oba-kuromozi oil.|$|R

According to reports, the youths came across a nearly naked Webster and chased him to a parking area, where they beat him with baseball bats. After the beating, Webster was found beside a path in the park by his close friend Tim Chisholm, and died within minutes in Chisholm's arms.|$|R
50|$|The {{surfaces}} of the acclivities often slid off together with the vegetation. Former valleys, which had been blocked due to re-allocation, were flushed out. In some terraces dramatic shear failures developed. In addition extensive, devastating frost damage occurred; due to the incline of the mountainside at the {{surfaces of}} the acclivities, cold air pockets were formed in which the vines in bloom were frostbitten. Additionally substantial frost damage occurred in the <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> of the vines, especially in the vineyards which were situated in lower regions. In earlier times fruit had mostly been grown here but later this was changed to vineyards.|$|R
50|$|Paeonia delavayi is a {{deciduous}} hairless shrub of ¼-1¾ m high. Plants have creeping stolons and {{the roots}} are thick {{because they are}} fused together. It mainly reproduces by growing into large clones like this. Young twigs are light green, or tinged purple, rarely branching, erect, generally on top of perennial, stick-like, grayish to light brown stems. In lower plants, <b>woody</b> <b>parts</b> may not be present above ground. Like all diploid peonies, it has ten chromosomes (2n=10).|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on Chamaecytisus albus, Chamaecytisus austriacus, Chamaecytisus hirsutus, Chamaecytisus ratisbonensis, Chamaecytisus ruthenicus, Cytisus procumbens and Lembotropis nigricans. The larvae make galls {{on their}} host plant. The egg is {{deposited}} on the stem where later the gall forms {{and is usually}} difficult to see. The larva first bores into the parenchyma and then feeds in a spiral gallery around the stem, successively moving upwards, also partly boring in the central <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> of the stem. The stem is thickened more or less considerably by the larval activity. The frass is deposited in the gallery, almost filling it. Pupation takes place outside of the gall.|$|R
50|$|Myrsine divaricata {{known as}} weeping māpou or weeping matipo, {{is a small}} tree up to 4m tall or often a shrub. It has a {{strongly}} divaricating habit with interlaced branched.

5000|$|The Swiss company Litrax is {{one company}} {{involved}} in the manufacturing of bamboo fibre. Litrax claims to use a more natural way of processing the bamboo into fibre. In this the <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> of the bamboo is crushed mechanically before a natural enzyme retting and washing process is used {{to break down the}} walls and extract the bamboo fibre. This bast fibre is then spun into yarn. [...] In fine counts the yarn has a silky touch. The same manufacturing process is used to produce linen fabric from flax or hemp. Bamboo fabric made from this process is sometimes called bamboo linen. The natural processing of litrax bamboo allows the fibre to remain strong to produce an extremely high quality product. This process gives a material that is very durable.|$|R
40|$|In {{attempts}} to discover anti-HIV agents from natural sources, various traditional medicine extracts were tested for their inhibitory effects on HIV- 1 proliferation and its protease. An extract {{of the seeds}} of Croton tiglium showed potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HIV- 1. The active principle {{was determined to be}} phorbol esters. Several derivatives of phorbol ester were evaluated for inhibition of proliferation as well as activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Of these compounds, 12 -O-acetylphorbol 13 -decanoate (6) showed the most potent inhibition of proliferation without activating PKC. Some triterpenes from the stems of Cynomorium songaricum and the <b>woody</b> <b>part</b> of Xan- thoceras sorbifolia showed inhibitory activity against HIV- 1 protease. Various derivatives of oleanolic acid were synthe- sized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against HIV- 1 protease. Their inhibitory mechanism was also investigated...|$|R
