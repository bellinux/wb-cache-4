25|$|Due to a {{combination}} of resentment of Americans settling {{on the wrong side of}} the treaty line and pressure from the Muscogee, warriors of the Overhill Towns picked up the tomahawk in early July, led by John Watts. They were supported by Cherokee of the Valley Towns, and according to some accounts the army <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as a thousand strong. First attacking a homestead on Beaver Creek near the newly established White's Fort (at the modern Knoxville, Tennessee) on July 20, they dispersed into small parties raiding the upper Holston and other parts of Franklin.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite how ridiculous it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really {{knows how to do}} big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>big,</b> dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E

500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one could see all over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{switching}} to ABC Records {{in the late}} 1960s, he found himself {{at the top of}} the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, [...] "I'll Take Care of Your Cares". Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, [...] "Cares" [...] had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts. A string of hits followed including [...] "Making Memories", [...] "You Wanted Someone to Play With", [...] "Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got)", [...] "To Each His Own", [...] "I Found You", and [...] "Lord, You Gave Me A Mountain" [...] (which was written by Marty Robbins).

2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a step as going in to record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|E
