50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>carrier</b> (also <b>water</b> seller) is a {{profession}} that existed {{before the advent}} of centralized water supply systems. A <b>water</b> <b>carrier</b> collected <b>water</b> from a source (a river, a well, water pumps, etc.) and transported or carried containers with water to people's homes. After the construction of pipe networks, the profession of <b>water</b> <b>carrier</b> became unnecessary and disappeared.|$|R

50|$|The National <b>Water</b> <b>Carrier</b> was {{completed}} by Mekorot in 1964. It consists of around 134 km of large pipes, tunnels, and reservoirs and around 34 km of open canals. The <b>water</b> <b>carrier</b> channels an average of 380 MCM of water {{a year from the}} Kinneret. Water from the Jordan River flows into the Kinneret, which is how Israel uses the <b>water</b> <b>carrier</b> to divert 75% of the water from the Jordan River to Israel. The amount of fresh water that flows in the Jordan River as well as the Dead Sea has significantly declined {{as a result of this}} diversion. The Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal has been proposed as a way to remedy the shrinking, though right now it is only a proposal.|$|R
