Root distributions were determined for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in a wheat-fallow rotation during the 1977 - 1978 winter wheat crop year on an Alliance silt loam (Aridic Argiustoll). The fallow tillage treatments were plow, subtillage, and chemical (no tillage). Each tillage treatment was split into subplots for N application of 0 or 45 kg/ha. Rooting density {{was determined by}} washing the roots in soil cores 7. 6 cm in diam by 15 cm long extracted to depths of 90, 105, and 120 cm on 28 Mar., 2 May, and 8 June 1978, respectively. After root length was determined, roots were dried and <b>weighed.</b> <b>Soil</b> penetration resistance was determined with depth in the soil by inserting a penetrometer horizontally 4 cm into the soil at vertical intervals of 10 cm from the surface. Root weight was greatest for the chemical treatment (46 mg/dm 3) and least for the subtillage treatment (26 mg/dm 3). Approximately 62 % of the total root mass was in the upper 30 cm of soil with maximum rooting depth greater than 120 cm for all treatments by 8 June 1978. Root development was limited by the alluvial horizon {{at a depth of}} about 25 to 40 cm. Visual observations also showed some root resistance by tillage shear plane at 10 cm. Nitrogen fertilization did not significantly change the rooting pattern; however, the N-by-tillage interaction for root weight was significant at the second sampling date-the subtillage treatment showed a positive response to added N, while chemical and plow treatments showed a negative response. Wheat yields were not significantly influenced by fallow tillage or N. This indicated that root development occurring above and below the resistant layer was sufficient to supply the plan; with its water and mineral needs...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Prevention of {{groundwater}} contamination by agricultural chemicals {{requires an understanding}} of the complex processes that control pesticide movement below the soil surface. Through this understanding it is possible to try to predict which areas may be most vulnerable to contamination. The many models that have been developed to characterize pesticide movement vary widely in their conceptual approach and degree of complexity. A soil properties model was developed in this thesis to determine the relative overall pesticide movement potential in Oregon agricultural soils. Its focus is ease of use in both acquisition of input values and running of the model. The model is based on soil properties important in controlling pesticide movement. It is a rating system model that uses scoring of factors and matrices to <b>weigh</b> the <b>soil</b> values. It is organized into two processes: leaching and sorption. The leaching potential is based on soil permeability and drainage class. The sorption potential is based on organic matter content and texture of the soil surface horizon(s).

40|$|Dry {{desert climate}} {{required}} {{search for the}} best ways to conserve water. The present study was conducted to minimize evaporation using mulching with different rates in two soils (Loamy Sand and Sandy Clay Loam). Sawdust mulch rates used were 0. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 cm depth. Tape water was added to soil columns on the basis of required water to saturate soil. After the leachate (free water drainage) ceased, evaporation experiment was started until stable weight of the control (no mulch) was achieved (83 days). The cumulative evaporation (E) was determined by daily <b>weighing</b> <b>soil</b> columns. The soil water (), and salts (ECe) distribution on soil profiles were determined each 10 cm increments before and after evaporation experiments. 	Results indicated that the two soils had different hydrophysical properties, such that Sandy Clay Loam soil was higher in water retention. The study revealed that sawdust mulching reduced evaporation significantly on both soils. Mulching with 2 cm depth was enough for evaporation reduction to a rate lower than that of water flow toward soil surface. Results indicated that there is a linear relationship between E and the square root of time (t) (E = bt 1 / 2) for all mulching rates of both soils. It has been found that the soil water profile distribution was significantly higher with mulched soil columns compared with the control for both soils. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between sawdust mulching with 2 or 4 cm depth. These results were reflected on the soil water storage, where mulched soil columns were higher than that of the control. In general, results of evaporation, soil water distribution and water storage proved that sawdust mulching with 2 cm depth was enough to limit evaporation and conserve water for both soils. This effect was more pronounced in loamy sand soil. 	In general, the results of the EC and salt distribution (ECe) after the leachate ceased showed that salts were decreased on the upper soil layers, and increased on the lower soil layers for both soils and also in leachate. Results also showed that salts were redistributed after evaporation period, where salts moved toward the upper soil layers especially in the control soil columns. Results revealed that salt distribution reached equilibrium state in mulched soil columns of loamy sand soil, whereas sandy clay soil did not reach such equilibrium in loam soil. This study emphasizes the importance of mulching to limit evaporation, increase soil water storage and thus availability of water for plant growth. Two cm depth (28. 41 Mg/ha) sawdust mulch was found to be enough to achieve that target...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of a rapid method to evaluate the soil water content (U) {{can be an important}} tool to determine the moment to irrigate. The soil areometer consists of an elongated hydrostatic balance with a weighing pan, a graduated neck, a float and a pynometric flask. In this work an areometer was adapted to rapidly measure soil water content without the need of drying the soil. The expression U = (M A - M AD) /(M M -M A) was used to calculate the soil water content. In this equation M M is the mass to level the areometer with the pycnometric flask filled with water, M A the mass to level the areometer with a mass M M of soil in the pycnometer, the volume being completed with water, and similarly M AD the mass added to the pan to level the areometer with a mass M M of dried soil in the pycnometric flask. The convenience of this method is that the values M M and M AD are known. Consequently, the decision on irrigation can be made after a measurement that takes, about, ten minutes. The procedure involves only stirring the soil with water for at least 2 minutes to remove the adhered air. The soil water content data obtained with the areometric method were similar to those obtained <b>weighing</b> the <b>soil</b> before and after drying to constant weight, in an oven at 105 º C...|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} soil makes direct {{observation}} of food webs difficult. Since soil organisms {{range in size}} from less than 0.1 mm (nematodes) to greater than 2 mm (earthworms) there are many different ways to extract them. Soil samples are often taken using a metal core. Larger macrofauna such as earthworms and insect larva can be removed by hand, but this is impossible for smaller nematodes and soil arthropods. Most methods to extract small organisms are dynamic; they depend on the ability of the organisms {{to move out of the}} soil. For example, a Berlese funnel, used to collect small arthropods, creates a light/heat gradient in the soil sample. As the microarthropods move down, away from the light and heat, they fall through a funnel and into a collection vial. A similar method, the Baermann funnel, is used for nematodes. The Baerman funnel is wet, however (while the Berlese funnel is dry) and does not depend on a light/heat gradient. Nematodes move out of the soil and to the bottom of the funnel because, as they move, they are denser than water and are unable to swim. Soil microbial communities are characterized in many different ways. The activity of microbes can be measured by their respiration and carbon dioxide release. The cellular components of microbes can be extracted from soil and genetically profiled, or microbial biomass can be calculated by <b>weighing</b> the <b>soil</b> before and after fumigation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{first part}} of this paper compares two {{algorithms}} relating daily evaporation to potential evaporation and simulated soil water content. The first algorithm assumes that the ratio of actual to potential evaporation is a single-valued function of water content. The second algorithm, which appears to be conceptually superior, determines the actual evaporation as the smaller of the potential evaporation and a rate determined by the soil water content. The comparison is based on evaporation data from a deep <b>weighing</b> lysimeter, and <b>soil</b> water data obtained by a neutron moisture meter, the vegetation being a deep-rooted pasture grass. Although there is considerable scatter in the results, the second algorithm performs slightly better than the first. The second part of the paper examines the hypothesis that runoff is only marginally affected by day-to-day variations in evaporation, and thus average monthly potential evaporation data can be used in place of daily data as a model input. Results from 4 models applied to data for 15 Australian benchmark catchments suggest this hypothesis is correct, and furthermore that for some catchments the best fit of all models to runoff data is obtained with unrealistically high values of potential evaporation...|$|R

As demandas evaporativas de 3, 6 e 8 mm d- 1 foram obtidas por meio de lâmpadas incandescentes, dispostas sobre as colunas de solo, a uma altura de 10 cm. A coleta de dados foi realizada diariamente, por meio da pesagem das colunas de solo, utilizando-se uma balança digital com capacidade máxima de 32. 100 g e precisão de 1 g. A taxa de evaporação da água do solo descoberto apresentou comportamento distinto para as três demandas evaporativas utilizadas. As reduções na evaporação da água do solo para as taxas de 100 % da matéria seca produzida, para a cultura do milho (10. 000 kg ha- 1), para as demandas evaporativas de 8, 6 e 3 mm d- 1, foram de 13, 17 e 25 %, respectivamente. In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of the corn crop residue on the soil water evaporation was analyzed. The experimental treatments consisted of three rates of corn residue (stalk), 0, 50 and 100 % of the dry matter yield by irrigated corn crop system; three evaporative demands of 3, 6, and 8 mm d- 1; and two soils of different texture, sandy loam and clay soil, with 84 % of sand and 76 % of clay, respectively. The experiment was carried out in laboratory, with the soil conditioned in PVC columns of 45 cm in height and 20 cm in diameter. The water evaporative demands of 3, 6 and 8 mm d- 1 were obtained by means of incandescent lamps, fixed on the soil columns at a height of 10 cm. The daily data collection was accomplished by means of <b>weighing</b> the <b>soil</b> columns, using a digital scale with maximum capacity of 32, 100 g and precision of 1. 0 g. The direct water evaporation rate from the soil columns presented different behavior for the three water evaporative demands. The reductions in the soil water evaporation for the dry matter yield rates of 100 %, for the corn crop equivalent to 10. 000 kg ha- 1, for the water evaporative demands of 8, 6, and 3 mm d- 1, were 13, 17 and 25 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Soil conditioners i. e. natural {{deposits}} and organic fertilizer {{are used for}} improving some of poor physical properties of sandy soils such as low water retention and inefficient water use, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The present study aims to investigate the impact of clay {{deposits and}} organic fertilizer on water characteristics, cumulative infiltration and intermittent evaporation of loamy sand soil. Soil sample was collected from surface layer (0 - 30 cm depth) of the Agricultural Experiment and Research Station at Dierab, 40 Km south west of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Two samples of clay deposits (CD# 22 & CD# 23) collected from Khyleis area and Jeddah-Madina road in addition of commercial organic fertilizer (OF) {{were used in the}} present study. The soil mixed with clay deposits and organic fertilizer at rates of 0, 1, 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 % (w/w). The soil column packed with soil to depth of 30 cm every 5. 0 cm to insure a homogeneous of soil in column. The clay deposits (CD# 22 and CD# 23) and organic fertilizer (OF) mixed with the soil were packed in the upper 0 - 5 cm of each soil column. The infiltration experiment was done using a flooding apparatus (Marriot device) with constant head of 3. 0 cm over the soil surface. The cumulative infiltration and wetting front depth as a function of time were recorded. The evaporation experiment was conducted in 40 cm long transparent sectioned Lucite cylinders (5. 0 cm ID). Fifty millimeters of tap water were applied weekly for three wetting /drying cycles. Cumulative evaporation against time was measured daily by <b>weighing</b> each <b>soil</b> column. The soil moisture distribution {{at the end of the}} experiment was determined gravimetrically for each 5. 0 cm interval. The results indicated that the three conditioners significantly increased the water constants of mixed soil (i. e. SWC, FC, PWP and AW), but the CD# 22 has a superior effect. The results clearly indicated that increasing the application rate of conditioners significantly decreased the cumulative infiltration (D). The decrease in D more pronounced at higher rates. The CD# 22 was more effective in reducing the cumulative infiltration. The relationship between (D) as a function of time (T) was done by fitting the data to the Kostiakov and Philip equations. Increasing the application rate of natural conditioners restricted the wetting front movement and need more time to reach 30 cm depth. The natural conditioners significantly reduced the cumulative evaporation throughout the 3 evaporation cycles. The reduction significantly increased with increasing the application rate, except for the higher rate (10 %), which increases the cumulative evaporation under the present conditions. The improvement of soil hydro-physical properties and reduction in water infiltration and cumulative evaporation are good practices for plant growth in region limited in water such as most regions in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Knowing the {{biodiversity}} of dung beetles in agricultural and livestock environments {{is the basis}} for understanding the contribution that these organisms make in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functions. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the structure of copronecrophagous dung beetle communities inhabiting the main agroecosystems in southern Brazil and correlate the presence of these organisms with soil properties. From December 2012 to April 2013, samples of dung beetles were taken in the municipality of Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil (28 ° 28 &# 8217; S; 48 ° 56 &# 8217; W) in corn, bean, and sugarcane crops, and in cattle pastures. Beetles were captured in 16 sampling sites, four from each agroecosystem, following a standardized methodology: 10 baited pitfall traps (feces and rotting meat) at a spacing of 50 m with exposure for 48 h. The beetles were identified, <b>weighed,</b> and measured. <b>Soil</b> analyses were performed in order to correlate data on organic matter, texture, macro and micronutrients, and pH with data on the abundance of beetle species using canonical correspondence analysis. A total of 110 individuals belonging to 10 species of dung beetles was found. Twenty-four individuals from seven species (with total biomass of 2. 4 g) were found in the corn crop; five individuals from three species (1. 8 g) were found in the bean crop; 81 individuals from nine species (30. 3 g) were found in cattle pasture areas; and lastly, there were no dung beetles recorded in the sugarcane crop. In areas of cattle grazing, the tunnelers Dichotomius nisus and Trichillum externepunctatum correlated positively with organic matter content, whereas the roller species Canthon chalybaeus correlated positively with soil texture, preferring sandier soils. In corn crop areas, D. nisus was again correlated with organic matter content. Paracoprid dung beetle species were correlated with organic matter content in the soil, and species belonging to the roller functional group were associated with soil texture in the corn crop, preferring sandy soils. Information regarding the relationship of dung beetles with physical-chemical soil properties may be an important strategy for increasing fertility and management of soil conservation in agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{biodegradation}} {{methods of}} hydrocarbon contaminated soils {{that can occur}} through biodegradation, bio augmentation, bio stimulation, and phytoremediation, have gained significant interest in recent years {{when compared to the}} conventional methods. The study was designed to explore the influence of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination on physicochemical and microbial characteristics of soils as well as determining the possibility of hydrocarbon biodegradation using biostimulation. The process involved soil characterisation and modification of nitrogen and phosphorus content to stimulate naturally adapting microorganisms. Characterisation process determined that hydrocarbon contamination of Murowa soils introduced hydrophobicity to the naturally wettable sandy loam soils. Naturally adapting microbial species capable of degrading hydrocarbons identified using Direct microscopy, Gram and Melzer’s iodine staining included Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Serratia marcescens, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Streptomyces Staphylococcus, Penicillium and yeasts. The N: P nutrient ratio and moisture levels were identified as potential limiting factors and hence experiments focused on manipulation of N: P nutrients to stimulate the identified hydrocarbon degrading organisms (bio stimulation). Hydrocarbons were identified by solvent extraction using hexane and gas chromatography. These included decane, undecane, hexadecanal, 2 -ethylcridine, octadecane and 1 -iodo. <b>Soils</b> <b>weighing</b> 10 kgs with hydrocarbons levels of about 265 mg/kg were subjected to eight (8) treatments with seven (7) different combinations of N (6000 - 12000 mgN) : P (600 - 3000 mgP) concentration ranges including the control. Nitrogen The moisture was adjusted and tilling for aeration was done on a weekly basis. Changes in Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH), C: N: P ratio, microbial mass and pH were evaluated over 111 consecutive days. The optimum N:P ratio was the determined to 2 : 1 molar ratio in form of 6000 mgN: 3000 mgP. TPH concentration was reduced by 73 % from the initial concentration within the first 74 days. Beyond 74 days there were no significant changes in the TPH concentration and this was attributed to the presence of more complex insoluble hydrocarbons which needed more time and an additional bio surfactant to complete mineralization. The conclusion was that a combination of natural attenuation and biostimulation methods can be used to bioremediate Murowa hydrocarbon contaminated soils using the 2 : 1 molar ratio of whatCollege of Agriculture and Environmental SciencesM.

Also, the effects of various water table depths were evaluated on salt movement and the fate of NO[subscript] 3 -N under simultaneous irrigation and drainage practices;Two sets of experiments were conducted in the laboratory under simulated saline and waterlogged conditions. Three sets of soil columns (45, 75, and 115 -cm long) were fabricated using PVC pipes of 20. 0 cm diameter for this study. Large columns (115 -cm long) were filled with a sandy loam soil brought from the bank of Squaw Creek river near Ames, Iowa. For one experiment, these long columns were filled with soil in seven layers of different bulk densities. For other four experiments, the soil was filled in the columns uniformly by mixing the entire soil profile to give a single bulk density for the entire column;For the short columns, two types of soils were used (sandy loam soil from Squaw Creek and nicollet loam soil from Iowa State University Farm at Ankeny, Iowa) to pack the columns. These soils were packed in the columns at uniform densities of 1. 40 and 1. 25 g/cm[superscript] 3 for sandy loam and nicollet loam soils, respectively;The salt equilibria were obtained by mixing weighed amounts of salts in <b>weighed</b> amounts of <b>soil,</b> and by subsequent saturating the soil in the columns with desired salt concentrations.

A description is given of practical rapid methods {{of determining the}} oxidizable sulfur and change of soil reaction of these soils. Recommended experimental procedures are as follows: A <b>weighed</b> quantity of <b>soil</b> (about 1 - 2 g) is mixed with 10 ml of 30 % H 2 O 2, adjusting the pH to 6. 0 - 6. 5 with N/ 10 NaOH and removing the sulfuric acid when contained with Ba (OH) 2, and heated for about 1 hour on water bath. After cooling, the contents are filled up to 100 ml and filtered. Soil pH value is determined in this soil suspension {{by means of the}} pH meter and glass electrode. Titrable acidity is determined by titrating 50 ml of this filtrate with N/ 10 NaOH and the result is given in terms of ml N/ 10 NaOH per 100 g soil. Active oxidizable sulfur is calculated from sulfuric acid equivalent to titrable acidity and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Easily oxidizable sulfur is determined from the difference between the water soluble sulfate of the H 2 O 2 -treated soil and that of original soil and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Sulfate is determined volumetrically by Benzidine sulfate method. The reliability of this method was examined with sea muds collected from sea bottom, saline pond soils, transported soils derived from sea muds and saline polder soils. The data obtained showed that saline pond soils and some of polder soils contained appreciable amounts of easily oxidizable sulfur and the pH values of these soils became extremely acid after oxidation with H 2 O 2 and easily oxidizable sulfur of fresh soils amounted to over 80 % of total sulfur determined from the difference between the sulfate content of the aqua regia extract and that of the water extract of the soils. (See Table 1 and 2) A considerable difference was frequently found between active oxidizable sulfur and easily oxidizable sulfur and it was shown that the relative amounts of oxidizable sulfur and easily soluble base compounds determine titrable acidity, active oxidizable sulfur and soil pH value of H 2 O 2 -treated soil. (See Table 3) The pH values of transported soils derived from sea muds were found to gradually approach in natural fields to the pH values determined by H 2 O 2 -treatment. (See Table 4...|$|R
40|$|Because of fuel consumption, {{machinery}} and labor costs, tillage involves high expenses. In {{a project that}} {{was carried out in}} the autumn of 2001 and 2002, energy consumption and draught were studied for three tillage implements on a lighter and a heavier soil under wet, moist and dry conditions. Furthermore, aggregate size distribution and energy requirement for fracturing the soil were measured. The tillage implements used were mouldboard plough, chisel plough and disc cultivator. The effects of driving speed and depth of tillage were also studied. Soil strength was measured with both a penetrometer and a shear vane apparatus. The tractor used was a Valmet 6600 (100 hp) with equipment for measuring fuel consumption. The equipment was calibrated to give the PTO effect for any combination of fuel consumption and engine speed, and this was assumed to be the same as the effect available at the tractor wheels. The “tow bar power” was calculated by subtraction of power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. Average actual working depth was calculated by measuring bulk density before tillage and then <b>weighing</b> the cultivated <b>soil.</b> On the basis of the tillage depth and PTO effect measurements, it was possible to calculate energy requirement per kg cultivated soil and specific draught. The latter is defined as force per cross sectional area cultivated soil [kN/m 2]. After sieving samples of the cultivated soil, the approximate surface area of the fragmented soil and the energy requirement for fracturing were computed. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough, while the highest values were obtained for the chisel plough. Specific draught decreased with increasing soil water content. The lowest values of energy requirement for fracturing were measured under moist conditions for all tillage implements, and the disc cultivator produced the highest fracturing in relation to energy input. Both specific draught and energy requirement for fracturing were lower for the lighter soil. With the disc cultivator, specific draught increased with working depth, while depth had no influence on specific draught when the mouldboard plough was used. Some of these differences can be explained by differences in geometry between the tools. There was a tendency for specific draught to increase with increased driving speed. This was most obvious on the lighter soil and for the mouldboard plough. The increased draught can be explained by a higher acceleration of soil particles and by increased soil strength because of higher deformation rate. Soil strength and thereby draught requirement differed between soils and moisture contents. There was a strong correlation between soil cohesion and draught requirement, and cohesion was easily measured in the field with a shear vane. The penetrometer measurements did not correlate with draught measurements. Specific draught was lowest for the mouldboard plough. When considering the overall results of tillage, no one implement can be identified as being the most effective. Tillage at water content close to the plastic limit seems to be a good compromise as regards draught requirement and tillage result...|$|R
40|$|Shober, AmyInefficient use of {{nitrogen}} (N) fertilizer in agronomic crop production {{can lead to}} water quality concerns and reduced yields for growers. Nitrogen left in the soil after crop harvest is subject to leaching losses to groundwater or gaseous losses to the atmosphere. Split additions of N via sidedressing or fertigation can better time N applications with corn N uptake and improve N use efficiency (NUE). Irrigation can also stabilize yields and raise NUE at decade time scales. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) quantify the effect of N rate and timing under central pivot irrigation on grain yield and N use efficiency in Delaware using a plot study and 2) investigate the impact of irrigation on yield and NUE in Delaware using historical yield data. A plot study was completed by establishing irrigated corn on well-drained soil which received zero N (control) or 6. 72 Mg ha- 1 poultry litter, 34 kg ha- 1 starter N at planting, and 0, 82, 140, or 198 kg ha- 1 of in-season N (applied at sidedress at V 5 or via fertigation at V 5, V 8, V 11, and V 13). Grain yield was determined for each treatment at harvest using a <b>weigh</b> wagon. Pre-plant <b>soil,</b> post-harvest grain, residue, and in-season soil samples were collected and analyzed to allow calculation of NUE by several methods. Nitrogen application rate affected yields and NUE more than N timing and application when in-season N was applied. Yields of irrigated corn were statistically similar at N rates exceeding 82 kg ha- 1; average yields over the study period were 17 Mg ha- 1. Partial factor productivity {{of nitrogen}} was above 60 kg kg- 1 for corn at all N rates except the highest rate. Total aboveground biomass for irrigated corn treatments receiving supplemental N generally contained more N in plant tissue (values ranged from 214 to 254 kg ha- 1) than Chesapeake Bay Model Scenario Builder (SB) maximum uptake estimates of 218 kg ha- 1. Mass balance estimates of NUE indicated that 13 to 49 % of available N applied to plots could not be unaccounted for in plant tissue or soils. The mass balance approach illustrated a trend for increasing unaccounted for N with increasing N rate but, this was only significant in 2014. Leachate concentrations of NO 3 -N at 60 cm depth were highest in plots receiving supplemental N, with mean concentrations of 7 and 22 mg L- 1 NO 3 -N in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Currently, irrigated land receives an interim credit of 4 % reduction in total N in the Chesapeake Bay Model. This reduction is modeled like a filter, where irrigated corn would release 4 % less N than comparable rainfed fields. Historical data from University of Delaware corn hybrid variety trials were analyzed to evaluate effects of irrigation on corn yields and NUE over time. Historical yield data and calculated NUE (from variety trials and UD field plot studies) were compared to values in the literature and those used by the Chesapeake Bay Program. In the last two decades, hybrid variety trials met and exceeded the 12. 5 Mg ha- 1 yield maximum value used in the Chesapeake Bay Model SB. Rainfed plots were 80 and 85 % as efficient as irrigated plots in converting applied N to grain yield over the 35 year history of UD corn variety trials. A scenario indicated that irrigated corn could consume 1, 030 Mg more N annually than rainfed plots if they were fertilized based on UD N rates for a realistic irrigated yield goal. Based on results of a two-year plot study at UD Warrington Irrigation Farm and analysis of 35 years of yield data from UD variety trials, we make the following preliminary recommendations: 1) lower UD N rate recommendations for high yielding irrigated corn by 15 % to account for increased NUE of irrigated corn and 2) Evaluate if irrigation’s NUE would be more appropriately modeled as a separate crop category or, as a BMP. Future research should focus providing data to further refine these recommendations by quantifying NUE at a regional scale. On-farm strip trials could be conducted by UD researchers with a common protocol at multiple locations to evaluate how NUE and yields are affected by irrigation and N management. In addition, we also recommend collection and analysis of leachate and groundwater samples as part of these strip trials to determine risk of N losses at different locations under various soil and management conditions.
