5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E
500|$|According to Nickson, Carey {{chose to}} express her {{innermost}} feelings in her songs rather than becoming depressed and bitter throughout the hardships in her life. [...] "You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say, `I'm proud of what I am and <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> I'm {{just going to be}} myself." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the context}} of the film, [...] "Listen" [...] is a 1975 song that Deena records on Rainbow Records, a {{recording}} empire established by Curtis. [...] She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property. Used in the film as a last-minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis [...] "to find her own voice as a newly independent woman", co-writer Anne Preven called [...] "Listen" [...] a song which [...] "Deena is exclaiming, 'You don't know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> I know I do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band have {{generally}} been {{considered one of the}} pioneering bands in Southern rock, although the group distanced themselves from the term. Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: [...] "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South. I'm damned proud of <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> where I'm from, but I hate the term 'Southern rock.' I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don’t think are fair." ...|$|E
500|$|The role made Papps a {{favourite}} {{with the}} viewers, won him many fans {{and made him}} famous. The Seven Network received fan mail for Papps before the series even debuted. While interviewed in 1989, Papps explained {{that he would never}} admit to being the [...] "sex symbol" [...] that he was labelled as. He thought it was [...] "nice to be loved and accepted" [...] but the fame the role generated became an [...] "intrusion" [...] on his privacy. He told TVTimes Power that he could not relate to the perception of him and added [...] "I know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> I'm not the person hyped out there".|$|E

500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{working with}} Stewart and The-Dream, Lopez stated that: [...] "What I love about great {{producers}} and writers {{is that they}} can take you and transport you right into this moment, but not change you. And that's what I feel like Tricky and Dream did with this record. They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still {{very much a part of}} <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> will always be, and they put it right there on that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody. Shetler particularly noted the lyric [...] "Our love could run the world" [...] as a good example of the optimism in the song.|$|E

500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> I will {{continue}} to be."

I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Green Day {{began to}} write new songs for what would become 21st Century Breakdown in January 2006 after touring {{extensively}} in 2005 in support of their seventh studio album American Idiot. At the time, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong stated: [...] "We'll start with silence, and that's how we'll {{be able to find}} the inspiration to find another record." [...] The band did not release any details of the writing and recording process until October 2007, when Armstrong {{said in an interview with}} Rolling Stone that he had written [...] "something like 45 songs". The band members worked on the primitive conceptual stages of the album at their rehearsal studio in Oakland, California. Little was revealed on the themes or musical style of the album, but Armstrong stated: [...] "I want to dig into <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> what I'm feeling at this moment – which is middle-aged." [...] He added that many of the 45 songs were written on piano rather than guitar.|$|E
500|$|Lauren is {{the most}} famous {{basketball}} player in Australia, a position she reached by 2003. [...] Prior to this, Australia's most famous player was Michelle Timms, Australia's first player of either gender to play internationally. [...] She was recognised {{as one of the}} world's best basketball players {{by the time she was}} 21. [...] She has been described as Australia's answer to Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal, and the best female basketball player in the world. [...] She has said regarding being the best female basketball player in the world: [...] "I don't really think about it. Nobody really talks to me like that. It's not something I'm conscious of. My family and people who have known me all my life, they see me for <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> crack open a beer or a bottle of wine with me. They know I have to train, but the rest of it is really laid-back." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Dancing With Myself" [...] is McHale's {{first solo}} {{performance}} on the show. Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to [...] "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" [...] and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually [...] "a very secure guy" [...] who does not care about others' opinions of him, [...] "Wheels" [...] sees his friends take his disability for granted: [...] "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> this is who I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am {{to be able to get}} up between each take and walk around. I'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> what I do and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now. She continued {{to do well in}} Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.|$|E
500|$|Britney {{incorporates}} pop styles {{with elements}} of dance-pop and R. The album opens with its lead single [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". The song features an urban influence and Middle Eastern flavor, amid breathy, emotive noises, {{and it has}} been compared to [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] by Vanity 6. Spears commented that its lyrics are [...] "about me just wanting to go out and forget <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> dance and have a good time". [...] "Overprotected" [...] was noted for having Europop styles, and addresses a girl who is tired of being manipulated. Lyrically, [...] "Lonely" [...] sees a girl moving on from a troublesome romance after being lied to and manipulated. It was considered [...] "a teenage version of Janet's [...] "What About?". The soft rock piano ballad [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", co-penned by English singer-songwriter Dido, Max Martin and Rami, details the emotional struggles that teenage girls experience during puberty. [...] "Boys" [...] incorporates R and hip hop styles, and was criticized by David Browne of Entertainment Weekly as [...] "cut-rate '80s Janet Jackson". The disco-inspired track [...] "Anticipating" [...] discusses the friendship and camaraderie between women, and it's reminiscent of [...] 'Holiday' or Kylie in disco mood." ...|$|E

6000|$|Directly I {{arrived here}} I sought out Mrs. Pickett, {{explained}} [...] <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> requested her to furnish me with any further [...] information {{which might be}} of service to me.

6000|$|... "She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could {{understand}} some few syllables {{that she said}} to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told her; <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told her. It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.|$|R
500|$|Jam and Lewis {{were the}} primary instrumentalists for the recording, {{including}} percussion, piano, drums, and also provided background vocals. Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements. Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology, stating [...] "...technology has altered the form, shape, scale and even the meaning of popular music... The album wasn't created by a studio band, as were most pop-rock albums in the 1960s and '70s, but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures." [...] Jackson's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control, claiming it would never sell. In a cover story for Spin magazine titled [...] "Damn It, Janet: The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson," [...] Joseph was reported saying [...] "f Janet listens to me, she'll {{be as big as}} Michael." [...] She and McClain disregarded his objections. Commenting on the final product, Jackson stated: [...] "It's aggressive, cocky, very forward. It expresses exactly <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> how I feel. I've taken control of my own life. This time I'm gonna do it my way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "WOW" [...] is an {{industrial}} dance song, and Manson has {{described it as}} a turning point for the album, explaining: [...] "The first half of the record is kind of bitter and angry, but there's a confidence that starts to rebuild itself [...] I wanted to do a song that represented <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> why I started doing this in the first place." [...] Manson plays a one-stringed guitar on the song, which also features the sound of him [...] "snorting lines of something - whatever it might have been - as a percussion instrument." [...] In a review of the leaked demo, which was originally titled [...] "The WoW", James Gill of Metal Hammer described it as [...] "genuinely filthy and intensely sexy. [...] It doesn't have anything in the way of memorable hooks, but it's the sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth strip club... if one existed." [...] "Wight Spider" [...] is one of the heaviest songs on the album, and has been compared to the work of Mastodon. Metal Hammer also said of the track: [...] "whether conscious or not, what [...] learned from Trent Reznor is back: the track builds and builds without changing direction." [...] "Unkillable Monster" [...] is a down-tempo rock song which alternates between a quiet-verse and loud-chorus structure, and features layered, distorted vocals and guitars.|$|E

60|$|I walked {{sometimes}} in the Mall with my woman Amy, but I kept no company and made no acquaintances, only made as gay a show as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to do, and that upon all occasions.
