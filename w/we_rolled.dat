500|$|Adams finger billiards and {{exhibition}} work had its germination {{in his early}} bowling interest. By {{the time he was}} 17, Adams was an adept bowler; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as [...] "cocked hat", [...] "back frame", and letting the head pin remain standing. In a 1913 interview, Adams said that, [...] "n those days <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the [...] put on a cue ball in Billiards." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce and Utsler did {{not expect}} many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were {{surprised}} when thousands of people chanted [...] "I-C-P! I-C-P!" [...] {{as they waited for}} the group to perform. Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay $2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage. Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to [...] "give something back." [...] According to Bruce, [...] "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea." [...] Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.|$|E

The fragment documenting this contains only {{a description of the}} scenic valley, but the village was home to Petrarch, who famously described his two gardens there: one created by the river and its cliffs, for admiration and inspiration, but inaccessible; the other near his house beside the river, where ... art surmounts nature ... and where he ... gathered the labourers, the fishermen and the shepherds; <b>we</b> <b>rolled</b> giant stones, built up a fortification against the Nymphs (that is, the river in spate), we carved out an altar for the Muses; soon we could see the Helicon, Parnassus, the Hippocrene; and we planted the forest of the poets.|$|E
