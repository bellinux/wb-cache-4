500|$|A Full Scale arcade {{version was}} {{released}} alongside the standard arcade version in 1993. This version {{was designed to}} give the player a more realistic driving experience. Players (a passenger could sit in the car next to the driver) sat inside an adapted red Eunos Roadster, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and controlled the same car on-screen. The game was played {{in front of a}} [...] wide, front-projected triple screen (which benefited from dimmed ambient lighting), with the <b>wheel,</b> <b>gear</b> stick and pedals functioning as the controls. The ignition key was used to start, the speed and RPM gauges were functional, and fans blew wind on the player from inside the air vents. Speakers concealed inside the car provided realistic engine and tyre sounds; overhead speakers provided surround music. The P.C.B. was located under the bonnet of the car.|$|E

2500|$|The V3 third {{prototype}} airframe, {{with the}} code PC+UC, became a true jet when it flew on 18 July 1942 in Leipheim near Günzburg, Germany, piloted by [...] test pilot Fritz Wendel. This was almost nine months {{ahead of the}} British Gloster Meteor's first flight on 5 March 1943. Its retracting conventional tail <b>wheel</b> <b>gear</b> (similar to other contemporary piston powered propeller aircraft), a feature shared with the first four Me 262 V-series airframes, caused its jet exhaust to deflect off the runway, with the wing's turbulence negating {{the effects of the}} elevators, and the first takeoff attempt was cut short.|$|E
2500|$|The A-4 engined Potez VIII first flew on 19 April 1920. When {{its engine}} was {{recognised}} {{as a failure}} the A-4 {{was replaced by a}} six-cylinder Anzani radial engine, mounted uncowled in the nose. An early version produced [...] and a later variant [...] [...] Initially the four wheel undercarriage was retained but when the Potez VIII appeared at the 1922 Paris Salon it had more conventional two <b>wheel</b> <b>gear.</b> The wheels were on a single axle. From each end of the axle a strut ran to the underside of the forward fuselage, acting together with a vertical telescopic, rubber damped shock absorber. At least one example flew as a floatplane, designated Potez VIII H (H for hydravion or water plane). It had a single, central float and a small, airfoil section stabilizing float under each wing.|$|E

Additionally, these shapes have a low pressure drop which is advantageous for this application.|$|R
60|$|His bicycle was {{now very}} old, {{and it is}} one of the concomitants of a bicycle's {{senility}} that its free wheel should one day obstinately cease to be free. It corresponds to that epoch in human decay when an old gentleman loses an incisor tooth. It happened just as Mr. Polly was approaching Mr. Rusper's shop, and the untoward chance of a motor car trying to pass a waggon on the wrong side gave Mr. Polly no choice but to get on to the pavement and dismount. He was always accustomed to take his time and step off his left pedal at its lowest point, but the jamming of the free <b>wheel</b> <b>gear</b> made that lowest moment a transitory one, and the pedal was lifting his foot for another revolution before he realised what had happened. Before he could dismount according to his habit the pedal had to make a revolution, and before it could make a revolution Mr. Polly found himself among the various sonorous things with which Mr. Rusper adorned the front of his shop, zinc dustbins, household pails, lawn mowers, rakes, spades and all manner of clattering things. Before he got among them he had one of those agonising moments of helpless wrath and suspense that seem to last ages, in which one seems to perceive everything and think of nothing but words that are better forgotten. He sent a column of pails thundering across the doorway and dismounted with one foot in a sanitary dustbin amidst an enormous uproar of falling ironmongery.|$|E
