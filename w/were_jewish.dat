5|$|Beginning in the 1920, and {{continuing}} until the 1960s, McGill imposed a controversial quota which specified a maximum on {{the proportion of}} newly admitted students who <b>were</b> <b>Jewish.</b> Up until that point Jews had been overrepresented in the university, especially in the arts (20% Jewish) and law (40% Jewish). The quota limited the Jewish population across McGill to at most 10%.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Emperor, Domitian's {{role in the}} Flavian government was largely ceremonial. In June 71, Titus returned triumphant {{from the war in}} Judaea. Ultimately, the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people, a majority of whom <b>were</b> <b>Jewish.</b> The city and temple of Jerusalem were completely destroyed, its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army, and nearly 100,000 people were captured and enslaved.|$|E

His parents <b>were</b> <b>Jewish</b> Romanians who reportedly spoke Yiddish as their first language; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business. Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, née Zibalis. Owing to the Romanian Kingdom's discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not emancipated, and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.|$|E

His parents, Andrea and Herbert – both of whom <b>were</b> <b>Jewish</b> – {{had been unable to}} {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth.

While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

50|$|In the Orthodox <b>Jewish</b> {{community}} there <b>is</b> {{no consensus}} {{as to whether}} an egg donor needs to <b>be</b> <b>Jewish</b> {{in order for the}} child to <b>be</b> considered <b>Jewish</b> from birth. In the 1990s religious authorities said that if the birth mother <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> that the child would <b>be</b> <b>Jewish</b> as well, but {{in the past few years}} rabbis in Israel have begun to reconsider, which in turn is causing more debate around the world. Conservative Rabbi Elliot Dorff has suggested that there are arguments for both sides (birth mother or genetic mother) in religious scripture. Dean of the Center for the Jewish Future at Yeshiva University believes that any child where the birth mother or the genetic mother isn't Jewish should go through a conversion process in infancy, to be sure that their Judaism isn't questioned later in life. This is not an issue in the reform community for two reasons. First, only one parent must <b>be</b> <b>Jewish</b> for the child to be considered Jewish; thus, if the father <b>is</b> <b>Jewish,</b> the mother's religion is irrelevant. Second, if the mother who carries the pregnancy and gives birth <b>is</b> <b>Jewish,</b> reform Jews will generally consider that child to <b>be</b> <b>Jewish</b> from birth because it was born of a Jewish mother.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding <b>were</b> <b>Jewish,</b> including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, most of whom <b>were</b> <b>Jewish.</b> The small group of Latvians who {{became involved in the}} events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
5|$|Connelly {{was born}} in Cairo, New York, in the Catskill Mountains. She is the {{daughter}} of Ilene, an antiques dealer, and Gerard Karl Connelly (1941–2008), a clothing manufacturer. Her father was Roman Catholic, and of Irish and Norwegian descent. Connelly's mother was Jewish, and was educated at a yeshiva; all of Connelly's mother's grandparents <b>were</b> <b>Jewish</b> emigrants from Poland and Russia. Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights, near the Brooklyn Bridge, where she attended Saint Ann's, a private school specializing in the Arts. Her father suffered from asthma, so the family moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1976 to escape the city smog. Four years later, the family returned to Brooklyn Heights, and Connelly returned to Saint Ann's.|$|E
