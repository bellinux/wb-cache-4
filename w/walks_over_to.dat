5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Ram Jam {{was started}} by the Alumni Association in 2003 and has grown to become the large pregame football tailgating parties they are today. During the fall semester outside the Legrand Alumni Center, students, alumni, and community members park their cars {{in the parking lot}} and hang out around the center to grill and socialize. The events also feature local bands to provide entertainment, free food and refreshments, bounce houses and other games for kids, and alcoholic beverages for those 21 and up. The Ram Band, the ASU dance team, the Angelettes, and the ASU Cheerleaders also perform and everyone <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the stadium prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{vision of}} The Giant ends, {{replaced}} by the singer and band. The old waiter <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Cooper and says, [...] "I'm so sorry." [...] Donna begins to sob. James comforts her, to no avail. Bobby Briggs turns from the bar, overcome by sadness as well. Cooper stares out, bewildered, as the band repeats a melancholy refrain.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{contacted}} Chris Applebaum {{to direct}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", with ideologies for the video already conceived. Her ideas for the video's theme were about [...] "high-gloss, glamorous white trash." [...] She told Applebaum she desired {{to pay tribute to}} one of her favorite films, Grease (1978), and her parents' courting days. Video conception sprang forward with the idea to resemble the scene in Grease where John Travolta sings [...] "Sandy". In the scene, Travolta exits from a car and <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a jungle gym, where he sits on a swing and performs the song as projections are displayed in the background. To render homage to her parents' courting days, Cyrus and Applebaum named a drive-in theater in the video Corral Drive-In after a Kentucky drive-in where Cyrus' parents had a date. [...] "In addition, Miley's mom Tish used to drive '79 black Pontiac Trans Am, Smokey and the Bandit (1977) style, and obviously that's the car that Miley arrives in," [...] Applebaum said.|$|E
500|$|During the bridge, Stefani {{walks into}} a dark room with five female figures wearing masks of her face. After {{intentionally}} bumping into two of them, she puts on a multi-colored poncho and rides a motorcycle with other women. During the third chorus, she changes into a long, white skirt reminiscent of a wedding gown and enters Blake's, a piano lounge (another reference to Shelton). Stefani stands at the bar, where bartender Todrick Hall pretends to mix drinks and wipe the counter. A background dancer picks her up and swings her in a circle, while others also dance. Stefani <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a piano and lip-syncs the song's bridge, while members of the production crew replace her high heels with roller skates. Entering a bullseye-shaped room, she skates through the chorus; her stunt double [...] "falls", which surprises the other skaters. The video ends with Stefani, on a platform, lip-syncing the final words of the song; the camera pulls out, displaying the Target logo and red confetti falling from the studio ceiling.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} verse, Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces, some joyful {{while others are}} more tense as Lewis is sad. The couple are then seen leaving the party; Haynes <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Lewis and attempts to kiss, but she proceeds to push him away. During the second airing of the chorus, more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept on the sofa. More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears. At the breakfast that follows, the couple break {{into a series of}} arguments. Lewis shoves Haynes onto the sofa, and Haynes grabs Lewis as she turns away. Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face. During the middle eight breakdown in the song, [...] Haynes throws books from a shelf, and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion, as well as pushing over a lamp. Haynes subsequently leaves, driving away into the distance, and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Boys" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers. In the video, a man DJ Qualls, tries {{to get into a}} castle which is hosting a party being attended by Spears. When the security guards refuse to grant him access, he begins to scream for Spears. As the music starts, Spears, readying herself for the party in one of the castle's towers, is dancing with a group of women. The scene shifts to a castle courtyard, where Spears and a man are sit at opposite ends of a long table. Following this, Spears walks around a pool, in which she sees a man (Justin Bruening) swimming. As they begin to interact with each other, Pharrell is at the bar with a woman. Spears <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him and they begin to talk. Following this, Spears dances with a group of people, including Mike Myers as Austin Powers. Actors Jason Priestley, Justin Bruening and Taye Diggs also make cameo appearances in the video. Its choreography was favorably likened to Janet Jackson. The video was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Video from a Film, but lost to Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson {{lounging}} in her bed. Upset by her partner, she <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the closet and}} rips down all of his clothes. The video then cuts to Hilson {{sitting in a chair}} at a beauty salon, where she gets a new haircut and dyes her hair from black to blonde. She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes". On the other hand, Robbie Daw of Idolator deemed it tiresome, calling it a [...] "visual snoozefest". He wrote, [...] " [...] goes to a salon, orders up Rihanna's Rated R haircut and sasses men who are wrongin' the ladies. Hey, girls—her love has a limit! But so does our patience for this [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "red reality", {{two police}} {{officers}} are sitting in a car talking when they receive a report of a break-in at a local college swimming pool. They see Michael running naked from the pool and chase him; when they tell him to stop running, Michael identifies himself as a detective. Meanwhile, in the [...] "green reality", Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) exits his house and makes a phone call. Marcus then <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his car and tries to start it, but notices a bomb in the car's engine and runs away shortly before it explodes. Soon after, at the police station, Michael and Bird tell Marcus that they will protect him. Marcus' wife, Alina (Ayelet Zurer), comes into the station, where Marcus explains what has happened. Shortly after talking with Marcus and Alina, Michael and Bird take the couple to a hotel for temporary shelter. In the [...] "red reality", Michael notices Hannah cleaning up and packing items before they move to Oregon.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up and <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{a man who is}} kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes. But sorry for my misbehavior guys I reacted so fast because the fact I gave him a past [...] many times and every single time there was excuses. Sometimes it sucks waiting on somebody else time to get what they promised you, if you said a specific day & time for my money than I want my stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zsa Zsa {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the {{barriers}} at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does. They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter if he knows Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), saying they go back a long way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk.

2500|$|The first 16 {{episodes of}} the fifth series begin with Peel {{receiving}} a call-to-duty message from Steed: [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed." [...] Peel was conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The messages were delivered by Steed in increasingly bizarre ways as the series progressed: in a newspaper Peel had just bought, or on traffic lights while she was out driving. On one occasion Steed appeared on her television set, interrupting an old science-fiction movie (actually clips from the series four episode [...] "The Cybernauts") to call her to work. Another way Steed contacted her was {{in the beginning of}} episode 13, [...] "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station" [...] when she enters her flat and sees a Meccano Percy the Small Engine going around a circular track with a note on one of the train cars that says [...] "Mrs. Peel" [...] in bold letters, she then <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Steed who says, [...] "You're needed." [...] At the start of [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] Peel is redecorating her apartment (wearing a jumpsuit and drinking champagne); she peels off a strip of wallpaper, revealing the words [...] "Mrs Peel" [...] painted on the wall beneath. She turns to see Steed in the apartment removing another strip of wallpaper, revealing [...] "We're needed" [...] painted underneath on another wall. In another instance Emma enters Steed's flat to find he has just fallen down the stairs, and he painfully gasps, [...] "Mrs Peel, you're needed." [...] Often the episode's tag scene returned to the situation of the [...] "Mrs Peel, we're needed" [...] scene. [...] "The Hidden Tiger" [...] returns to the partially redecorated apartment where Steed begins painting a love heart and arrow and the initials of two people on the wall, but paints over the initials when Peel sees his graffito. In [...] "The Superlative Seven" [...] the call to duty and the tag both involve a duck shooting situation where unexpected items fall from the sky after shots are fired.|$|E
