2500|$|Game {{journalist}} Geoff Keighley, who {{had been}} in discussions with Murray and Hello Games throughout the development, had expressed concern to Murray in the year leading up to release, according to Keighley in September 2016. He said he was [...] "internally conflicted" [...] {{about the state of the}} game near its release, recognising that many of the features that Murray had been talking about were not going to make it, and compared Murray to Peter Molyneux who had overpromised on a vision for his games that ultimately fell short. Keighley had expressed to Murray his concern that the $60 price tag was a bit steep for the current state of the game and recommended that they take an early access approach instead. According to Keighley, Murray said he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>around</b> Keighley any more as he was [...] "a little too negative about the game and 's assessment of where the team was at". Keighley felt that Murray could not [...] "rip off that band-aid" [...] and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to [...] "disrespect his audience". As such, Keighley sympathised with those that felt they were misled by the marketing. Keighley rekindled the relationship with Murray since launch, and anticipated discussing more of what happened near release with him.
