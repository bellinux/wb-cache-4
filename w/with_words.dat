5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent <b>with</b> <b>words</b> of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in Baudhayana Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others <b>with</b> <b>words,</b> thoughts or acts is named Adrohi).|$|E

5|$|Armenian {{geographic}} {{names were}} first changed under {{the reign of}} Sultan Abdulhamit II. In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced <b>with</b> <b>words</b> like Anatolia or Kurdistan. Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E
5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates. The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between {{the creation of a}} poem <b>with</b> <b>words,</b> and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's most {{enduring}} orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. Also in 1870, Sullivan met Gilbert. 1871 was a busy year for Sullivan. He published his only song cycle, The Window; or, The Songs of the Wrens, to words by Tennyson, {{and he wrote}} {{the first of a}} series of suites of incidental music for West End productions of Shakespeare plays. Still in 1871, Sullivan composed a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea, for the opening of the London International Exhibition, and the hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers, <b>with</b> <b>words</b> by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan's {{most enduring}} hymn.|$|E

5|$|The Opies {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of pax. In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds <b>with</b> <b>words</b> used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were barley, fainites, kings, crosses, keys, skinch, cree and scribs.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's choral {{works for}} concert {{performance}} include settings of both {{secular and religious}} words. The former include Toward the Unknown Region to words by Whitman (composed 1904–06), Five Tudor Portraits, words by John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean Serenade to Music (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1923–25) and the Christmas cantata Hodie (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works Sancta Civitas was his favourite. The Dona Nobis Pacem, an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) {{is a combination of}} both, <b>with</b> <b>words</b> from Whitman and others juxtaposed with extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten's War Requiem twenty-five years later.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated <b>with</b> <b>words.</b> Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders <b>with</b> <b>words,</b> the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} <b>with</b> <b>words.</b> The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
