5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E

Callas staged {{a series of}} joint {{recitals}} in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically, this was a musical disaster owing to both performers' worn-out voices. However, the tour was an enormous popular success.

25|$|The poem is {{seventeen}} lines long. It {{is divided}} into two sections which are easily distinguishable from each other; lines 1-14 are a simple description of the horrors of the landscape of battle, while lines 15-17 are a declaration of the meaninglessness of the sacrifice that war requires. The theme of premature death is built into the structure of the poem itself, as lines 1-11 have four stresses, lines 12 through 15 has five or six stresses. This climaxes in line 16, which is the longest in the poem at 17 syllables, and is immediately followed by the shortest line in the poem, at 7 syllables. The abrupt shortening from line 16 to 17 is suggestive of the abrupt death of young men who were in the prime of life and <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much potential left.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of Gustav Eriksson as a regent made many Swedish nobles, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far stayed loyal to King Christian, switch sides. Some noblemen, still {{loyal to the}} king, chose to leave Sweden, while others were killed. As a result, the Swedish Privy Council lost old members who were replaced by supporters of Gustav Eriksson. Most fortified cities and castles were conquered by Gustav's rebels, but the strongholds with the best defences, including Stockholm, were still under Danish control. In 1522, after negotiations between Gustav Eriksson's people and Lübeck, the Hanseatic city joined the war against Denmark. The winter of 1523 saw the joint forces attack the Danish and Norwegian areas of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bohuslän. During this winter, Christian II was overthrown and replaced by Frederick I. The new king openly claimed the Swedish throne and had hopes Lübeck would abandon the Swedish rebels. The German city, preferring an independent Sweden to a strong Kalmar Union dominated by Denmark, {{took advantage of the}} situation and put pressure on the rebels. The city wanted privileges on future trade as well as guarantees regarding the loans they had granted the rebels. The Privy Council and Gustav Eriksson knew the support from Lübeck was absolutely crucial. As a response, the council decided to appoint Gustav Eriksson king.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, Bianca is {{raped by}} Michael. She internalizes her rage and only tells Maggie, but {{eventually}} the entire town of Pine Valley learns the truth, which brings Bianca and her estranged mother closer. Michael is charged with rape but, to the town's outrage, he is acquitted. When Bianca discovers she is pregnant {{as a result of}} rape, Kendall, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often scorned Bianca in their past, unconditionally supports her sister and does not give an opinion on Bianca's choices. Michael disappears and Kendall announces she has married her sister's rapist, who shortly turns up dead with Kendall having become the primary suspect in his murder. When Bianca tells Kendall she is keeping her baby, also inspired by Kendall being part of her life, Kendall helps her sister and, with Maggie and Lena's help, aids her in hiding her pregnancy from everyone, including Erica. Kendall announces she is pregnant by Michael, which is also used by her lawyers to help avoid a murder charge and Bianca helps Kendall fake the pregnancy. Bianca and Kendall's ruse is aided by Dr. David Hayward, Ryan Lavery, Lena, Maggie, Reggie Montgomery, and Jackson. The truth eventually comes out that Bianca is the killer but blocked it out and that Kendall, with Reggie's help, worked to cover it up in an effort to protect Bianca; Bianca shot Michael in self-defense but the trauma of her rape led to her repressing the memory. After hearing Bianca's confession, the judge presiding over the case leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her.|$|E

500|$|Walton's first {{successful}} large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is {{in marked contrast}} to the raucous Portsmouth Point; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto. In this work, wrote Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor in The Record Guide, [...] "the lyric poet in Walton, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far been hidden under a mask of irony, fully emerged." [...] Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.|$|E

500|$|In his memoirs, written {{more than}} thirty years after her death, her father wrote of Elisabeth's [...] "deep sensitivity" [...] and [...] "very large heart." [...] He wrote that [...] "I never knew a child <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much {{influence}} on adults. Her inner personality was very strong, and she had a natural quality that protected her from being spoiled." [...] In October 1901, after the death of Queen Victoria, Elisabeth's parents finally divorced. Her mother had rekindled a previous romance with another cousin, her future husband, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia. Her father, according to letters written by her mother, had been caught cavorting with domestic servants. Her parents' divorce meant that Elisabeth divided her year between Darmstadt and her mother's new home in Coburg. Elisabeth was at first mistrustful of her mother and resented the divorce, although Victoria did her best to mend her relationship with her daughter during her visit with Elisabeth in the spring of 1902. She was only partially successful, though Victoria enjoyed turning her daughter into an outstanding horsewoman.|$|E

500|$|In The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide (1985), Goin' Home {{was given}} five stars and called [...] "particularly heartfelt". In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, jazz critic Scott Yanow gave it four-and-a-half stars {{and found the}} performances [...] "compelling". He said listeners who are [...] "only familiar with Shepp's earlier Fire Music" [...] will see the album as a [...] "revelation." [...] Moon believed its tempoless mood [...] "gives the themes an extra shot of majesty" [...] and found it [...] "supremely melodic", writing that both Shepp and Parlan [...] "do {{whatever is necessary to}} bring the spirit to the forefront." [...] Richard Cook gave it four out of four stars in The Penguin Guide to Jazz (2002). JazzTimes cited Goin' Home as one of [...] "the finest [...] of his career", and Tom Hull of The Village Voice cited it as SteepleChase's best release. Phil Johnson of The Independent wrote that the album [...] "can be listened to almost without cease." [...] Jazz historian Eric Nisenson called it [...] "one of the most moving albums of the Seventies", but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp, an iconic figure in free jazz, [...] "was no longer the firebrand <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> frightened and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans." [...] Nisenson felt that, like Pharoah Sanders, Shepp's [...] "trial by fire {{at the heart of the}} Sixties avant-garde had made him an unusually expressive musician," [...] and Goin' Home showed that he was [...] "finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition." ...|$|E

2500|$|The manuscripts {{give the}} title of the work as Vita Cypriani ("The Life of Cyprian"), while Jerome (see above) {{referred}} to it as Vita et passio Cypriani ("Life and martyrdom of Cyprian"). Jerome's reference may not be intended as a title; but it is certainly the case that the book is clearly divided into two parts, one concerned with Cyprian's life, one with the events leading up to his martyrdom. [...] In the preface to the work, Pontius expresses regret there were detailed accounts of the martyrdoms of lay Christians, but none of a bishop like Cyprian <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much worth narrating even without the martyrdom (1, 2). Chapters 3 to 10 relate Cyprian's activities from the time of his conversion, while chapters 11-19 describe proceedings before two different proconsuls, their judgements and Cyprian's final martyrdom.|$|E

A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: [...] "Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface.

[...] He had been lucky not to be called up for the Korean War in the early 1950s or the Suez Crisis in 1956 but in the final years of National Service, already due for abolition by 1960, an effort was made to call up men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far managed to postpone service.

2500|$|Many of the Seimeni fraternized {{with the}} enemy, leaving the pretender {{to collect his}} {{remaining}} troops, and, though continuously harassed by Transylvanian pursuers, to seek his way toward Brăila, in Ottoman territory. This allowed Constantin to leave Silistra and seek to join the Transylvanian–Moldavian troops, which he did at Dridov; on his way there, he intercepted and executed several Seimeni, marking {{the beginning of a}} major purge. As Filipescu writes: [...] "the Seimeni discarded their blue clothes and dressed up in messy rags, and swore that they were not soldiers, for whoever was known to be one had no more days left to live." [...] Nevertheless, resistance continued: more skirmishes were recorded outside Bucharest, Brăila, and Craiova; two months later, 2,000 cavalry regulars, or Călărași, also revolted, facing the loyalists outside Călugăreni. Xenopol describes this later revolt as another plot by the Seimeni, centered on [...] "butchering the Hungarians, and on toppling the Prince <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> gravely betrayed them." [...] They won a tactical victory against the Transylvanian regiment of János Boros (Borăș), before being put down by the Moldavians. Also on the loyalist side, the civil war involved a group of Crimean Tatars under Rüstem Mirza, who entered Wallachia in late June.
