30|$|The wings must, at minimum, be {{supported}} at three locations, two at A and B and a third, “offset,” <b>wing</b> support <b>bearing</b> {{along the line}} AC. In this configuration, the <b>wing</b> support <b>bearings</b> must primarily accommodate rotation, but also some translation. The need for translation {{is caused by the}} fact that paths ADB* and AD*B* in Fig.  6 b are not the same length. One <b>wing</b> support <b>bearing</b> (e.g., the one at A) should be fixed against longitudinal and transverse displacements. The one at B* should then be guided, permitting free longitudinal but not transverse displacement. The offset <b>wing</b> support <b>bearing,</b> along the line AC, must be designed for rotation about the line AC and for some longitudinal and transverse displacement to accommodate possible yaw motions.|$|R

5000|$|By far {{the strangest}} Baby was one {{modified}} by H.G. Leigh in 1920. The original wings were removed and instead the aircraft had a short, conventional, shoulder-mounted <b>wing,</b> <b>bearing</b> projecting, full-span ailerons. Above {{it was a}} strongly forward-staggered stack of six very narrow-chord wings of about the same span as the lower wing, hence each of very high aspect ratio and therefore with low induced drag.

5000|$|The SN.2 was {{powered by}} a [...] BMW X five {{cylinder}} radial engine mounted with its cylinder heads projecting through a domed cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided with the pilot under the wing leading edge in an enclosed single seat cabin. Aft, the central, <b>wing</b> <b>bearing</b> section behind the fixed wing trailing edge dropped away to a five sided structure with a ridged upper surface. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a roughly semi-circular tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, a little ahead of a similarly shaped fin. Both fixed surfaces carried broad, unbalanced control surfaces, with the rudder, which extended to the keel, operating within an elevator cut-out.|$|E

5000|$|The crest is a dragon's <b>wing</b> <b>bearing</b> {{the cross}} of St George, borne upon a peer's helmet. A {{primitive}} {{form of the}} crest first appeared in 1539 on the reverse of a new common seal. This showed a fan-like object bearing a cross. Over time this evolved into a dragon's wing, and was shown as such in 1633 when it appeared above the city's coat of arms in the frontispiece to the fourth edition of John Stow's Survey of London. The wing is specified as a dragon's left wing, i.e. its proper left wing (which {{can be compared to}} heraldic left). It has been speculated that the use of a peer's helmet (rather than that of a gentleman, in other civic arms) relates {{to the use of the}} honorific prefix [...] "The Right Honourable" [...] by the Lord Mayor. The helm was confirmed in 1957. However, there are various representations of the arms being surmounted by a 'Muscovy Hat' as worn by the City Swordbearer over the Stuart and Georgian period most notably as carved on the George Dance Porch of the Guildhall.|$|E
50|$|Air Guardian: The air guardian's {{appearance}} suits {{her role}} as the guardian of air. Her home is in a floating castle high above Perathia. She has {{the appearance of a}} black elemental with huge fins on her head (much similar to the water guardian) and she sports a slithering black tail and two pairs of <b>wings</b> <b>bearing</b> the symbol of air. The way to defeat her is much {{similar to that of the}} fire guardian, but instead of fire, the player may use any power in the axion to stop her. Her attacks are more varied as she can strike with her tail, create little tornadoes, summon wind elements, disappear and reappear from lightning, creating copies of herself, and shooting blasts of wind to hurt Azurik.|$|R

The pronotum is tectiform, with an hour-glass shaped pattern on the dorsum. The wings extend clearly beyond the abdomen, the hind <b>wings</b> <b>bearing</b> a black, curved bar running from the front to the back with only a very slight interruption. This is the easiest character distinguishing this species from related ones found in the same distribution area. The bar of O. nigeriensis has a large gap in the middle, while the one of O. johnstoni is only present on the posterior part of the wing.|$|R

5000|$|San Jacinto Mall {{opened its}} doors in 1981. At the time, the mall was {{relatively}} large for the immediate market area but nonetheless successful in the beginning. It had four large wings, shaped much like two overlapping [...] "L's". In the central area of the mall was a JCPenney and the food court coined [...] "The Market". The other wings each had one anchor and one junior anchor: a northwest wing, originally anchorless until Mervyns filled the vacant pad in the early 80's, along with a HJ Wilson Catalog Showroom as junior anchor, a southwest wing with Foley's and Palais Royal as junior anchor, a southeast wing with Montgomery Ward and junior anchor Bealls, and a northeast <b>wing</b> <b>bearing</b> a Sears and junior anchor The Fair. Over the years, the mall primarily had trouble competing with the many new, big box stores that had sprung up along Garth Road, south of the mall, in Baytown. Service Merchandise and Montgomery Ward closed in 2001 (both due to a countrywide company liquidation). Bealls also vacated the same year. These anchors have never been retenanted. The next major loss happened in early 2006, when Mervyns closed all Houston area stores. In addition to the southeast wing, the northwest wing of the mall was also now anchorless. Soon after, a proposal was rendered by NewQuest Properties to demolish both the southeast wing (former Bealls/Wards) and northwest wing (former Mervyns/SM) and transform them into [...] "lifestyle" [...] additions. Foley's was rebranded as Macy's in September 2006. In November 2006, Triyar Cos. LLC, owned by the Yari family, put the mall and several other Greater Houston malls for sale; the company allowed a buyer to either buy an individual property, or buy all of them at once. As of January 2014, demolition of the two wings and construction of the [...] "lifestyle" [...] additions had yet to commence and {{it is unclear whether}} this proposal is still being considered or if it has been shelved. It was reported on July 16, 2015, that a sale of the mall to Fidelis Realty Partners had been finalized. The mall will be redesigned to an open air complex with the original anchor stores. The project will take three years to complete. http://baytownsun.com/news/article_32d5bb8c-2b6b-11e5-9c4b-07647dbde1a8.html ...|$|E

40|$|Aspects of the nymphal/adult {{developmental}} change {{were investigated}} in biometric studies of {{several species of}} Plecoptera: Nemouridae near Schlitz, Hesse, Germany. Preliminary information on the mayfly, Baetis vernus Curtis, is also provided. Nemourid nymphs pass through 3 <b>wing</b> <b>bearing</b> stages before reaching adulthood. Instars can be identified by their characteristic shapes, as expressed by the wing length/head width (WL/HW) ratio. Size does not allow instar discrimination, mainly due to sexual size differences. HW is ca 10 % larger in last instar female than in male nemourid nymphs; exuviae shed at the moult to adult represent about 14 % of nymphal ash free dry weight (AFDW). Biomass lost with exuviae during the many larval moults should be accounted for in estimates of production. Freshly emerged nemourid females are about 6 % larger and 30 % heavier than males. The HW/AFDW relationship is the same in both sexes. Through terrestrial feeding during adult life, males double their weight on average. Mature females are up to three times heavier than freshly emerged ones. They invest about 30 % of their final AFDW in reproduction. Shape of last instar nymphal Baetis was expressed as the ratio wing length/mesonotum length. It is size-dependent, a characteristic, instar-specific shape may not occur in this mayfly. Nymphal and subimaginal exuviae together represent about 14 % of last instar nymphal dry weight. Females of Baetis are about 55 % heavier than males. Unlike in Plecoptera, the size/weight (ML/AFDW) relationship differs between sexes...|$|E

30|$|The three <b>wing</b> support <b>bearings</b> at A, B, {{and along}} the line AC are {{sufficient}} to support the wing. Because the wing rotates relative to the transition span about line BC, a fourth bearing could be located along that line.

Thus, three bearings are recommended.|$|R

500|$|Leonardo first gained notoriety for {{his work}} on the Baptism of Christ, painted in {{conjunction}} with Verrocchio.

30|$|For the <b>wing</b> support <b>bearings,</b> {{vertical}} stiffness {{is desirable}} to prevent excessive deflection of the bearing {{and the corresponding}} bending of the rails. If a bearing type is selected that has different rotation capacities about different axes, the bearing should be oriented so that its largest capacity is available for rotation about the axis AC in Fig.  6, since that is the axis of applied rotation. Elastomeric bearings often provide the most economical support system and are particularly attractive when the primary axes of rotation are unclear, such as in a skewed or curved bridge. However, their vertical and rotational stiffnesses are linked, in that a high vertical stiffness requires a high shape factor, which in turn leads to a high rotational stiffness. Thus, in cases where large rotations need to be accommodated while maintaining high vertical stiffness, some other bearing type may be needed.|$|R
