500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> hours ago. One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E

"Thinking {{back to when}} we met and {{the many}} times that we spent {{together}} and whenever we were out together, {{there would be a}} caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships.... Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a bond.... Both of us needed to be adults very early, but when we were together, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> little kids having fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Entwistle {{recalled}} {{being close}} to Moon on tour: [...] "I suppose <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> of a kind"...We shared a room {{on the road and}} got up to no good." [...] Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 Los Angeles Times interview he admitted, [...] "A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches." [...] In Alabama, Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, [...] "That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management brought our suitcases down to the gig and said: 'Don't come back...'" ...|$|E

500|$|A club music {{song that}} lasts for three minutes, forty-one seconds, [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] appears as the ninth track on the album; track ten is a fifty-one second reprise called [...] "Up Out My Face (The Reprise)". Its {{instrumentation}} {{makes use of}} a [...] "thumping" [...] marching band coda, while its lyrics are about expressing [...] "anger at an incompatible lover". Brian Mansfield of USA Today highlights the lyrics [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> Lego blocks, even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again" [...] {{as one of the}} album's [...] "many funny lines". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen wrote that the singer [...] "gets in touch with her funny bone" [...] on [...] "Up Out My Face". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the references to Lego, Harvard University and Humpty Dumpty as [...] "a whole new level of lyrical ridiculousness".|$|E
500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that we would get the reputation that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> guys who could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s he {{performed}} often with George Shearing, recording six albums together for Concord Records. About this period Shearing wrote:"It {{is impossible to}} imagine a more compatible musical partner... I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances. As Mel put it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> bodies of one musical mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stenhouse, who tied a career-best Sprint Cup Series {{finish with}} a runner-up finish in a special paint scheme {{dedicated}} to the late Bryan Clauson, said afterwards that he [...] "knew {{we were going to}} have to get everything perfect, and it took me a minute to get the top going. I wanted to give up when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> [...] down, but I remembered we had Bryan Clauson’s tribute car here, and his favorite helmet, and I dug deep and the guys dug deep and made a lost of changes that made our Fastenal Ford a lot better. We really wanted to park it in Victory Lane for his whole family and all of his friends and fans for Tim, Di, Taylor and Lauren his fiancée… Just a little bit short." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{initially}} {{pleased with the}} script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach, and said to Leone, [...] "In the first film I was alone. In the second, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>two.</b> Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry". As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career and {{he was forced to}} sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor Franco Nero, who was filming Texas, Adios at the time.|$|E

During Sontag's lifetime, neither woman publicly disclosed whether the relationship was a platonic friendship or romantic. Newsweek magazine in 2006 made reference to Leibovitz's decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating, [...] "The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket. They never lived together, though they each had an apartment within view of the other's." [...] Leibovitz, when interviewed for her autobiography A Photographer's Life: 19902005, said the book told a number of stories, and [...] "with Susan, it was a love story." [...] While The New York Times in 2009 referred to Sontag as Leibovitz's [...] "companion", Leibovitz wrote in A Photographer's Life that [...] "words like 'companion' and 'partner' were not in our vocabulary. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> people who helped each other through our lives.

2500|$|Sontag {{had a close}} romantic {{relationship}} with photographer Annie Leibovitz. They met in 1989, when both had already established notability in their careers. Leibovitz has suggested that Sontag mentored her and constructively criticized her work.

Newsweek in 2006 made reference to Leibovitz's decade-plus relationship with Sontag, stating, [...] "The two first met in the late '80s, when Leibovitz photographed her for a book jacket.
