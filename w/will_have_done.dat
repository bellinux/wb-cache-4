25|$|The {{decay of}} {{a mixture of}} two or more {{materials}} which each decay exponentially, but with different half-lives, is not exponential. Mathematically, the sum of two exponential functions is not a single exponential function. A common example of such a situation is the waste of nuclear power stations, which is a mix of substances with vastly different half-lives. Consider a mixture of a rapidly decaying element A, with a half-life of 1 second, and a slowly decaying element B, with a half-life of 1 year. In a couple of minutes, almost all atoms of element A will have decayed after repeated halving of the initial number of atoms, but very few of the atoms of element B <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so as {{only a tiny fraction of}} its half-life has elapsed. Thus, the mixture taken as a whole will not decay by halves.|$|E
