40|$|Abstract. Organic {{agriculture}} {{is considered to}} be a durable system, in which the manure utilization assures a high quality of the production obtained and also of the soil’s properties. Through application of high quantities of the organic fertilizers, in dozes of 50 t/ha and 100 t/ha of manure, comparatively with variants fertilized with NPK and unfertilized variants, results showed an improvement of the soil’s properties to all cultures as fallowed: pea-beans, wheat, potato and maize. The results obtained on argic phaeozem revealed that 50 t/ha manure applied on soil lead to increased the hydro stability of the soils aggregates between 5 and 8 %, increased values of <b>wilting</b> point <b>coefficient</b> and also the pH values between 0, 5 and 1 to all cultures. A higher quantity of manure, 100 t/ha has not showed high differences compare to witness regarding the aggregate stability and led to increase of the CO values, which means a negative effect during the drought season when plant cannot take the water from showers, which will be held from soil. Regarding the organic matter content, the values were different depending on culture and their efficiency to use manure. Thus, the differences between witness and 100 t/ha manure variant were the highest, at pea (2. 12) and wheat culture (1. 76) ...|$|R
40|$|Using native {{vegetation}} {{to improve}} soil stiffness, stabilise slopes and control erosion is a rapidly evolving process. A theoretical model previously {{developed by the}} authors for the rate of tree root water uptake together with an associated numerical simulation is used to {{study the effects of}} a wide range of soil, tree, and atmospheric parameters on partially saturated ground. The influence of different parameters on the maximum initial rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. Field measurements taken from previously published literature are compared with numerical predictions for validation. The rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at <b>wilting</b> point, the <b>coefficient</b> of permeability and the distribution of root length density are studied in detail. The analysis shows that the rate of potential transpiration increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, while the potential transpiration rate has an insignificant effect on the distribution of soil suction. Root density distribution factors affect the size of the influence zone. Suction at the wilting point increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, whereas the saturation permeability decreases the maximum soil matric suction generated. The analysis confirms that the most sensitive parameters, including the coefficients of the tree root system, the transpiration rate, the permeability of the soil and its suction at the wilting point should be measured or estimated accurately for an acceptable prediction of ground conditions in the vicinity of trees...|$|R
40|$|Turgor {{regulation}} at reduced water contents {{was closely}} associated with changes in the elastic quality of the cell walls of individual needles and shoots of naturally drought-resistant seedlings of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss.) and of seedlings of intermediate resistance that had been pretreated with paclobutrazol, a stress-protecting, synthetic plant-growth regulator. Paclobutrazol-treated seedlings showed marked increases in drought resistance, and pressure-volume analysis combined with Chardakov measurements confirmed observations that water stress was ameliorated during prolonged drought. Turgor was maintained in the paclobutrazol-treated and in the naturally resistant drought-stressed seedlings despite water contents near or below the turgor-loss volumes of well-watered controls. The maintenance of turgor in these seedlings was in large part {{a function of the}} dynamic process of cell wall adjustment, as reflected by marked reductions in both the saturated and turgor-loss volumes and by large increases in the elastic coefficients of the tissues. Shear and Young's moduli, calculated from pressure-volume curves and the radii and wall thicknesses of mesophyll cells, also confirmed observed changes in the elastic qualities of the cell walls. Elastic coefficients of well-watered, paclobutrazol-treated seedlings were consistently larger than those in well-watered controls and several times larger than the values in untreated plants, which succumbed rapidly to drought. In contrast, untreated seedlings that withstood prolonged drought without <b>wilting</b> displayed elastic <b>coefficients</b> similar to those in seedlings that had been treated with paclobutrazol but that had not been exposed to drought...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of organic amendments on soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, bulk density, aggregate stability, field capacity and plant available water in a representative Chinese Mollisol. Four treatments were as follows: no fertilization (CK), application of inorganic fertilizer (NPK), combined application of inorganic fertilizer with maize straw (NPK+S) and addition of biochar with inorganic fertilizer (NPK+B). Our results showed that after three consecutive years of application, the values of soil bulk density were significantly lower in both organic amendment-treated plots than in unamended (CK and NPK) plots. Compared with NPK, NPK+B more effectively increased the contents of soil organic carbon, improved the relative proportion of soil macro-aggregates and mean weight diameter, and enhanced field capacity as well as plant available water. Organic amendments had no obvious effect on soil C/N ratio or <b>wilting</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The results of linear regression indicated that the improvement in soil water retention {{could be attributed to}} the increases in soil organic carbon and aggregate stability...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{images are}} an {{important}} source of information to identify and analyse some hazardous climatic phenomena such as the dryness and drought. These phenomena are characterized by scarce rainfall, increased evapotranspiration and high soil moisture deficit. The soil water reserve depletes to the <b>wilting</b> <b>coefficient,</b> soon followed by the pedological drought which has negative effects on vegetation and agricultural productivity. The MODIS satellite images (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) allow the monitoring of the vegetation throughout the entire vegetative period, with a frequency of 1 - 2 days and with a spatial resolution of 250 m, 500 m and 1 km away. Another useful source of information is the LANDSAT satellite images, with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Based on MODIS and Landsat satellite images, were calculated moisture monitoring index such as SIWSI (Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index). Consequently, some years with low moisture such as 2000, 2002, 2007 and 2012 could be identified. Spatially, the areas with moisture deficit varied from one year to another all over the whole analised period (2000 - 2012). The remote sensing results was corelated with Standard Precipitation Anomaly, which gives a measure of the severity of a wet or dry event...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, to {{evaluate}} the hydrological effects of Caragana korshinskii Kom., measured data were combined with model-simulated data to assess the C. korshinskii soil water content based on water balance equation. With measured and simulated canopy interception, plant transpiration and soil evaporation, soil water content was modeled with the water balance equation. The monthly variations in the modeled soil water content by measured and simulated components (canopy interception, plant transpiration, soil evaporation) were then compared with in situ measured soil water content. Our results shows that the modeled monthly water loss (canopy interception + soil evaporation + plant transpiration) by measured and simulated components ranges from 43. 78 mm to 113. 95 mm and from 47. 76 mm to 125. 63 mm, respectively, while the monthly input of water (precipitation) ranges from 27. 30 mm to 108. 30 mm. The relative error between soil water content modeled by measured and simulated components was 6. 41 %. To sum up, the net change in soil water (ΔSW) is negative in every month of the growing season. The soil moisture is approaching to <b>wilting</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{at the end of}} the growth season, and the soil moisture recovered during the following season...|$|E
40|$|Bioengineering {{including}} native vegetation is {{an ancient}} method of improving the stability of slopes. In modern railway engineering, this technique is re-captured for increasing the soil stiffness and shear strength of sub-grade beneath rail tracks. Currently this practice has become increasingly popular in Australia for stabilising railway corridors built over expansive clays and compressive soft soils. The tree roots provide three stabilising functions: (a) reinforcement of the soil, (b) dissipation of excess pore pressures and (c) establishing sufficient matric suction to increase the shear strength. The main focus {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of vegetation on soil matric suction, ground settlement and lateral movement (radial consolidation). A mathematical model for the rate of root water uptake has been developed based on the root growth rate and considering ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters. The three independent features in the root water uptake model considered in detail are soil suction, root distribution, and potential transpiration. In order to establish a rigorous analysis for estimating the actual transpiration or root water uptake, the above mentioned factors have been quantified through relevant equations to develop the proposed root water uptake model. A two dimensional finite element approach based on ABAQUS has been employed to solve the transient coupled flow and deformation equations. The proposed root water uptake model has been implemented in the coupled analysis by introducing a sink term as a subroutine in the finite element analysis. The finite element mesh can be constructed using partially/fully saturated soil elements, representing the salient aspects of unsaturated permeability and the soil water characteristic curve. The model formulation is based on the general effective stress theory of unsaturated soils. Based on this proposed model, the distribution of the matric suction profile adjacent to the tree has been numerically analysed. To validate the model, an array of field measurements conducted at Miram site in Victoria, Australia and the data have been compared with the numerical predictions. The predicted results calculated using the soil, plant, and atmospheric parameters contained in the numerical model, compared favourably with the field and the associated laboratory measurements, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed. The numerical analysis encompassing the developed root water uptake model can reasonably predict the region of maximum matric suction (away from the tree trunk axis), which has been consistent with the field measurements. Moreover, field measurements taken from the previously published literature have been compared with the numerical predictions. It is found that given the approximation of the assumed model parameters, the agreement between the predicted results and field data is still promising. The influence of different parameters on the maximum rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. In addition, the rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at <b>wilting</b> point, the <b>coefficient</b> of permeability and the distribution of root length density have been studied in detail. The findings of this study confirm that four key parameters, including permeability, wilting point suction, density and distribution of the root length, and the rate of potential transpiration should be estimated or measured accurately in order to predict the behaviour of clayey soils near tree roots. The action of a single tree on improving the soil behaviour has been compared to a vertical drain with applied suction (vacuum pressure). It is seen that root water uptake and associated matric suction is analogous to a prefabricated vertical drain with vacuum preloading, and the lateral inward displacements simulate the radial consolidation process of prefabricated vertical drains. If a pattern of trees can be grown systematically along rail corridors, this may offer a cheaper and more environmentally attractive solution to vertical drains in the long-term. The results of this study provide a valuable and a relatively accurate mean to estimate the influences of vegetation on ground. The numerical model developed herein offers practicing geotechnical engineers an effective tool for designing structures on vadose zones containing vegetation. It is desirable to consider the influence zone of tree roots and the improved soil properties in modern geotechnical designs, benefiting from native vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} and vegetation growth {{are the most}} direct and important indicators of drought events and, therefore, an understanding of vegetation and soil spectral behavior {{is critical to the}} drought estimation. Recently, Ghulam et al. [Ghulam, A., Qin, Q., Zhan, Z., 2006. Designing of the perpendicular drought index. Environmental Geology, doi: 10. 1 007 /sOO 254 - 006 - 0544 - 2 (accessed March 8, 2007). ] established the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) that is based on an extensive analysis of spatial distribution features of soil moisture in NIR-Red spectral space. In this paper, an improved drought monitoring method, the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), is developed introducing vegetation fraction, which takes into account both soil {{moisture and}} vegetation growth. To validate the drought indices proposed by this paper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images from different times registered over different eco-systems with various drought conditions are used to calculate the PDI and MPDI over ground measuring points. The PDI and MPDI are then compared to an in-situ drought index obtained from field measurements made synchronously with the satellite overpass, including the bulk soil moisture content at different soil depths, field moisture capacity, <b>wilting</b> <b>coefficient,</b> etc. It is evident from the results that the PDI and the MPDI is highly accordant with in-situ drought values with the highest correlation (R- 2 = 0. 8134) found between the MPDI and an in-situ drought index derived from 0 - 20 cm mean soil moisture. This study concludes that the PDI and the MPDI provide quite similar results for bare soil surfaces, especially {{in the early stages of}} vegetation growth. However, the MPDI demonstrates a much better performance in measuring vegetated surfaces since it takes into account both soil moisture and vegetation growth in the modeling process. The MPDI has the potential to provide a simple and real-time drought monitoring method in the remote estimation of drought phenomena.

40|$|Aims A new drought-resistance farming {{technology}} of double {{ridges and furrows}} mulched with plastic film and furrow planting (PMF) is widely applied on rain-fed agriculture {{in the middle and}} eastern part of Gansu Province, China, to increase crop yield and water use efficiency. However, its impacts on seasonal and annual soil water dynamics are not well understood. Our objectives were to (a) investigate seasonal and annual changes in soil water content, corn yield and water use efficiency of different mulching methods and (b) evaluate the ecological impact of PMF on rain-fed cropland in semi-arid areas. Methods We studied three treatments: PMF, whole field surface sand mulching and flat planting (SM) and uncovered and flat planting (CK). Using oven-drying and neutron-probe methods, we observed soil water in the 0 – 200 cm layer from 2009 to 2010. Important findings PMF could improve soil water storage in the 0 – 200 cm layer significantly before corn jointing and improve corn development in the early growth period. With corn growth, {{there was a significant difference}} in water consumption among the three treatments in the sequence PMF > SM > CK. Conversely, the sequence of change of soil water storage was CK > SM > PMF. Under the same precipitation, soil water restoration depth of PMF was deepest and CK was shallowest (in the 0 – 200 cm soil layer). The quantity and depth of soil water consumption increased with increases of corn planting years in PMF treatment, e. g., depth of water consumptiondeepened from 20 – 120 cm to 120 – 200 cm from 2009 to 2010. After two years of continuous cropping of corn, soil water content in the 40 – 120 cm layer was < 9. 0 % in all three treatments, the soil water content of PMF treatment decreased to 7. 9 % (which is close to the <b>wilting</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 7. 2 %) and corn development depended on rainfall in the growing season. This indicates that continuous corn cropping with PMF would result in a dry soil layer in semiarid areas. Water consumption, corn yield and water use efficiency were highest in PMF treatment, but lowest in CK in both years. Therefore, PMF could improve corn yield significantly, but continuous cropping may result in significant reduction of soil water storage and was disadvantageous to sustainable development capacity of cropland...|$|E
