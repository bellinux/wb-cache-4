5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin and disappointment, {{that he would}} soon be relieved of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E

However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E

It would be part of a force of 8,000 soldiers from US Army Europe to deploy. The brigade <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> over 20 major units from Europe to deploy to the Middle East in 2008; most of these units came from the 21st Theater Sustainment Command and V Corps. Throughout the Spring of 2008, the unit prepared for the deployment by conducting training exercises in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil text Kanda Puranam narrates {{about the}} birth of Shasta {{identified}} with Aiyanar. The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva's Shakti (wife and power) Parvati in a male form. The legend begins with Shiva's request and Vishnu's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form, that he assumed for the distribution of amrita. Shiva {{falls in love with}} Mohini and proposes a union with her. Mohini-Vishnu declines saying that union of two same sex women was unfruitful. Shiva informs Mohini-Vishnu that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> forms of his Shakti. Thereafter, their union resulted in {{the birth of}} a dark boy with red locks, who was named Hariharaputra. Further, he was also known as Shasta and Aiyannar.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Miller {{generally}} {{played in}} the Tests as an opening bowler alongside Lindwall and as a middle-order batsman, coming in at No. 4 or No. 5. His batting ability was such that he played as a specialist batsman {{even when he was}} unable to bowl due to injury, such as during the Second Test. Miller wanted to play purely as a batsman, feeling that the workload of bowling would hinder his run-scoring. However, Bradman was intent on going through the tour undefeated, and utilised his bowling options to the full, to maximise the Australiansâ€™ chances of winning. Lindwall and Miller were the first-choice pace duo, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest speed pairings in the history of cricket, whereas the latter <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many accomplished batsmen in the team. As a result, the Australian skipper valued Miller more as an opening bowler. He ended the Tests with 184runs at 26.28 and 13wickets at 23.15 from 138.1overs and took eight catches.|$|E

5|$|Evans' {{contributions}} to steam {{were not as}} ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he {{played a critical role}} by inventing and propagating the high-pressure steam engine in the United States. Evans' engines, particularly the Columbian, were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas, and his death during steam's infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for high-pressure engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans' dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos, would not see widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high-pressure engine that would make that dream possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic The Prodigal (1955), {{followed}} by the John Wayne adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This was a difficult time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; the public was staying home. Turner <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station {{opened on}} the SDSU campus, after {{construction}} began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability of parking around campus. The $103 million station <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the university's several construction projects {{that occurred in the}} 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project {{led to the development of}} the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space.|$|E

5|$|Sledd had not {{anticipated}} that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed {{that it would be}} selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida State College in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.|$|E
5|$|By 1904, Crawford {{dominated}} the Repton team. He scored 759 runs and his 75 wickets {{were more than}} the combined total {{of all the other}} bowlers in the team. He was particularly effective in the school's most important fixtures. The report in Wisden described him as possibly the best amateur bowler in England that year: he bowled medium-paced off spin, although he varied the speed of his delivery from slow to fast. Surrey County Cricket Club took an interest in Crawford almost immediately, calling him to a trial in 1903. Following his achievements in 1904, he was invite to play for the county. The county club {{was in the midst of}} a spell of uncertainty; several men captained the team, but only for a handful of matches each. The composition of the side continually changed, and the team performed poorly, causing unrest among supporters accustomed to success. Crawford <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many players brought in as an experiment, albeit one of the most successful. He made his first-class debut against Kent. Taking three wickets and top-scoring in Surrey's first innings with 54, Crawford did well enough to retain his place for another seven games, and was praised in the press for his performances. Against Gloucestershire, he took seven wickets for 43 runs in the second innings, and a total of ten wickets in the match. In the season as a whole he took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 16.93 to top the county's bowling averages, and scored 229 runs at an average of 16.35.|$|E
