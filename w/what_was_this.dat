During her career she had two significant refits. The work for her first overhaul was done at Halifax from 11 August to 20 December 1942 after La Malbaie had developed mechanical trouble (<b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>this?).</b> The second was done from mid-September to mid-December 1943 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia.|$|E

So that process was started before the pilot really, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is reason}} to believe that Ward's move to this farm was not {{completely}} voluntary, since, for generations back, there had been no farmers in his family. Years later, Robert Quigley King acquired another large tract of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> time raw farm land in much closer Hancock County, Ohio, near the small village of Vanlue. In 1887, he sent his other surviving son, Robert Leffler King (who also went by his middle name, [...] "Leffler"), off to develop that land and farm it. Leffler arrived at this land without buildings in the [...] "thick of winter". There is no doubt that Leffler did not want to leave the ease of the family wealth in Springfield for a hard farm life. However, family members who knew him say he could not stand up to his father. So, he went, erected a house and farm buildings and otherwise developed the farm, overcoming many obstacles. He met and married his wife, Lola Montez Askam King, in the Vanlue community and brought up his family on this farm, which he called [...] "Grassland Farm". He describes his many hardships in his farm journal, which hardships were probably very similar to the ones Ward must have experienced in turning himself into a farmer on his Maitland farm.|$|E
