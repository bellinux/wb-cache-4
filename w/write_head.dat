In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known <b>write</b> <b>head</b> materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Measurements are {{reported}} on the in-plane and the perpendicular components of the remanence a tape acquires on passing through the steady field of a recording head. The tape coatings were oriented and unoriented particles of y-Fe,O,, oriented CrO, and unoriented Co-substituted y-Fe,O,. The two <b>writing</b> <b>heads</b> used had 10 pm- and 2. 25 pm-gaps, respectively. In each case the in-plane magnetization increases at first with increasing writing current, and eventually reaches a peak that {{is less than the}} maximum in-plane remanence produced on the same sample by an electromagnet. For higher values of writing current, in-plane magnetization in the tape actually decreases. The perpendicular remanence is not large enough to explain the difference between the in-plane remanence acquired from the head and the remanence acquired in a magnet. The perpendicular component of the field from the <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> is shown to have two adverse effects on the remanence of the tape. First, it produces a perpendicular magnetization that ranges from 2 percent to 15 percent of the in-plane component. Second, it causes a reduction in the in-plane component to occur near the surface of the tape closest to the <b>writing</b> <b>head.</b> The reduction can be as large as 15 percent of the maximum in-plane remanence and will obviously have an adverse effect on recording performance, particularly at high densities...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, {{along with}} the IBM PC/AT, the high density disk appeared, which used 96 tracks per inch {{combined}} with a higher density magnetic media to provide 1,200 KB of storage (formally referred to as 1.2 megabytes). Since the usual (very expensive) hard disk held 10 - 20 megabytes at the time, this was considered quite spacious. High-density drives could also read and write to double-density disks, allowing an upgrade path. However, there were compatibility problems, in particular with non-HD drives failing to read 360 KB disks written by 1200 KB drives due to their narrower track <b>write</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The popular {{explanation}} for the advantage of perpendicular recording is that it achieves higher storage densities by aligning the poles of the magnetic elements, which represent bits, perpendicularly {{to the surface of}} the disk platter, as shown in the illustration. In this not-quite-accurate explanation, aligning the bits in this manner takes less platter than what would have been required had they been placed longitudinally. This means cells can be placed closer together on the platter, thus increasing the number of magnetic elements that can be stored in a given area. The true picture is a bit more complex, having to do with the use of a magnetically [...] "stronger" [...] (higher coercivity) material as the storage medium. This is possible because in a perpendicular arrangement the magnetic flux is guided through a magnetically soft (and relatively thick) underlayer underneath the hard magnetic media films (considerably complicating and thickening the total disk structure). This magnetically soft underlayer can be effectively considered a part of the <b>write</b> <b>head,</b> making the <b>write</b> <b>head</b> more efficient, thus making it possible to produce a stronger write field gradient with essentially the same head materials as for longitudinal heads, and therefore allowing for the use of the higher coercivity magnetic storage medium. A higher coercivity medium is inherently thermally more stable, as stability is proportional to the product of bit (or magnetic grain) volume times the uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku, which in turn is higher for a material with a higher magnetic coercivity.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>write</b> <b>head</b> magnetises {{a region}} by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise {{the region and}} to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [...] "giant" [...] magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically magneto-resistive while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.|$|E

5000|$|The G-15 was {{inspired}} by the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). It is a [...] serial-architecture machine, in which the main memory is a magnetic drum. It uses the drum as a recirculating delay line memory, in contrast to the analog delay line implementation in other serial designs. Each track has a set of read and write heads; as soon as a bit was read off a track, it is re-written on the same track a certain distance away. The length of delay, and thus the number of words on a track, is determined by the spacing of the read and write heads, the delay corresponding to the time required for a section of the drum to travel from the <b>write</b> <b>head</b> to the corresponding read head. Under normal operation, data are written back without change, but this data flow can be intercepted at any time, allowing the machine to update sections of a track as needed.|$|E
50|$|The tape drives use {{a strong}} error {{correction}} algorithm that makes data recovery possible when lost data is within one track. Also, when data is {{written to the}} tape it is verified by reading it back using the read heads that are positioned just 'behind' the <b>write</b> <b>heads.</b> This allows the drive to write a second copy of any data that fails the verify {{without the help of}} the host system.|$|R
