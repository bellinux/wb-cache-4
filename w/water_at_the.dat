5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent.

Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of {{the column}} cools off, {{but because of the}} narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of heavy water. Cominco {{had been involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from Hugh Taylor, a British-born scientist working at Princeton University, on behalf of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy <b>water.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.|$|E

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they take in <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom and eject {{it from the}} osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does {{some of the work}} for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|The gorge widens {{where the}} highway passes by Castle Valley and Professor Valley, {{which have been}} the {{shooting}} locations for many western films (including Wagon Master and Rio Grande) and television commercials.

After leaving the valley, the road winds farther up the river gorge until arriving at the Dewey Bridge, named for Dewey, a nearby ghost town.|$|E

5|$|Work on Kingswear {{began in}} 1491, with the {{intention}} of providing protection to {{the east side of the}} estuary, and by the time it was completed in 1502 it formed one of the first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. It took the form of a three-storeyed, square tower built of slate rubble with red sandstone detailing. Its large, rectangular gun-ports with wooden shutters on the ground level matched those at Dartmouth Castle, and looked out close to the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the harbour, covering both the sea and the anchorage itself. The first floor would have also held guns and provided accommodation for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect <b>water.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E

50|$|Temperature is an {{important}} abiotic factor in lentic ecosystems {{because most of the}} biota are poikilothermic, where internal body temperatures are defined by the surrounding system. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate. Shallow ponds often have a continuous temperature gradient from warmer <b>waters</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface to cooler <b>waters</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom. In addition, temperature fluctuations can be very great in these systems, both diurnally and seasonally.|$|R

5|$|He {{remained}} on the frontline until December 1915, when the area was evacuated due to the heavy fighting. Due to the extreme cold, Beadles was suffering from frostbite and was found floating unconscious in the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the evacuation and was subsequently sent to a military hospital in Malta. After recovering {{he was sent to}} re-join his regiment, who were now stationed in Palestine. He took part in all three attempts to capture Gaza and the eventual push to take Jerusalem under the command of Edmund Allenby. During the second battle of Gaza, Beadles witnessed the death of his uncle Richard Pearce who {{was shot in the head}} while standing next to him. Beadles' brother Ewart was awarded the Military Medal and promoted to the rank of Sergeant for his actions during the battle.|$|E
5|$|In season three, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is {{diagnosed}} with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side. Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season eight. A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant Jane Doe victim, suffering from amnesia. Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she {{is diagnosed}} with a personality disorder in season four, and makes her final departure. Amidst {{the crisis of the}} ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> disaster site. Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking up in what appears to be limbo. Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season, until eventually being resuscitated. Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan), who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting <b>water</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the processing. Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules. At that point, urine usually has about the same potassium concentration as plasma. At the end of the processing, potassium is secreted one more time if the serum levels are too high.|$|E
