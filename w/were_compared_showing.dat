The analysis of metal sites at the atomic level of detail provided by protein structures can thus be of benefit in functional and evolutionary studies of proteins. In this work, we propose a structural bioinformatics approach {{to the study of}} metalloproteins based on structural templates of metal sites that include the PDB coordinates of protein residues forming the first and the second coordination sphere of the metal. We have applied this approach to non-heme iron sites, which have been analyzed at various levels.

Furthermore, template comparisons have been used to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins, showing that similarity searches focused on metal sites can be advantageously combined with typical whole-domain comparisons.
