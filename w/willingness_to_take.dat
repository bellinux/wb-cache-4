5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> great {{personal}} risks. When fire {{was detected by}} a lookout, smoke jumpers were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Detroit and Hull's army wounded American morale, and {{eliminated}} the main American {{force in the}} area as a threat, {{while at the same}} time boosting morale among his own forces. Brock took the American supplies at Detroit and used them for his own forces, particularly the ill-equipped militia. Under prize regulations, a substantial part of the value of the captured military stores would accrue to him. (If he had lived longer, he could have settled his debts.) Brock valued the captured ordnance supplies at £30,000. Finally, the victory secured the support of Tecumseh and the other chiefs in his confederation, who took Brock's actions as both a sign of competence and a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action.|$|E
5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E

40|$|Universities use {{technology}} transfer to disseminate groundbreaking knowledge to biotechnology firms. Each transfer mode—licensing, sponsored contract research, and consulting arrangements —offers biotechnology firms {{an opportunity to}} acquire a unique bundle of knowledge and resources. This study proposes that an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) may influence a firm’s selection of a specific technology transfer mode. An EO reflects a firm’s <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> innovate, <b>take</b> risks, and become a first mover. This strategic orientation may guide managers to select a transfer mode that not only fits a firm’s needs but also enables it to gain an advantage.

40|$|Our {{results show}} that high-income {{families}} place significantly higher value on academic achievement than low-income families. High-income families {{are also more likely}} to penalize house price for non-desirable non-academic school quality. This paper uses quantile regression to examine the distribution of demand for school quality. For academic achievement, the average effects as estimated by OLS are biased toward zero due to “aggregation” of families’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay. We <b>take</b> advantage of a court-ordered redistricting as a quasi-random assignment of school quality.

40|$|Increasing the {{competence}} level in teaching services {{has to be}} based on a thorough knowledge of both customer needs and the way they are willing to receive the information contents. Applying rigorous scientific marketing principles to the organization and operation of education services offers the fundaments of such a development. The present article outlines the results of a qualitative research – focus group – conducted on a sample of Spiru Haret University students, which had as a main goal identifying the most effective ways of communication in the student-professor relationship in order to design creative teaching materials, perfectly adapted to present educational needs. The conclusions of the research emphasized both the perception of the students regarding the definition of their own position during the education process, and the <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> actively <b>take</b> part in developing the informational support suitable for educational services.

30|$|Early {{research}} {{has examined the}} important role of innovation within entrepreneurship (Schumpeter 1947). Therefore, in order to measure innovation, several dimensions were included in a 12 -item, seven-point Likert scale. First, new product development is an area that demonstrates where companies have exhibited innovative capability, and we have developed four items that include (1) the number of new products developed and (2) the emphasis of product development and innovation within the firm. In addition, existing unique products/services in the company's portfolio are investigated. In order for innovation to occur, entrepreneurs should be forward thinking and exhibit opportunity recognition and exploitation skills, three items that measured the <b>willingness</b> of firms <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on new opportunities and also their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> adjust their business as necessary in order to exploit them. The proactive nature of firms to utilize opportunities was measured by action and decision-making shown in uncertain situations.|$|R
30|$|While imparting {{skills is}} {{embedded}} in the work of Filipino workers, a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> share or <b>take</b> on a mentoring role is a condition for the relationship <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place (Dougherty et al. 2007 : 146). Local participants told me that Filipino workers tended to share ideas compared to fellow local colleagues who tended to keep knowledge to themselves. For example, Arjun, 30, a designer, pointed out the qualities of his mentor, Rolando, 50, a Filipino designer who was sent by the Philippine government to India as consultant for an Indian government agency. “He is a very nice person. And if you ask me, he has been more than a mentor to me. Whatever he knows, he doesn’t hesitate to share it with you. And that’s the biggest trait that all designers don’t have. Because it is a trade secret”.|$|R
25|$|Bradlaugh's {{political}} prospects {{were not}} {{damaged by the}} Knowlton scandal and {{he was elected to}} Parliament in 1881. Because of his atheism, he asked to be allowed to affirm rather than swear the oath of loyalty. When the possibility of affirmation was refused, Bradlaugh stated his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the oath. But this option was also challenged. Although many Christians were shocked by Bradlaugh, others (like the Liberal leader Gladstone) spoke up for freedom of belief. It took more than six years before the matter was completely resolved (in Bradlaugh's favour) after a series of by-elections and court appearances.|$|E

He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Third Regiment defected, he ordered any captured defectors to be publicly shot. In September he was returned to the Southern Front. During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on responsibility in conflict situations. At the same time, he disregarded orders and when affronted he repeatedly threatened to resign, forcing Lenin to convince him to reconsider.

He has a very strained relationship with Sirius, who owns Grimmauld Place and must remain there in hiding. The two trade frequent snide remarks and at one point almost begin a duel. Snape taunts Sirius about the latter's not being able to take an active role in the Order's missions because of his fugitive status. Harry feels later that this taunting contributed to Sirius' <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> unsafe risks. Back at school, Snape's allegiance to the Order has no effect on his dislike for Harry.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{internal}} influences is {{the amount}} of available finance. A number of operational decisions would involve considerable investment. Another internal influence can be the type and size of an organisation. For example, if a business changes its legal structure, its aim might be changed and its operational objectives should be revised as well. In addition, key stakeholders such as managers, owners, and customers can influence the objectives. For example, if they have a high <b>willingness</b> and ability <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a risk, then more ambitious objectives might be set.|$|R

Consequently, improvisational techniques provide valuable insight for teams prototyping with new media and are particularly applicable to innovation in the field of entertainment. We consider this paper a prelude to further discussion about improvisation and the ways {{it can be used to}} explore a variety of educational and entertainment applications from a musical and theatrical perspective...|$|R
25|$|American Jews in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries {{played a}} major role in {{developing}} America's financial services industry, both at investment banks and investment funds. German Jewish bankers began to assume a major role in American finance in the 1830s when government and private borrowing to pay for canals, railroads and other internal improvements increased rapidly and significantly. Men such as August Belmont (Rothschild's agent in New York and a leading Democrat), Philip Speyer, Jacob Schiff (at Kuhn, Loeb & Company), Joseph Seligman, Philip Lehman (of Lehman Brothers), Jules Bache, and Marcus Goldman (of Goldman Sachs) illustrate this financial elite. As was true of their non-Jewish counterparts, family, personal, and business connections, a reputation for honesty and integrity, ability, and a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> calculated risks were essential to recruit capital from widely scattered sources. The families and the firms which they controlled were bound together by religious and social factors, and by the prevalence of intermarriage. These personal ties fulfilled real business functions before the advent of institutional organization in the 20th century. Antisemitic elements often falsely targeted them as key players in a supposed Jewish cabal conspiring to dominate the world.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{negotiation}} process starts, {{people in a}} positive mood have more confidence, and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. During the negotiation, negotiators {{who are in a}} positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and more cooperative strategies. This in turn increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem solving, respect for others' perspectives, <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> risks and higher confidence. Post-negotiation positive affect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with achieved outcome and influences one's desire for future interactions. The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings commitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions. PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts perception of self performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it actually is. Thus, studies involving self reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{incomplete}} contracts, {{efficiency of}} an organization depends on <b>willingness</b> of individuals <b>to</b> <b>take</b> non-selfish actions, e. g., cooperate {{when there is no}} incentive to do so, or punish inefficient actions by others. Organizations also constitute a social boundary, or group. We investigate whether this social aspect of organizations has an important benefit, fostering unselfish cooperation and norm enforcement within the group, but whether there is also a dark side, in the form of hostility between groups. Our experiment provides the first evidence without the confounding effect of self-selection into groups. Individuals are randomly assigned to different platoons during a four-week portion of officer training in the Swiss Army. We conduct choice experiments - simultaneous prisoner's dilemma games, with and without third-party punishment - in week three. Random assignment significantly increases <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with fellow platoon members. Assignment does not lead to hostility, in the sense of vindictive punishment of outsiders, but does affect norm enforcement, enhancing <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> enforce a norm of cooperation towards fellow platoon members. This suggests that the social aspect of organizations motivates efficient behavior even when ordinary incentives fail, and helps explain practices designed to foster social ties or group identification within an organization...|$|R

These constraints might include restrictions on immigration, limits on free speech and association and laws regulating moral behaviour. It is the <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> support or <b>take</b> action that leads to increased social uniformity that makes right-wing authoritarianism more than just a personal distaste for difference. Right-wing authoritarianism is characterized by obedience to authority, moral absolutism, racial and ethnic prejudice, and intolerance and punitiveness towards dissidents and deviants. In parenting, right-wing authoritarians value children's obedience, neatness, and good manners.|$|R
