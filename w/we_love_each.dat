So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{marks the}} end of Ugly Betty. ABC {{announced}} in January 2010 that the series' fourth season was to be the last, following falling ratings. In a joint statement Silvio Horta and ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson said [...] "We've mutually come to the difficult decision to make this Ugly Bettys final season." [...] The network cut the episode order from 22 to 20, but gave the writers enough time to create a satisfying conclusion that was to air on April 14. On what he was set out to accomplish with the series finale, Horta said [...] "Primarily, I wanted it to be about Betty's journey, about Betty making it in her professional life, first and foremost, overcoming the obstacles in her past and really succeeding". Vanessa Williams said the cancellation of Ugly Betty was [...] "devastating" [...] for the cast. She said [...] "Our cast was one of those rare opportunities where <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> other. It was a real shocker, and really devastating when it all ended".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Stephen Holden from The New York Times, Madonna explained {{the significance of the}} performance: [...] "Finally, right when you think I'll end [...] on a happy note, I come out with my family to do a Bob Fosse-meets-'Clockwork Orange' rendition of 'Keep It Together'. It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also no mistaking that <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna is in control, but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance." [...] Two different performances were recorded and released on video: the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, filmed in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, filmed in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. It was also shown on the HBO special titled Madonna Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour, and was added in her 1991 documentary, [...]|$|E
2500|$|According to Tennov, {{there are}} at least two types of love: limerence, which she {{describes}} as, among other things, [...] "loving attachment", and [...] "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and his or her parents and children. She notes that one form may evolve into the other: [...] "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> other very much'". The distinction is comparable to that drawn by ethologists [...] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity", just as [...] "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".|$|E
2500|$|In New Testament theology, in {{addition}} to [...] "life" [...] (zoe, i.e. ζωὴ in Greek), {{there is also a}} promised spiritual life sometimes described by the adjective eternal (aionios i.e. αἰώνιος in Greek) but other times simply referred to as [...] "life". In both John and Paul the possibility of attaining eternal life and avoiding the wrath of God is dependent on believing in Jesus, the Son of God. For John abiding in Christ involves love for one another, as in , and [...] The existence of divine love in believers, then facilitates the influence of the gospel on the world, and lead to widespread salvation. [...] then manifests [...] "the already but not yet" [...] acquisition of eternal life by referring to the acquisition of eternal life as a once for all (ephapax) event, and the role of love in attaining it: [...] "We know that we have passed from death to life, because <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>each</b> other.
