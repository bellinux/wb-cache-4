5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E
5|$|Late on January 1, 2009, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{reported}} that {{an area of}} deep atmospheric convection had persisted for the last 48hours about 730km (455mi), to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. Deep convection was developing over the northern quadrant of a weak low level circulation center. A subtropical ridge of pressure was helping to guide the disturbance and was providing good outflow as well as low to moderate vertical wind shear. However, as the disturbance was moving into {{a higher level of}} vertical wind shear the depression was not expected to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 48 hours. During the next 48 hours the disturbance gradually developed, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reporting early on January 3 that it had become the first tropical depression of the season, with the name Auring being assigned to the depression by PAGASA whilst it was located about 140km (85mi) east of Surigao City on the Philippine island of Mindanao. This came after the low level circulation center had started to consolidate as deep convection was being fueled by a poleward diffluence despite being in an area of strong vertical wind shear. Over {{the next couple of days}} as Auring moved towards the east, dry air started to <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> to its low level circulation center which started to weaken the depression after it had peaked with winds of 45km/h, (30mph) 10-min sustained and a peak pressure of 1006 hPa/Mbar. As the baroclinic zone approached the depression late on January 5, PAGASA downgraded the depression to an area of low pressure as the baroclinic zone was approaching the depression, as vertical wind shear had increased and outflow became hindered. However the JMA continued to issue warnings on the depression until early the next morning when the depression was declared dissipated by the JTWC and the JMA.|$|E

25|$|LDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.910–0.940nbsp&g/cm3. LDPE has {{a high degree of}} short- and {{long-chain}} branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the crystal structure as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction is less. This results in a lower tensile strength and increased ductility. LDPE is created by free-radical polymerization. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable flow properties. LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film <b>wrap.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, the global LDPE market had a volume of almost US$33 billion.|$|E

In September 2002, KFC sales were down 10 percent against the previous year.

2500|$|The sari {{evolved from}} a three-piece {{ensemble}} comprising the Antriya, the lower garment; the Uttariya; a veil worn over the shoulder or the head; and the Stanapatta, a chestband. This ensemble is mentioned in Sanskrit literature and Buddhist Pali literature during the 6th century B.C. This complete three-piece dress was known as Poshak, generic term for costume. Ancient Antriya closely resembled dothi <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "fishtail" [...] version which was passed through legs, covered the legs loosely and then flowed into a long, decorative pleats at front of the legs. It further evolved into Bhairnivasani skirt, today known as ghagri and lehenga. Uttariya was a shawl-like veil worn over the shoulder or head, it evolved into what is known today known as dupatta and ghoongat. Likewise, Stanapatta evolved into choli by 1st century A.D. Between 2nd century B.C to 1st century A.D, Antariya and Uttariya was merged to form a single garment known as sari mentioned in Pali literature, which served the purpose of two garments in one-piece.|$|E

6000|$|... "Those same Crusades are now {{pleasant}} {{matter for}} me. You remember, {{or perhaps you}} do not, a thing I once sent you about Coeur-de-Lion. Long since, I settled to make the Cantos you saw {{part of a larger}} Book; and worked at it, last autumn and winter, till I had a bad illness. I am now at work on it again; and go full sail, like my hero. There are six Cantos done, roughly, besides what you saw. I have struck out most of the absurdest couplets, and given the whole a higher though still sportive tone. It is becoming a kind of Odyssey, with a laughing and Christian Achilles for hero. One may manage to <b>wrap,</b> <b>in</b> that chivalrous brocade, many things belonging to our Time, and capable of interesting it. The thing is not bad; but will require great labor. Only it is labor that I thoroughly like; and which keeps the maggots out of one's brain, until their time.|$|E
6000|$|Neither at Penang, Singapur, nor {{this place}} have I seen a single Chinaman asleep while {{daylight}} lasted. Nor have I seen twenty {{men who were}} obviously loafing. All were going to some definite end--if it were only like the coolie on the wharf, to steal wood from the scaffolding of a half-built house. In his own land, I believe, the Chinaman is treated {{with a certain amount}} of carelessness, not to say ferocity. Where he hides his love of art, the Heaven that made him out of the yellow earth that holds so much iron only knows. His love is for little things, or else why should he get quaint pendants for his pipe, and at the backmost back of his shop build up for himself a bowerbird's collection of odds and ends, every one of which has beauty if you hold it sufficiently close to the eye. It grieves me that I cannot account for the ideas of a few hundred million men in a few hours. This much, however, seems certain. If we had control over as many Chinamen as we have natives of India, and had given them one tithe of the cossetting, the painful pushing forward, and studious, even nervous, regard of their interests and aspirations that we have given to India, we should long ago have been expelled from, or have reaped the reward of, the richest land on the face of the earth. A pair of my shoes have been, oddly enough, wrapped in a newspaper which carries for its motto the words, [...] "There is no Indian nation, though there exists the germs of an Indian nationality," [...] or something very like that. This thing has been moving me to unholy laughter. The great big lazy land that we nurse and <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> cotton-wool, and ask every morning whether it is strong enough to get out of bed, seems like a heavy soft cloud on the far-away horizon; and the babble that we were wont to raise about its precious future and its possibilities, no more than the talk of children in the streets who have made a horse out of a pea-pod and match-sticks, and wonder if it will ever walk. I am sadly out of conceit of mine own other--not mother--country now that I have had my boots blacked at once every time I happened to take them off. The blacker did not do it for the sake of a gratuity, but because it was his work. Like the beaver of old, he had to climb that tree; the dogs were after him. There was competition.|$|E

And when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I wake I try to hypnotize her, but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid! I am afraid of all things, even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.|$|E
