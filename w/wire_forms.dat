40|$|Abstract. For known {{well the}} {{contributions}} of both tension-compression-ratio of material and intermediate principal shear stress to <b>wire</b> <b>forming,</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> problem is developed based on unified strength theory. By denoting a notation of D, the unified stresses solution for <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> is gained, which is suitable to both wire drawing and extrusion. In addition, when material has identical strength in tension and compression, the stresses solution based on unified strength theory become that based on unified yield criterion. Notably, it is proved that the stresses of <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> are independent of the intermediate principal shear stress. Whether any yield criterion (e. g., Mises, Tresca or unified yield criterion) is adopted, for {{it is assumed that}} the tensile and compressive strength is equal to one another, the stresses solution is as same as that based on unified yield criterion, and is merely a special case of the unified stresses solution developed by this paper...|$|R

5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the <b>wire</b> <b>forms</b> into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the leadframe). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the wedge bond, tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|E

The stimuli in previously reported studies were <b>wire</b> <b>forms,</b> which con represented only in terms of contour.

40|$|In recent years, {{a demand}} for compact, lightweight, {{solid-state}} actuation systems has emerged, driven {{in part by the}} needs of the aeronautics industry. However, most actuation systems used in turbomachinery require not only elevated temperature but high-force capability. As a result, shape memory alloy (SMA) based systems have worked their way to the forefront of a short list of viable options to meet such a technological challenge. Most of the effort centered on shape memory systems to date has involved binary NiTi alloys but the working temperatures required in many aeronautics applications dictate significantly higher transformation temperatures than the binary systems can provide. Hence, a high temperature shape memory alloy (HTSMA) based on NiTiPdPt, having a transformation temperature near 300 C, was developed. Various thermo-mechanical processing schemes were utilized to further improve the dimensional stability of the alloy and it was later extruded/drawn into <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> to be more compatible with envisioned applications. Mechanical testing on the finished <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> showed reasonable work output capability with excellent dimensional stability. Subsequently, the <b>wire</b> <b>form</b> of the alloy was incorporated into a benchtop system, which was shown to provide the necessary stroke requirements of approx. 0. 125 inches for the targeted surge-control application. Cycle times for the actuator were limited to ~ 4 seconds due to control and cooling constraints but this cycle time was determined to be adequate for the surge control application targeted as the primary requirement was initial actuation of a surge control rod, which could be completed in approximately one second...|$|R
