5|$|Director Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), though {{adapted from}} a very self-reflexive novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, plays noir {{comparatively}} straight, to devastating effect. Screenwriter David Ayer updated the classic noir bad-cop tale, typified by Shield for Murder (1954) and Rogue Cop (1954), with his scripts for Training Day (2001) and, adapting a story by James Ellroy, Dark Blue (2002); he later <b>wrote</b> <b>and</b> <b>directed</b> the even darker Harsh Times (2006). Michael Mann's Collateral (2004) features a performance by Tom Cruise as an assassin in the lineage of Le Samouraï. The torments of The Machinist (2004), directed by Brad Anderson, evoke both Fight Club and Memento. In 2005, Shane Black directed Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, basing his screenplay in part on a crime novel by Brett Halliday, who published his first stories back in the 1920s. The film plays with an awareness not only of classic noir but also of neo-noir reflexivity itself.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Farrands <b>wrote</b> <b>and</b> <b>directed</b> {{a second}} {{documentary}} {{film on the}} Friday franchise, this time directly inspired by Bracke's book. Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th discusses each of the twelve films, from the original to the 2009 remake, {{as well as the}} television series. It is narrated by Corey Feldman, and also features interviews with key individuals in the franchise's history. Farrands has suggested that his work on the well-received 2010 film, , which documented the making of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, demonstrated the possibility for a documentary film that was more in depth and more comprehensive than his previous effort, His Name Was Jason. In making such a film, Farrands turned to Bracke's book, which he had also worked on, and drew from its structure and content. Curious Goods: Behind the Scenes of Friday the 13th: The Series by Alyse Wax, a retrospective focusing on the 1987 television series, was released in October 2015 by BearManor Media.|$|E
