500|$|Is it {{reasonable}} for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while {{the producer of}} poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> world that high-efficiency producing countries {{are the ones that}} deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [...] do not support all producers.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, US-based writer Xi Nuo (...) {{released}} his book Xi Jinping and His Lovers that {{was turned down}} by Gui Minhai the previous year after he had received a visit from a Chinese government agent. Xi Nuo says his decision to publish the book was to challenge the Chinese authorities. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Chinese authorities and Xi Jinping, the president of China, that you are wrong. Completely wrong. You better release the five guys. Let them go back home". American and European associations of publishers and booksellers – including PEN American Center, the Authors Guild and the Federation of European Publishers – jointly wrote to CY Leung, urging him to take action on the missing Causeway Bay booksellers and [...] "request a formal assurance from Beijing that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration".|$|E
500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, [...] "Sony went in a new direction." ...|$|E

500|$|Hedren gave Spoto {{an account}} of the {{director}} as a sexual predator for his 1983 book, The Dark Side of a Genius (1983). Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made [...] "an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually." [...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> story. I didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years later that I told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E
500|$|Zak Penn, {{who wrote}} {{a draft of the}} first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but {{stressed}} it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which was a very different film from Alien, but still in the same continuity. He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty. After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand. Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography. In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set. Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America, and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story. There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand. Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film. Feige commented, [...] "we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [...] canon." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the {{six months}} {{following}} Kennedy's assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked, orally and in writing, {{to speak to the}} members of the Warren Commission. The commission initially showed no interest. Only after Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission (and her letters became public) did the Warren Commission agree to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, then-Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby. Ruby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying [...] "my life is in danger here" [...] and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. He added: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth, and I can't tell it here." [...] Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply, because many legal barriers would need to be broken and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him, since it had no police powers. Ruby said he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.|$|E
2500|$|The Reform Party {{was founded}} as a Western-based {{political}} {{party in a}} convention in October 1987 in Winnipeg, Manitoba led by three principal organizers including Preston Manning, former Liberal Party member Stan Roberts, and Robert Muir. On November 1, 1987, at the convention, Manning was unanimously named leader after Roberts left the convention in protest over the new party's finances. The party's delegates discussed {{a variety of topics}} to formulate policies such as calling for the party to endorse a Triple-E Senate amendment to added to the Meech Lake Accord, advocating the addition of property rights into the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and other issues such as [...] "provincial resource rights, deficit reduction, free trade, economic diversification, welfare reform, and regional fairness in federal procurements." [...] The convention briefly discussed the contentious topic of western separation, which was not a serious concern as most of the delegates rejected the idea and Manning stated that he would refuse to lead a western separatist party and went on to say [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> rest of the country not that the West is leaving, but that the West is arriving." ...|$|E
