500|$|Cast {{members were}} more {{critical}} of Eve's later appearances on the show. Ross reacted negatively to Eve's involvement in Vincent's storylines. She said that Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the birth scenes after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore. Westmore cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "This has got to be the worst storyline ever done, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> doing?".|$|E

500|$|As a {{final step}} before the planned {{invasion}} of the Japanese home islands, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April 1945. In March, in briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the Japanese Imperial Army was planning extensive air attacks, {{including the use of}} kamikaze. The emperor then reportedly asked, [...] "But what about the Navy? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?" [...] Now feeling pressured by the emperor to also mount some kind of attack, Japan's Navy commanders conceived a kamikaze-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship Yamato.|$|E
500|$|A deleted {{scene from}} early on within the episode, in which Scully {{questions}} her doctor about her ultrasound scans, {{was cut from}} the final broadcast as writer Frank Spotnitz felt it was too [...] "confusing" [...] for the viewers to place doubt on {{the actions of the}} doctor so early. Fellow series writer John Shiban said that the scene was not [...] "subtle" [...] enough to convey the right level of suspicion. Spotnitz has described [...] "Per Manum" [...] as being [...] "a real paranoia episode", concerning [...] "the way you perceive connections between people, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> saying, and is it suspicious or not".|$|E
500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> {{going to do with}} all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony.

5000|$|The vocals on {{the song}} consist {{almost entirely of}} the repeating verse, [...] "They know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>what,</b> but <b>they</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>what,</b> <b>they</b> just strut.

500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross said she felt [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This {{has got to be}} the worst storyline ever done, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> doing?"), who cited it as a reason for the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 1951, Zhou {{called a}} conference in Shenyang to discuss {{improvements}} to China's logistical network, but these did little to directly resolve China's supply problems. Peng visited Beijing several times {{over the next several}} months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951–52, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: [...] "You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?" [...] The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA's hardship.|$|E
