25|$|The diets of the {{starlings}} {{are usually}} dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example <b>white</b> <b>sandalwood,</b> Indian Banyan. In addition to trees {{they are also}} important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, {{which led to the}} speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol. Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.|$|E

50|$|Part of the {{conflict}} was rivalry over the <b>white</b> <b>sandalwood</b> (santalum album), a precious item that grew in certain quantities on Timor. After a series of defeats {{at the hands of}} the Portuguese in 1657-1658, a part of the Sonbai congregation migrated to the Dutch stronghold in Kupang together with another VOC-allied group, Amabi. Another part remained in the inland under Portuguese surveillance, and became the Sonbai Besar princedom. The Kupang area was inhabited by the Helong people, but the newcomers were settled close to the Dutch fort without serious conflict with the original inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Robert Brown, named in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae (1810) as Fusanus acuminatus, {{based on his}} type collection made at Fowlers Bay, South Australia, in 1802. Brown gave the Latin epithet acuminatus to denote the leaves - sharpened or pointed. The botanist Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle gave the current name in 1857, placing it in the genus Santalum; the genus containing Australian Sandalwood, Santalum spicatum, and <b>White</b> <b>Sandalwood,</b> Santalum album. Several botanical names have been deemed to be synonymous with Santalum acuminatum, as described in Flora of Australia (1984) and the Australian Plant Census (2006), these include: Santalum preissii F.Muell. in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae (1861); Santalum cognatum and Santalum preissianum of Miquel (1845); and Santalum densiflorum Gand. (1919).|$|E

She also tells him that the lagoon is indeed thick with pearl oysters. Sru tells her Captain Peterson would never have harmed Dick or the people, but that he must not be told about the pearls, because he {{is something of a}} profiteer and might take everything for himself. He spends the next few weeks teaching her how to steer the ship. With first mate Rantan and a beachcomber named Carlin who is hitching a ride on the ship to go to the northern islands, Sru plans and carries out a mutiny, killing both Peterson and a <b>white</b> <b>sandalwood</b> trader—and framing the natives of the island where the sandalwood trader lived for the murder.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{somewhat}} extensive review, mainly of historical nature, focusing on the period that Malacca was under Portuguese suzerainty (1511 - 1641), concerning the subject of sandalwood routes from Timor, making warehouse in the archipelago of Solor. In the sixteenth century and seventeenth-century Lusitanian writings, there are no doubts about the indexical equivalence between Timor island and <b>white</b> <b>sandalwood</b> (Santalum album L.), then notable for its abundance and quality, thus inducing an attractor. The polarity of Malacca is the tensor from which radiate the routes of the spice trade in multiple directions, for it was a privileged place of trade, combined with the monsoon regime.

40|$|Contact Dermatitis (CD) is a {{skin disease}} {{which can make}} humans fearful of wearing certain fabrications. Formaldehyde and its {{compounds}} are the main causative agents and Nickel and Chromium also work as allergens for CD. Chemicals used in finishing processes are also identified as causative agents and Fiber types can {{have an effect on}} the disease. Symptoms of the disease were reviewed using books and previous researches in this study. Reddish blisters, itching and reddish skin are common symptoms of CD. As there is no evidence about CD in Ayurveda, Western medicine and Ayurweda were linked by matching symptoms to find the connectivity of the skin diseases. Ayurweda described about “Kshudra Kushta” which has similar symptoms to those of CD. Herbs such aswild snakegourd, <b>white</b> <b>sandalwood,</b> red sandal wood and Heart leaved Moonseed are used in Ayurveda to cure “Kshudra kushta”. Mixtures of herbs with fixing agents were applied to cotton and polyester fabrications through a natural dyeing method to find a fabric finishing method for CD. Two types of fixing agents; Copper Sulphate and Aluminum Sulphate were applied separately with different amounts to identify best recipe. The herbal mixture has a reddish colour. The mixture was tested with colour fastness to wash test ISO – 165 -CO 1 : 1987 and pH value of the olutions was also checked to study the feasibility. Cotton fabrications showed acceptable durability up to three (3) washes and polyester had poor durability. Wash durability is also dependent on the amount of fixing agents. There were slight colour changes after Copper sulphate treatment; Aluminum sulphate did not showed any colour change. It has neutral pH range. Fourteen (14) different garments which cause symptoms of CD were treated with the herbal mixture and wear trials were carried out. All garments showed positive results up to 3 domestic washes...|$|E
