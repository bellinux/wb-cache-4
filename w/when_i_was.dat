5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over there was soldiers—young kids {{for the most}} part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
