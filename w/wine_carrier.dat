25|$|At {{the end of}} the First World War {{traffic was}} {{completely}} disorganized. In 1920 freight traffic recovers rapidly with the arrival of motorised barges. The HPLM company (Le Havre-Paris-Lyon-Marseille) operated 30 boats on the Canal du Midi. The Second World War saw a slowdown in traffic due to the shortage of oil but recovery was rapid after the conflict and the traffic reached 110 million tkm. However, the canal suffered from a size too small for later barges with high tonnage. Rail became more and more competitive and road transport also became a second competitor. The Canal du Midi became the third means of transport. Freight traffic ceased in the 1970s. In 1980 there were only two barges (the Bacchus, a <b>wine</b> <b>carrier</b> and the Espérance, a grain carrier) carrying regular traffic between Toulouse and Sète: they definitively ceased their activities in 1989 following the cessation of navigation pronounced by the Prefect of the Region due to drought. In 1991 operation of the canal was assigned to the administration of Voies navigables de France who remain managers today.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious {{quantities}} of anthropogenic 129 I {{have been released}} out worldwide in the last decades, principally by nuclear reprocessing plants in England and France. This work was a preliminary attempt to exploit the spatial and temporal variability of these emissions to investigate the possibility of tracing the provenance and age of <b>wines</b> worldwide. Using <b>carrier</b> free iodine extraction followed by measurements by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Tandetron of Gif-sur-Yvette, we find a good correlation between the distribution of 129 I/ 127 I {{and the extent to}} which 129 I releases are expected as a function of the geographical setting. 129 I concentrations, also measured in wines using the same method but with a carrier, show the same pattern...|$|R
