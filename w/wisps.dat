Although some studies have confirmed that <b>WISP</b> 1 is concerned with colon cancer and lung cancer, there is little report about the influence of <b>WISP</b> 1 in traumatic brain injury. Here, we found that the expression of <b>WISP</b> 1 mRNA and protein decreased at 3 [*]d and then increased at 5 [*]d after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Meanwhile, immunofluorescence demonstrated that there was little colocation of <b>WISP</b> 1 with GFAP, Iba 1, and <b>WISP</b> 1 colocalized with NeuN partly. <b>WISP</b> 1 colocalized with LC 3, but there was little of colocation about <b>WISP</b> 1 with cleaved caspase- 3.

40|$|<b>WISP</b> 3 (Wnt Induced Signaling Protein 3) is {{a member}} of the CCN (Cysteine rich 61, Connective tissue growth factor, Nephroblastoma over{{expressed}} protein) family proteins, and expressed in cells and tissues of mesenchymal origin. As suggested and published by the International CCN Society, the alternative name of <b>WISP</b> 3 is CCN 6. <b>WISP</b> 3 maps to human chromosome 6 q- 22 and codes for a 354 amino acid multi-domain protein. Mutations of <b>WISP</b> 3 are associated with Progressive Pseudo Rheumatoid Dysplasia (PPRD) which is characterized by degeneration of cartilage, narrowing of joint space and stunted bone growth at the onset of puberty. Prior investigations suggest that most of these CCN proteins are mainly involved in the regulation of chondrogenesis and angiogenesis. In spite of a number of studies focusing on the functional characterization of <b>WISP</b> 3 in context of chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage growth / development, the detailed molecular mechanism of <b>WISP</b> 3 function remains incomplete. The goal of this thesis work is to explore the function and regulation of <b>WISP</b> 3. Given that <b>WISP</b> 3 has its influence on ROS accumulation and mitochondria are the major site of ROS production, <b>WISP</b> 3 may regulate mitochondrial ROS by influencing mitochondrial functions. Besides, the multi-domain architecture of <b>WISP</b> 3 suggests that it may interact with mitochondrial protein HSP 60 and ATP 5 A 1, and the <b>WISP</b> 3 interaction network may regulate mitochondrial functions. Here, for the first time we found that <b>WISP</b> 3 localizes to mitochondria and depletion of <b>WISP</b> 3 enhances mitochondrial ROS accumulation within physiological limit. Additionally, <b>WISP</b> 3 depletion by siRNA enhances mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial membrane potential, calcium uptake, ROS dependent PGC 1 α expression and mitochondrial mass. We demonstrated that <b>WISP</b> 3 associates with mitochondrial proteins including HSP 60. Upon depletion of <b>WISP</b> 3 expression by siRNA, interaction of HSP 60 with mitochondrial Complex I subunit NDUFB 8 changes, concomitant with enhanced Complex I activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Enhanced ETC activity is documented by elevated Complex I assembly. A similar outcome of <b>WISP</b> 3 depletion using CRISPR-Cas 9 validates that <b>WISP</b> 3 modulates Complex I assembly and thereby mitochondrial function. Transcription factor Nrf 2 counter regulates <b>WISP</b> 3 function through repressing <b>WISP</b> 3 expression. Taken together, our results document for the first time that <b>WISP</b> 3 plays an inhibitory role appropriately balanced by Nrf 2 in mitochondrial ETC complex assembly and activity...|$|R

40|$|<b>WISP</b> 3 (Wnt induced {{secreted}} protein 3) is a multi domain protein {{which is}} expressed mostly in cells of mesenchymal origin and in breast epithelial cells. <b>WISP</b> 3 shares a similar modular structure with existing CCN family proteins Cyr 61, CTGF and NOV along with <b>WISP</b> 1 and <b>WISP</b> 2. Mutations in the <b>WISP</b> 3 gene {{are associated with}} progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia(PPRD), an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder manifested in children at 3 - 8 years of age. Progressive cartilage loss in between articular bone joints and vertebra {{is one of the}} important prognostic factors in patients with PPRD. There is experimental evidence suggesting that <b>WISP</b> 3 promotes the expression of extra cellular cartilage specific matrix proteins such as collagen II and aggrecan. Contemporary literature also suggests that <b>WISP</b> 3 may be involved in regulating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could otherwise damage cartilage integrity. <b>WISP</b> 3 has a putative IGF binding protein domain, but the precise mechanism by which <b>WISP</b> 3 modulates IGF 1 functions with respect to cartilage homeostasis is not known. My experimental results suggest that <b>WISP</b> 3 interacts with IGF 1 and inhibits IGF 1 secretion. In addition, <b>WISP</b> 3 reduces IGF 1 induced collagen X expression and alkaline phosphatase activity most likely through modulating signaling events that promote RUNX 2 transcription factor activation. Furthermore, <b>WISP</b> 3 curbs the IGF 1 induced accumulation of ROS, which in turn potentiates <b>WISP</b> 3 expression. My findings thus indicate that <b>WISP</b> 3 is a potent regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy. It is quite possible that PPRD patients suffer from cartilage loss at least partly on account of uncontrolled chondrocyte hypertrophy {{in the absence of an}} appropriately functional <b>WISP</b> 3 protein and thus strengthen the existing data featuring <b>WISP</b> 3 being important for the maintenance of chondrocyte / cartilage differentiation...|$|R

To clarify this mechanism, we constructed the wild and mutated <b>Wisp</b> 3 expression vectors and transfected into human chondrocytes lines C- 20 /A 4; <b>Wisp</b> 3 proteins subcellular localization, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and <b>Wisp</b> 3 -mediated gene expression were determined, and dynamic secretion of collagen in transfected chondrocytes was analyzed by 14 C-proline incorporation experiment. Mutated <b>Wisp</b> 3 protein increased proliferation activity, decreased apoptosis of C- 20 /A 4 cells, and aggregated abnormally in cytoplasm. Expression of collagen II was also downregulated in C- 20 /A 4 cells transfected with mutated <b>Wisp</b> 3. Wild type <b>Wisp</b> 3 transfection increased intracellular collagen content and extracellular collagen secretion, but the mutated <b>Wisp</b> 3 lost this function, and the peak phase of collagen secretion was delayed in mutated <b>Wisp</b> 3 transfected cells.

We cloned the zebrafish ortholog of <b>Wisp</b> 3 and investigated its biologic activity in vivo using gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Overexpression of zebrafish <b>Wisp</b> 3 protein inhibited bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling in developing zebrafish. Conditioned medium–containing zebrafish and human <b>Wisp</b> 3 also inhibited BMP and Wnt signaling in mammalian cells by binding to BMP ligand and to the Wnt coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 6 (LRP 6) and Frizzled, respectively. <b>Wisp</b> 3 proteins containing disease-causing amino acid substitutions found in patients with PPD had reduced activity in these assays. Morpholino-mediated inhibition of zebrafish <b>Wisp</b> 3 protein expression in developing zebrafish affected pharyngeal cartilage size and shape. These data provide a biologic assay for <b>Wisp</b> 3, reveal a role for <b>Wisp</b> 3 during zebrafish cartilage development, and suggest that dysregulation of BMP and/or Wnt signaling contributes to cartilage failure in humans with PPD. ...|$|R

Previously we demonstrated that <b>WISP</b> 1 is up-regulated in post-infarct heart, stimulates cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and is induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Here we investigated (i) the localization of TNF-α and <b>WISP</b> 1 in post-infarct heart, (ii) the mechanism of TNF-α-mediated <b>WISP</b> 1 induction in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (CF), (iii) the role of <b>WISP</b> 1 in TNF-α-mediated CF proliferation and collagen production, and (iv) the effects of <b>WISP</b> 1 on TNF-α-mediated cardiomyocyte death. TNF-α and <b>WISP</b> 1 expressions were increased in the border zones and non-ischemic remote regions of the post-ischemic heart.

40|$|BACKGROUND: WNT {{inducible}} secreted protein 2 (<b>WISP</b> 2) {{has been}} linked {{with a variety of}} human cancer types and may contribute to cancer metastasis. The current study investigated the importance of <b>WISP</b> 2 in colorectal cancer cells, examining the impact of targeting <b>WISP</b> 2 on Caco- 2 cell invasion and motility together with potential mechanisms of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>WISP</b> 2 expression was targeted in Caco- 2 cells using a ribozyme transgene system and successful knockdown was verified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The impact of <b>WISP</b> 2 knockout (Caco- 2 (<b>WISP</b> 2 KO)) on cell growth, adhesion, motility and invasion was examined using a number of in vitro functional assays. In vitro invasion assays were repeated in the presence of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) inhibitors (FH 535 and IWP- 2) to investigate the role of the WNT-signalling pathway in the regulation of cell invasion by <b>WISP</b> 2. Quantitative-PCR was conducted to measure matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in control [wild-type (Caco- 2 (WT)) and cells containing the empty pEF 6 plasmid (Caco- 2 (pEF 6)) ] and Caco- 2 (<b>WISP</b> 2 KO) cells. RESULTS: <b>WISP</b> 2 knockout resulted in a significant increase in Caco- 2 cell invasion and motility (p 0. 05). Expression analysis of a number of MMPs indicated an insignificant up-regulation of MMP 2, MMP 9 (p> 0. 05) but significant up-regulation of MMP 7 (p= 0. 025) in Caco- 2 (<b>WISP</b> 2 KO) cells compared to controls. Inhibition of WNT signalling using FH 535 and IWP- 2 brought about a significant or borderline significant decrease in Caco- 2 (<b>WISP</b> 2 KO) cell invasion (FH 535 p= 0. 065) and (IWP- 2 p= 0. 002) and negated the pro-invasive effect of targeting <b>WISP</b> 2 in Caco- 2 cells. CONCLUSION: <b>WISP</b> 2 knockout significantly increased Caco- 2 cell invasion and motility. Up-regulation of MMP 2, - 7 and - 9 may indicate that <b>WISP</b> 2 regulates invasion and motility through MMPs. Regulation of invasion by <b>WISP</b> 2 may involve the WNT signalling pathway...|$|R

In mice however, neither absence nor over-expression of <b>WISP</b> 3 {{was found to}} cause a phenotype, and endogenous <b>Wisp</b> 3 expression {{has been difficult to}} detect. To confirm that <b>Wisp</b> 3 knockout mice have no phenotype and to identify potential sites of endogenous <b>Wisp</b> 3 expression, we generated mice with a knockin allele (<b>Wisp</b> 3 (GFP-Cre)) designed to express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and Cre-recombinase instead of <b>WISP</b> 3. Heterozygous and homozygous knockin mice were fertile and indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates, confirming that mice lacking <b>Wisp</b> 3 have no phenotype. We could not detect GFP-expression from the knockin allele, but we could detect Cre-expression after crossing mice with the knockin allele to Cre-reporter mice; the double heterozygous offspring had evidence of Cre-mediated recombination in several tissues. The only tissue that had high levels of Cre-mediated recombination was the testis, where recombination in spermatocytes occurred by early prophase of meiosis I. As a consequence, males that were double heterozygous for a <b>Wisp</b> 3 (GFP-Cre) and a floxed allele only contributed a recombined allele to their offspring. We detected no evidence of Cre-mediated recombination in the female ovary, although when double heterozygous females contributed the reporter allele to their offspring it had recombined ~ 7 % of the time. <b>Wisp</b> 3 (GFP-Cre) expression therefore occurs less frequently and most likely at a later stage of oocyte development in female mice compared to male mice. We conclude that although <b>WISP</b> 3 is dispensable in mice, male mice with a <b>Wisp</b> 3 (GFP-Cre) allele (Jackson Laboratory stock # 017685) will be useful for studying early prophase of meiosis I and for efficiently recombining floxed alleles that are passed to offspring...|$|R

25|$|Emma {{learns that}} Merida needs the wisp {{in order to}} restore her family’s kingdom and save her triplet younger {{brothers}} who were kidnapped by the United Clans of her country after they refused to let her rule as queen. After they make camp for the night, the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tries to guide Emma into betraying Merida once they reach {{the home of the}} <b>wisps.</b> The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tells Emma that once Merida speaks into the Wisp, it will continue to do her bidding until she dies, and thus, the only solution would then be for Emma to kill her. Merida overhears the conversation, and sneaks off to the Hill of Stones by herself. Emma catches up with her in the morning and is goaded by Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, against her better judgment and good nature, to rip Merida's heart out. Before Emma can crush the heart, Hook appears with the others and stops her. Once everything has settled down, Mary Margaret hands Emma the dagger; however, Emma, believing that carrying the dagger would give her too much power, wants someone else to possess it. She decides to give the dagger to Regina, since she would be the only one capable of killing Emma if necessary. Moments later, King Arthur and some of his knights arrive on horseback in order to proclaim that they have been awaiting Emma's arrival. Arthur believes that Emma will be able to reunite them with Merlin, and everyone involved joins forces on their quest en route to Camelot.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was praised, {{particularly for}} the <b>Wisps</b> and its replay value. Al Bickham of Eurogamer considered the game's intertwining of platforming and speed to be successful, and also praised its use of the Wii Remote. Gies, Douglas, and John Meyer of Wired praised the shift from third-person to side-scrolling, which Meyer described as [...] "elegant and cohesive". Matthew Keast of GamesRadar called the <b>Wisps</b> the game's best feature, describing the element of backtracking to previously completed levels after unlocking more types as clever. Tim Turi of Game Informer praised the <b>Wisps</b> for adding [...] "an interesting new gameplay mechanic without succumbing to Werehog-itis", and Gies compared the <b>Wisps</b> to power-ups from the Super Mario franchise, though he felt that Colors still felt distinctive and fresh. Douglas, however, preferred basic platforming over using the <b>Wisps.</b>|$|E

50|$|Harrow {{accepted}} a Roxxon Oil contract to create synthetic automated soldiers; to this end, he again extorted industrial crimes from Will O'The <b>Wisp.</b> Surreptitiously seeking Spider-Man's help, the <b>Wisp</b> instead encountered the hero's clone Ben Reilly, who removed Harrow's implant when the <b>Wisp</b> assumed intangible form, {{but not before}} Harrow forced his catspaw to release Dragon Man from custody. When Harrow remotely guided the powerful android to him, Reilly and the <b>Wisp</b> followed and destroyed Harrow's base.|$|R
40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC), {{which is the most}} common head and neck cancer, accounts for 1 %- 2 % of all human malignancies and is characterized by poor prognosis and reduced survival rates. WNT 1 -inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (<b>WISP</b> 1), a cysteine-rich protein belonging to the Cyr 61, CTGF, Nov (CCN) family of matricellular proteins, has many developmental functions and may be involved in carcinogenesis. This study investigated <b>WISP</b> 1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to elucidate OSCC susceptibility and clinicopathologic characteristics. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze 6 SNPs of <b>WISP</b> 1 in 900 OSCC patients and 1200 cancer-free controls. The results showed that <b>WISP</b> 1 rs 2929970 polymorphism carriers with at least one G allele were susceptible to OSCC. Moreover, compared with smokers, non-smoker patients with higher frequencies of <b>WISP</b> 1 rs 2929970 (AG + GG) variants had a late stage (stages III and IV) and a large tumor size. In addition, OSCC patients who were betel quid chewers and carried <b>WISP</b> 1 rs 16893344 (CT + TT) variants had a low risk of lymph node metastasis. Our results demonstrate that a joint effect of <b>WISP</b> 1 rs 2929970 with smoking as well as <b>WISP</b> 1 rs 16893344 with betel nut chewing causally contributes to the occurrence of OSCC. <b>WISP</b> 1 polymorphism may serve as a marker or a therapeutic target in OSCC...|$|R
