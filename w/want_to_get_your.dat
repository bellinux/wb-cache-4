500|$|Enio Chiola of PopMatters, {{included}} the song {{on his list}} of [...] "Top 15 Madonna Singles of All Time". He opined that [...] " [...] features a more demure Madonna, confident in her termination of a doomed relationship, and the music is accented by characteristically Asian orchestration and lovely poetic lyrics", concluding that [...] " [...] quickly learned that the {{way back into the}} public's collective hearts was to focus more attention on the music than on the frankness of her sexual image". In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling. You may not walk on water after hearing it, but you may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> focus back by walking on broken glass". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] at number 27 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's most successful single to date is a melancholic evisceration of a lover's artifice, and its hopeless plain-spokenness makes it one of the finest examples of 90s balladry". Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track. Although he felt that it sounded [...] "shockingly normal" [...] after the [...] "ambient 'Bedtime Story'", he found the song's length as over-long and deduced it to be [...] "communica no sense whatsoever of the pain of a real goodbye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> name in the papers, be a show horse. But if you want to gain the respect of your colleagues, don't do it. Be a work horse." ...|$|E

6000|$|He rose quickly upon {{recognizing}} his visitor. [...] "I'm {{glad to see}} you, professor; I {{beg your}} pardon for not rising. I thought the knock came from my janitor. Take a seat, please." [...] He gathered a handful of books from a yellow arm-chair and pushed it forward with his foot. [...] "Your visit is most opportune.

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{said the}} Duchess, {{who was in}} high spirits. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> promise now about Silverbridge. Don't mind her. Of course she knows {{everything}}." [...] To be told that any body knew everything was another shock to him. [...] "I have just {{got a letter from}} Mr. Lopez." [...] Could it be right that his wife should be corresponding on such a subject with a person so little known as this Mr. Lopez? [...] "May I tell him that he shall have your interest when the seat is vacant?" ...|$|E
50|$|To use an analogy: if you {{are driving}} a new car you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> {{destination}} cheaply and smoothly, but you also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see how well the car accelerates, brakes and steers so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a better feel for how to drive it, so you will do some test manoeuvers for this purpose. Similarly a dual controller will inject a so-called probing (or exploration) signal into the system that may detract from short-term performance but will improve control in the future.|$|R

[...] "Perhaps I was too easy with the money, and a little slack in other ways. Still, your blood's red, Jimmy, and there's a streak of hard sand in you. You got it from your mother; {{it was she who}} made me. Hard work don't count, boy. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> elbows into the other people who're standing in your way.

5000|$|Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReviews rated The Giancana Story at 7½ out of ten, noting [...] "This {{album is}} not quite as strong as 1998's highly slept on Roots of Evil CD or seminal {{classics}} like Live and Let Die, but if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> first taste of the Mario Puzo of hip-hop, it's a great place to start".|$|E
50|$|What Southport {{is famous}} for is the shit and the piss throwing. Because the inmates {{have no access to}} each other, what they do is fill cups up with shit and piss and throw it at each other. You get caught doing it once, they keep your hands handcuffed behind your back so you can't throw anything. So if you really still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> {{neighbor}} with shit, guess what you do? You put it in your mouth and {{when you get to the}} yard, you spit it on someone.|$|E

5000|$|Criticisms {{of moral}} {{skepticism}} come primarily from moral realists. The moral realist argues {{that there is}} in fact {{good reason to believe}} that there are objective moral truths and that we are justified in holding many moral beliefs. One moral realist response to moral error theory holds that it [...] "proves too much"—if moral claims are false because they entail that we have reasons to do certain things regardless of our preferences, then so too are [...] "hypothetical imperatives" [...] (e.g. [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> hair-cut you ought to go to the barber"). This is because all hypothetical imperatives imply that [...] "we have reason to do that which will enable us to accomplish our ends" [...] and so, like moral claims, they imply that we have reason to do something regardless of our preferences.|$|E

Hayden believed that partisanship should end on election day, and his constituent service was performed in a nonpartisan manner.|$|E
5000|$|Brian Campbell of Starpulse opines that [...] "by {{the end of}} the {{tremendous}} opening track [...] "Life After Anger", you should know just about {{all you need to know}} about Emphatic’s Another Life. Chunky riffs, soaring vocals, and melodic hooks all coated in a glossy, radio ready sheen". However, in Campbell's opinion the album [...] "is plagued by more than a few flat filler tracks, instances in which the band wanders too far into middle-of-the-road hard rock". Also Eric May of New Noise notes the [...] "thundering chorus" [...] and radio potential of [...] "Life After Anger", and reminds his readers that [...] "if you can't get enough of pop-laden hard rock with catchy hooks and memorable choruses, then you might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> hands on this album." [...] Hart of Rock Relapse is less enthusiastic, stating that aside from the change at the head of the band, there's nothing alarmingly new about Emphatic's typical hard rock offerings: [...] "If you’ve heard one Emphatic song, you’ve heard them all".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may hold}} {{me if you}} wish," [...] put in the young auctioneer. [...] "But if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all of <b>your</b> stuff back you had better follow up this Yedley." ...|$|R

5000|$|Proponents for the Keystone XL {{pipeline}} {{argue that}} it would allow the U.S. to increase its energy security and reduce its dependence on foreign oil. TransCanada CEO Russ Girling has argued that [...] "the U.S. needs 10 {{million barrels a day}} of imported oil" [...] and the debate over the proposed pipeline [...] "is not a debate of oil versus alternative energy. This is a debate about whether you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> oil from Canada or Venezuela or Nigeria." [...] However, an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute refers to some studies (e.g. a 2011 study by Danielle Droitsch of Pembina Institute) according to which [...] "a good portion of the oil that will gush down the KXL will probably end up being finally consumed beyond the territorial United States". It also states that the project will increase the heavy crude oil price in the Midwestern United States by diverting oil sands oil from the Midwest refineries to the Gulf Coast and export markets.|$|E
5000|$|... "Right Thru Me" [...] is styled with pop-rap tones, {{and has an}} {{electronic}} beat, while being influenced by R&B. Lyrically, the song describes someone who wonders aloud about how a lover can see the real her. Lyrically, [...] "Moment 4 Life", is about a desire to maintain a feeling of accomplishment, as Drake follows behind Minaj and raps the same theme of enjoying the moment. Straying away from the standard rap song construction of three verses and a hook, Nicki performs a brain-dump of sorts on the track, spitting as if she’s making a speech to both her fans and detractors. [...] "Check It Out" [...] features the nearly constant repetition of the piano and vocal hook from The Buggles 1979 classic, [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star", which is famous for being the first video ever played on MTV. [...] "Super Bass" [...] utilizes electronic music and pop in its composition, while Minaj raps over a hip hop beat, Minaj explained the song's concept, stating: [...] "'Super Bass' is about the boy that you are crushing over, ... And you kind of <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> mack on, but you're taking the playful approach." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Super Bass" [...] was co-written by Minaj, Ester Dean, Roahn Hylton, and Daniel [...] "Kane Beatz" [...] Johnson, who {{produced}} the song alongside JMIKE. While being interviewed by MTV News during the video shoot for the single, Minaj explained the song's concept, stating: [...] "'Super Bass' {{is about the}} boy that you are crushing over, ... And you kind of <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> mack on, but you're taking the playful approach." [...] The song utilizes electronic music and pop in its composition, while Minaj raps over a hip hop beat, while also infusing elements of J-pop combined with an upbeat hook. [...] It uses a busy beat that is interspersed with digital rain drop sound effects and strong bass. Minaj's vocals in the song {{have been described as}} [...] "breathy". [...] "Super Bass" [...] is written in the key of B major with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute. Despite writing in the key of B major, the song has no B major chords. Minaj's lyrics in the song are often provocative and suggestive, with lines like [...] "He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look / Then the panties comin' off, off, uh" [...] and a catchy onomatopoetic refrain: [...] "Boom, badoom, boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass, he got dat super bass".|$|E
