2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what I am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Halfway to Sanity began in early 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, described by Rey as [...] "a dingy place in midtown." [...] For the recording process, drums, guitars, and bass were all recorded {{earlier in the}} afternoon, whereas the vocal track was always recorded {{later in the evening}} with the instrumentals already played. Rey explained that they did this because [...] "it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal, so they did." [...] Joey, however, wanted to work out [...] "how to phrase his singing" [...] and was not a fan of this method of recording. Johnny insisted that no one involved with the album would listen to Rey, not letting him make decisions that needed to made by him as the album's producer. He pointed out that Joey and Richie made it hard for the producer because they wanted to remix or change tracks. Richie, however, stated that Johnny, along with their manager Gary Kurfirst, made the album process difficult by wanting the band to spend as little money possible. He explained that he himself wanted to be more radio-friendly and promote more so they might have a hit album, but Johnny and Kurfirst didn't think it would make a difference. Richie would later recall: [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> want an album to be as successful as it could be? Gary Kurfirst seemed to want to keep the Ramones an underground band, I guess his thinking was, he'd profit more." ...|$|E
