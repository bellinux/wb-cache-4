5|$|The {{first issue}} {{consisted}} of four values released on 20 February 1925; d, 1d, 2d and 6d. Typographed by the Government Printers in Dublin Castle on 'se' <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper.</b> The sheets were printed in larger sheets of 180 {{divided into three}} panes of 60 labels. The second issue had ten values: d, 1d, 1d, 2d, 3d, 5d, 6d, 8d, 10d and 1/-, and were printed on 'e' <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> between 1940 and 1969. Other details are the same.|$|E
5|$|Since 1922, nine Irish {{definitive}} stamp series {{have been}} released. Besides different designs, there were changes involving the watermark and eventually {{doing away with}} <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper,</b> changes in currency were also reflected on the stamps: decimalisation in 1971, and Euro changeover in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The Regular Issue of 1902–03 stamp was {{designed}} by R. Ostrander Smith from a photograph, and was engraved by George F. C. Smillie. It was printed on double-line <b>watermark</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1925 {{saw another}} joint issue of nine values {{similar to the}} 1911 stamps, but this time both pence and centime {{denominations}} appeared on the same stamp. The British version had the pence (or shilling) denomination on the right side, and was printed on the [...] "multiple crown and script CA" [...] <b>watermark</b> <b>paper,</b> while the French version had the centimes on the left, was inscribed [...] "NOUVELLES HEBRIDES", and printed on <b>paper</b> <b>watermarked</b> [...] "R F"; otherwise they appeared identical.|$|R

25|$|Jammu and Kashmir issues: Maharaja Rambir Singh {{introduced}} {{paper money}} on <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> in 1877. The notes {{were not very}} popular and were in circulation for a very short period. The notes carried the 'Sun' motif of the Dogra family.|$|E
25|$|This {{series is}} again {{perforated}} 12, {{and the values}} between 1¢ and 50¢ are printed on single-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper.</b> The 50¢ and $1 issues, however, are instead printed on double-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> {{left over from the}} production of the 1908 series. Denominations not included in this printing are the 3, 4, 5 and 6-cent stamps as there were still adequate stocks of these available. Of special interest is the first appearance of the 7-cent Washington-head, with its premier color of black, issued on April 29, 1914. An estimated 5 million 7-cent stamps were printed, a relatively low number for a definitive issue. It was available in post offices for only five months, for this denomination went through a perforation change in the next series, thus making it a new and separate issue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first}} used in the 1963 {{definitive}} issue for the Chota Sona Masjid. The watermark consisted of a crescent and star. Since 1993, {{it has also been}} occasionally used for commemorative issues. Besides normal watermarks, reversed, inverted (SG996) and reversed inverted (SG476) watermarks are also found on stamps.|$|E
5000|$|Following Singapore's {{separation}} from Malaysia in 1965, revenue stamps were issued {{a year later}} showing the coat of arms. Seven values were issued, ranging from 5c to $5. Between 1969 and 1982 various high-value designs also showing the coat of arms were issued. There are various settings {{when it comes to}} perforation, <b>watermark,</b> <b>paper</b> and size, but the basic set consists of the following values: ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{database}} Profil {{has been}} set up to offer readers studying modern literary manuscripts a reference tool to identify <b>watermarked</b> <b>papers.</b> In the study of writers' drafts as in artists' sketches, the different kinds of papers used provide valuable information on the genesis of a work of art and watermarks, when they exist, are the best visible hint allowing us to identify paper. A multimedia database, with digitized images more precise than usual traced design, seems to be appropriate to register, visualize, and compare modern <b>watermarked</b> <b>papers.</b> Besides its usefulness for specialists, such a database bearing on modern manuscripts should also be conceived in a didactic perspective, as it is oriented towards literary scholars who are not particularly familiar with the history of modern paper. In this paper we present the database Profil which includes a set of digitized images from a collection of betagraphies made by the reproduction service of the National French Library. Then we explain problems of database normalization when human sciences are involved...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} embossing, {{such as that}} {{used to make the}} [...] "cross on oval" [...] design on early stamps of Switzerland, {{resemble}} a watermark in that the paper is thinner, but can be distinguished by having sharper edges than is usual for a normal <b>watermark.</b> Stamp <b>paper</b> <b>watermarks</b> also show various designs, letters, numbers and pictorial elements.|$|R
25|$|The Washington-Franklin {{issues were}} the last U.S. stamps to employ papers bearing the USPS watermark; {{the use of these}} was {{discontinued}} in 1916, during World War I, as a means to reduce expense, as <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> was more expensive than its unwatermarked equivalent and at year's end the difference saved was considerable.|$|E
25|$|This series again {{includes}} Washington-heads on denominations 1-cent through 7-cents and Franklin-heads on the 8-cent through 1-dollar values. It is {{the first}} series to include the 11-cent denomination with the Franklin and Oak leaves design, colored slate-green, which appears again in the following two series of 1916 and 1917. Lower values of the series are printed from plates of 400 on single-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper,</b> while the one-dollar Franklin is printed from plates of 200 subjects and uses double-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> of the appropriate size. Because of stamp separation problems in previous issues using gauge 12 perforations, particularly when attempting to tear a block of stamps from the sheet to cover postage on parcels, this series was instead issued with gauge 10. The perforations of this gauge would soon {{prove to be a}} problem also, as the coarser gauge of perforation made it more difficult to separate stamps, often resulting in torn stamps.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{watermark}} – Each denomination {{is printed}} on uniquely <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper.</b> This may be observed by holding the note {{up to the}} light. In the first series, the standard watermark is a gate/window that is depicted on the note and the denomination, for the €5 of the Europa series, it {{is the face of}} Europa and the denomination as well.|$|E

50|$|The Foreign and Commonwealth Office Collection {{was formed}} by {{instruction}} from the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 23 April 1890 to all territories under his authority. The intention {{was to have a}} record of all Colonial Postage and revenue stamps, postcards, embossed envelopes and newspaper wrappers. The collection contains single examples of the stamps in use at that time as well as some obsolete issues and single copies, usually from first printings, from 1890. Variations such as colour varieties and alternate <b>watermarked</b> <b>papers</b> are included.|$|R
25|$|The Hungarian National Bank {{issued the}} first series of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 pengő {{banknotes}} {{in the last}} days of 1926. These were offset prints on <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> (except for the 5 pengő note). The banknotes featured the outstanding people of the Hungarian history on the obverse and either different sites of Budapest or paintings on the reverse: the banknotes also served education purposes.|$|E
25|$|The first twelve stamps, the low-values up to 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–23 whilst the three high-values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/- {{did not appear}} until 8 September 1937. They were printed by {{typography}} by the Government Printers, Dublin on SE <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper.</b> The designs were: Sword of Light (4 values), Map of Ireland (3 values), Celtic Cross (2 values), Arms of the Provinces (3 values) and St. Patrick (3 high values). A small number of coils with either the horizontal or vertical edges imperf (straight) were issued between 1933 and 1935 including the rare coil in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on January 3, 1911 the Bureau of Engraving and Printing {{issued the}} 1-cent and 2-cent {{denominations}} in imperforate form on single-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> specifically {{for use by}} at least seven different private coil-stamp vending machine companies. Each company used its own distinctive types of perforations, and most firms continued to experiment with them. Thus on the 1-cent issues, these five companies employed a total of 18 different types of private perforations, while 19 types exist on the 2-cent denomination. These private perforations, designed to fit the specific mechanisms of the various vending machines, were applied to imperforate sheets of 400 stamps after those sheets had been cut into either vertical or horizontal strips (the first such sheets had been issued in 1906 {{at the request of}} various vending machine companies). Joseph Schermack is generally credited with producing the first coil stamp vending machine. Privately applied perforations continued to be used well into the 1920s, and comprise a distinctive segment of U.S. postal history.|$|E

5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e <b>watermark</b> <b>paper</b> to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|R

25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
2500|$|The 50-cent and 1-dollar Franklin issues {{made their}} debut on February 12, 1912. These stamps were printed from plates of 200 {{subjects}} {{instead of the}} 400-subject plate used on all lesser denominations. The 200-subject printing plate required paper whose dimensions were compatible with its size and operation. Since there were remaining stocks of double-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> from 1908 intended for plates with 200 subjects on hand, this paper was used for these two issues. When stocks of this paper ran out some two years later, new single-line <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> was cut to the proper size and used. Consequently the 50-cent Franklin occurs on two paper-types in this one series. The 1-dollar Franklin was not printed again on this new paper as existing stocks were ample up to 1916. The 50-cents and 1-dollar Franklin & Oak leaves issues occur again in the following three series of the Washington-Franklin Issue. [...] (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1940 these stamps were {{replaced}} by similar ones but printed on [...] "gaelic e" [...] <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper.</b> Two new values 8d (Sword of Light) and 11d (Celtic Cross) were introduced in 1949. In 1967/8 the 3d (Celtic Cross) and 5d (Sword of Light) changed to being printed in [...] photogravure using a slightly smaller image. Two coil stamps, with imperf vertical edges were also issued.|$|E
50|$|The Arms {{design was}} reissued in decimal {{currency}} in 1967. This time only four values were issued: $4, $6, $8 and $10. These were also valid for postal use and were {{often used to}} mail parcels. There are various <b>watermarks</b> and <b>papers</b> for this issue.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a {{watermark}} {{was made}} by impressing a water-coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing.

25|$|Many {{collectors}} {{ask their}} family and friends to save stamps for them from their mail. Although the stamps received by major businesses and those kept by elderly relatives may be of international and historical interest, the stamps received from family members are often of the definitive sort. Definitives seem mundane but, considering their variety of colours, <b>watermarks,</b> <b>paper</b> differences, perforations and printing errors, they can fill many pages in a collection. Introducing either variety or specific focus to a collection can require the purchasing of stamps, either from a dealer or online. Large numbers of relatively recent stamps, often still attached to fragments or envelopes, may be obtained cheaply and easily. Rare and old stamps can also be obtained, but these can be very expensive.|$|R
2500|$|The second booklet, with a {{released}} {{quantity of}} between 500 and 600, was only sold during the National Seminar on Philately held in Multan in 1992.

Copy No. 4, inscribed [...] "Jerry" [...] on the front cover and given to Geraldine Stutz, was used for a facsimile printing in 1987, and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by Doyle New York.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his works}} on the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{addressed}} {{the relationship between the}} presence of specific <b>watermarked</b> <b>paper</b> and the date of printing, and developed the principle of [...] "runs and remnants". Many bibliographers had argued that the fact that a watermark in a book whose date is in question also appears in a book with a specific date gives no indication (other than a terminal date) for the printing of the undated book because the printer of the dated book could have used old paper which he or someone else had held for many years. Stevenson observed that, while an individual might hold on to a supply of writing paper for a number of years, a printer, for whom the cost of paper for books was his largest capital investment, would ordinarily use paper soon after it was purchased. In fact, [...] "As a rule a particular lot of paper seems to have been obtained and set out for a particular job." [...] Where there is a run of paper with a specific watermark, as opposed to an isolated sheet or two, that should indicate that the book was printed shortly after the paper was manufactured and purchased. In contrast, the presence of a single or few sheets with a particular watermark (a [...] "remnant") might reflect an older paper used, and not be indicative of the actual printing date of a book. Stevenson confirmed this principle by identifying numerous examples of the same watermarks in the Missale Speciale in other dated or datable incunables, the deteriorating states of which fit the chronology of the known dates of the books.|$|E

40|$|Robustness of {{an image}} {{watermarking}} scheme {{is the ability to}} detect the watermark after intentional attacks and normal audio/visual processes. A DWT image <b>watermarking</b> <b>paper</b> embeds a PRN sequence as a watermark in three bands, excluding the low pass subband, using coefficients that are higher than a given threshold T 1. During watermark detection, all the coefficients higher than another threshold T 2 (T 2 ≥ T 1) are chosen for correlation with the original <b>watermark.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we extend the idea to embed the same watermark in two bands (LL and HH). Our experiments show that for one group of attacks (i. e., JPEG compression, resizing, adding Gaussian noise, low pass filtering, and rotation), the correlation with the real watermark is higher than the threshold in the LL band, and for another group of attacks (i. e., histogram equalization, contrast adjustment, gamma correction, and cropping), the correlation with the real watermark is higher than the threshold in the HH band. As the DWT coefficients in the LL band are higher than the DWT coefficients in the HH band, we use a smaller scaling factor for the lower of the two bands...|$|R
