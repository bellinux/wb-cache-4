5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|The commentaries of Ramayana {{suggest that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> for Sugriva to marry the widowed Tara. Amritakataka of Kataka Madhava Yogindra says that this was right as they were animals. The Tilaka by Nahesh Bhatt(Ramavarma) justifies Sugriva's {{marriage}} to Tara since Sugriva was her dead husband's brother. It further states that Tara should remarry as she {{did not belong to}} the first three castes and was young. Tara's action of taking Sugriva as her husband after Vali's death is seen as her attempt to secure the futures of Angada and the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 2010, {{the actor}} {{acquired}} the rights to Stephen Elliott's The Adderall Diaries, with the intention to adapt, direct, and star in the film. It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> for the movie, until he learned of Franco's {{desire to be a}} director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side. The actor also has plans to direct a film version of William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Dec. 2010: 286–88 The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In late 2013 Franco starred in This Is the End as a fictionalized version of himself stuck in a house with Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride, also fictionalized versions of themselves, when the Apocalypse happens.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Enk, {{writing for}} UGO, {{states that the}} myth-making story of Söze's origins is a classic ghost story that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> at home in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, {{academic}} Wayne Wilson explicitly compares Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze can not {{resist the urge to}} show off and create mischief. In The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Lewis Call states that Söze's mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he [...] "represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality." [...] According to Call, Söze's intermediaries – the [...] "usual suspects" [...] themselves – are more useful to the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{was shot}} entirely on {{location}} within England, {{mostly in the}} counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Devon. Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June. Blackpool Mill, a fifteenth-century cottage in north Devon, was turned into Barton Cottage, {{the home of the}} Dashwood girls. The art director for the series, James Merifield, had walked past the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film. He was later sent back to the cottage by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility, and he decided the place <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> for the production. The owners of Blackpool Mill, Sir Hugh and Lady Stucley, were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there. Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "camera crews, production assistants, directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill, turning the rustic four-bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen's novel. Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century, adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows, fake shutters and an extra chimney." [...] The interior of cottage was [...] "a little scruffy" [...] for Mrs Dashwood's status, so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio. Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May.|$|E

Game Informer praised its ball physics and controls, calling them [...] "dead on". GameSpy's Darryl Vassar gave similar praise, {{describing}} the game as a [...] "blast". He added that it had surprising depth. GamePros [...] "Dan Elektro" [...] commented that Ruby & Sapphire would not interest {{those who do not}} have interest in the series, but fans of the series would enjoy its [...] "unusually satisfying" [...] gameplay. Games(TM) praised it for combining pinball and Pokémon, adding that the pinball gameplay {{would be more likely to}} draw those who are not fans of the series into playing Pokémon more so than the adventure games. Eurogamer's Martin Taylor commented that only the [...] "most demanding of pinball wizards <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> to turn their nose up at Pokemon Pinball's charming slant on the genre." [...] Computer and Video Games praised it for its broad appeal, commenting that it is [...] "fast and fluid for the casual player, yet has collecting and evolving for the obsessive." [...] Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire has been compared to other pinball video games, including Mario Pinball Land, which GameAxis Unwired treats as an inferior to Ruby & Sapphire. Eurogamer described Ruby & Sapphire as a spiritual predecessor to Metroid Prime Pinball.|$|E

She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like {{to get to know}} her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists." [...] For the role, Cameron chose Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming Children of the Corn. Rosanna Arquette had previously auditioned. Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Detective Hal Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film. For the special effects shots in the film, Cameron wanted Dick Smith who had previously worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston for the job. Brad Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency where a new agent named Beth Donahue found that Cameron was working on The Terminator and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music. Fiedel was then invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd. Hurd was not certain on having Fiedel compose the score as he had only worked in television music previously, and not theatrical films. Fiedel convinced the two that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> for the job by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that [...] "You know, I'm going to play this for him because it’s really dark and I think it’s interesting for him."
