The partnership of Yorke and Cole {{was starting to}} click, evident in the 6–2 win at Leicester City. Five goals were scored {{in the second half}} including a hat-trick for the former, cutting Chelsea's lead at the top to two points. On 31 January, Manchester United moved a point clear at the Premiership summit {{for the first time in}} the season. Yorke's late header in the 89th minute made the 1–0 victory at Charlton Athletic their third consecutive league win (fifth in the month). Ferguson praised the team's resolve, adding, [...] "It's a good result for us, because there are games <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> dig in and find a result." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston of The Guardian {{received}} the series positively, writing: [...] "Holby City has {{everything you want}} from a hospital drama: good–looking staff, a bit of love interest, a dishy doc, the odd current issue (no beds, badly–paid nurses) and bits <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look away", deeming it: [...] "Pretty good, really." [...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that {{on the strength of}} the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will take a couple of episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{noted that}} there was a greater focus on Moore's {{keyboards}} than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension." [...] He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars [...] "to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs {{that would have been a}} bit cold sounding without that input." ...|$|E
500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have so much more to work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise than you would have with a nice princess or a prince ... <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be ever so careful with the draftsmanship".|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the massacre, the city of San Diego {{increased}} training for special units, and purchased more powerful firearms to better equip police to deal with such scenarios.

5000|$|A {{demonstration}} scenario called [...] "Escape From Zol" [...] {{was released}} {{on the covers of}} Your Sinclair and Zero magazines. It was single-player only and very similar in style to [...] "Ragaril's Domain" [...] <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> escape from a trap-filled building. However, even if the player won, their wizard's experience could not be used in the other five scenarios.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{writers who}} contributed to the show were Bill Manhoff, Mel Diamond, Dale and Katherine Eunson, Ben Gershman, George Tibbles (who later became the head writer on My Three Sons), Fran van Hartesvelt, Bob Ross, Alan Manings, Mathilde and Theodore Ferro, John Whedon and the team of Dick Conway and Roland MacLane, who wrote many of the shows {{for the last two}} seasons. Connelly told an interviewer, [...] "If we hire a writer we tell him not to make up {{situation}}s, but to look into his own background. It's not a 'situation' comedy <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> create a situation for a particular effect. Our emphasis is on a natural story line." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It has {{a rating of}} exactly 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 reviews. Variety wrote that [...] "Hanks is the real reason to see the film and those who enjoyed watching him in Big will find a different, more realized comedian." [...] Roger Ebert wrote that it [...] "makes the fatal mistake of taking stand-up seriously. And if you’re gonna do that, you’d better have good material." [...] One review in The Washington Post read that it [...] "commits the unforgivable sin – it's a movie about comedy that's not funny." [...] Another review in the same newspaper declared that [...] "Seltzer has certainly redeemed his past (ever catch that Six Weeks thing between Dudley Moore and Mary Tyler Moore, or the Jon Voight Table for Five?). He should just avoid projects <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use the word 'bittersweet' – and grab at any others that star Tom Hanks." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Styx {{was accused}} of putting the {{backward}} message [...] "Satan move through our voices" [...] on the song [...] "Snowblind", from Paradise Theatre. Guitarist James Young called these charges [...] "rubbish," [...] and responded, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a statement, we'll {{do it in a way}} that people can understand us and not in a way <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." [...] The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message. In 1983, the band released a concept album, Kilroy Was Here, satirizing the Moral Majority.|$|E

50|$|There {{were three}} Uncle Dick's Annuals issued from 1929 to 1931, dated as the 1930 to 1932 annuals, {{the first one}} being fully named 'Uncle Dick's Competition Annual'. These annuals were aimed more at boys, with action stories and very little Pip & Squeak content.

2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. Here you have the luxury of both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. The real issue is the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E
2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Michaelangelo Matos {{opined that}} [...] "while One Life Stands mindset is Hot Chip's most overtly serious, {{the album is}} also its most musically accomplished. The melodies are Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard's longest-lined, and the melodies often unfurl beautifully." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters viewed it as [...] "Hot Chip's most kinetic album" [...] and stated that [...] "One Life Stand may be less pleasingly idiosyncratic than Hot Chip's previous work, but it pays off in their most consistently winning set of songs to date. It's still not quite as raucous as their incredible live show, [...] but those who felt that Made in the Dark never built up enough momentum ought to find this one's straightforward drive more satisfying." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork named One Life Stand the band's [...] "most consistent and most complete record", but remarked that [...] "it's missing an A-list single on par with 'Boy From School', 'Over and Over', or 'Ready for the Floor'. It's also missing dance songs {{in the mode of}} the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley wrote that the album [...] "sees their familiar pick'n'mix genre-shopping combined with unprecedented levels of Mills & Boon sentimentality. It's a heady cocktail, but when mixed in the right proportions the results are stunning." [...] Jamie Fullerton of NME concluded that the album [...] "does have some of the best songs of the year on it. But, again, waiting for Hot Chip to make that classic album is a bit like waiting for an alcoholic parent to arrive at your birthday party. There's a kind of unconditional love that'll keep you hoping every time one comes around, but there may be a point <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept that it's just never going to happen." [...] Chris Beanland of BBC Music felt that [...] "his is an imbalanced record, and one that leaves you frustrated rather than elated. But despite the blips, they have dished up at least two cerebral bangers here." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent characterised it as [...] "an album full of earnest endeavour, but lacking verve and creative zest." ...|$|E
