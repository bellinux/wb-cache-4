Milk was moderately <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E

Across a seven-year period, the cushion plant S. acaulis showed differing short- and medium-term responses to <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient addition, with the strongest responses often {{coming in the}} combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> nutrient treatment.

40|$|Background: Both climate <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> {{atmospheric}} nitrogen (N) deposition are predicted to affect soil N cycling in terrestrial biomes {{over the next}} century. However, {{the interactive effects of}} <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N deposition on soil N mineralization in temperate grasslands are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: A field manipulation experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition on soil N cycling in a temperate grassland of northeastern China from 2007 to 2009. Soil samples were incubated at a constant temperature and moisture, from samples collected in the field. The results showed that both <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition significantly stimulated soil net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate. Combined <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition caused an interactive effect on N mineralization, which could be explained by the relative shift of soil microbial community structure because of fungal biomass increase and strong plant uptake of added N due to warming. Irrespective of strong intra- and inter-annual variations in soil N mineralization, the responses of N mineralization to <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N addition did not change during the three growing seasons, suggesting independence of <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N responses of N mineralization from precipitation variations in the temperate grassland. Conclusions/Significance: Interactions between climate <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> N deposition on soil N cycling were significant. These findings will improve our understanding on the response of soil N cycling to the simultaneous climate change drivers i...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{scientific}} consensus {{about the risks}} of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change, the mass media frequently portray the subject as one of great scientific controversy and debate. And yet previous studies of the mass public’s subjective assessments of the risks of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change have not sufficiently examined public informedness, public confidence in climate scientists, and the role of personal efficacy in affecting global warming outcomes. By examining the results of a survey on an original and representative sample of Americans, we find that these three forces—informedness, confidence in scientists, and personal efficacy—are related in interesting and unexpected ways, and exert significant influence on risk assessments of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change. In particular, more informed respondents both feel less personally responsible for global <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> also show less concern for global warming. We also find that confidence in scientists has unexpected effects: respondents with high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for global <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> also show less concern for global warming. These results have substantial implications for the interaction between scientists and the public in general, and for the public discussion of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> climate change in particular...|$|R

On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E
