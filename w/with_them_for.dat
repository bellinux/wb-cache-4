5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>For</b> shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E

He resumed playing in the SPL after signing for Livingston on 9 September 2005, on a contract until January 2006, with the option of it being extended for a further three years, following a successful trial. He made his debut two days later in a 4–1 defeat to Hearts, during which he conceded a penalty kick. He made 11 appearances for Livingston, with his last coming in December 2005. Conference National club Exeter City handed him a one-week trial in September 2006, and after training <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> six weeks he was offered a contract until January 2007.|$|E

5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> resources.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Gugelmin, {{like many}} Brazilian drivers of his generation, {{moved to the}} United Kingdom to further his racing career. He was a {{longtime}} friend of future Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, who was already racing in the UK, and the two shared a house from 1982 to 1987. Senna, having previously been a Formula Ford driver with the Van Diemen team, used his influence within the organisation to secure Gugelmin a race seat <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> 1982. By the end of the year, Gugelmin was British Formula Ford 1600cc champion. He followed this up by finishing as runner-up in the British Formula Ford 2000cc series the following year. He moved to the European Formula Ford series in 1984, and won the title at his first attempt. A step up to Formula Three followed in 1985 with West Surrey Racing, winning the British championship and the prestigious Macau Grand Prix. Gugelmin then spent two years in Formula 3000, the final step before Formula One. Gugelmin took one victory in Formula 3000, at Silverstone in 1987 while driving for the Ralt factory team.|$|E

This right is denied to high risk criminals and visitors with histories of drug offenses. There is also a separated, chalet-style house where prisoners can receive visits from family members and stay <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours. The house has a small kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room with a dining table, a sofa, and a television, {{as well as an}} outdoor play area with toys.

5|$|Jane Elizabeth Manning James {{was born}} in Wilton, Connecticut, to Isaac and Eliza Manning. Although, late in James' life her brother Isaac gave her {{birthday}} as 1813, there are source discrepancies that place her birthday anywhere from September 22, 1812, to the year 1820. The Mannings were a free family living in rural Connecticut, and James had at least five siblings including Isaac, Lewis, Peter, Sarah, and Angeline. At the age of six, James was sent away {{to live with the}} Fitches, a wealthy Caucasian family. She was raised by the Fitches' daughter and lived <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the next thirty years. Little is known about James' life with the Fitches other than she worked as a servant: cooking, cleaning, and ironing, etc. While with the Fitches, James was also brought up as a Christian.

5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E

5|$|Simpson's primary {{objective}} for 1967 was overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which– although one of the weakest– would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with Cycling (now Cycling Weekly) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track and {{spend more time with}} his family.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{also known}} as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a range {{conflict}} that took place in Johnson County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county and wipe out the smaller settlements and alleged rustlers. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.|$|E
