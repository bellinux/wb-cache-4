5|$|By 1967 {{many in the}} LSO {{felt that}} Fleischmann <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> exert too much {{influence}} on {{the affairs of the}} orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Hines told a {{journalist}} in June 1939 that he <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> join the Militia and hoped {{to fight in}} another war. He attempted to enlist in the military during World War II, despite being in his 60s, but was rejected. An article published in The Nepean Times during 1943 claimed that Hines had attempted to stow away on a troop ship in 1940, but was found and sent ashore before the vessel sailed.|$|E

5|$|In 1907 {{the company}} <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> wind up the Aston Cantlow Mill Ball and Bearing Company Ltd.

Charles Henry Prideaux was appointed to represent the company on the liquidation committee for Leitner Electrical Company Ltd in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004, {{there was}} {{controversy}} in the Dáil surrounding a definition of 'spouse' when it was claimed that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Coughlan <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> exclude non-married partners from social welfare legislation. The exclusion was a government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a same-sex couple was discriminated against in travel privileges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E

The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year.|$|E

5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} issue with the Steam system, and was something that the company <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they were not aware of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E

5|$|In 204 BC or {{the spring}} of 203 BC, Philip was {{approached}} by Sosibius and Agathocles of Egypt, the ministers of the young pharaoh Ptolemy V. The ministers sought to arrange a marriage between Ptolemy and Philip's daughter in order to form an alliance against Antiochus III the Great, emperor of the Seleucid Empire, who <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> expand his empire at Egypt's expense. Philip, however, declined the proposal and {{in the winter of}} 203 BC-202 BC, he formed an alliance with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire. Philip agreed to help Antiochus to seize Egypt and Cyprus, while Antiochus promised to help Philip take control of Cyrene, the Cyclades and Ionia.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the Somaliland Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> restore British {{control over the}} inland areas of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in Somaliland, the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and make his way home. For his services in Africa, he {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Companion of the Bath, and promoted to brevet Colonel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, {{where it had been}} manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E

5|$|The company {{reported}} a A$64 million loss in its 2008 financial year. By 2009, {{the global economic}} downturn, and regulatory uncertainty associated with MIS schemes, was putting the company under financial pressure, and it <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> improve its situation both through asset sales and refinancing of debt. Its debt levels had risen significantly: it had extended its debt financing with its banks from A$245million to A$350million in 2007. By September 2008 its total debt had ballooned to A$820million, of which A$376million was owed to its lead bankers, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, BankWest and Mizuho. Great Southern had also been hoping to see {{a rise in the}} price obtained for its woodchips, but was unsuccessful in its 2009 negotiations with Japanese customers.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} is completed, and Remmick informs both Picard and Quinn {{that there is}} no sign of wrongdoing, and expresses his interest in joining its crew in the future. Quinn tells Picard that he feels there is an unknown force that has infiltrated Starfleet, and he <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> assure himself of his trust in Picard and the Enterprise crew. To help combat this threat, Quinn offers Picard a promotion to Admiral and a job overseeing Starfleet Academy which would place Picard near Quinn at all times. Picard mulls the offer for some time, but eventually declines.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E

5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> speculate on obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known {{that he was an}} issue in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, and the presence of Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Ngô Đình Nhu {{was known}} to favor an even harder line against the Buddhists. Nhu was the younger brother of President Diệm and his main confidant, and was {{regarded}} as the real power behind the Ngô family's rule. Nhu had made statements calling for {{the suppression of the}} protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. There were persistent reports that Nhu <b>was</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>to</b> usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish Xá Lợi in two hours, and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the American embassy largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.|$|E
