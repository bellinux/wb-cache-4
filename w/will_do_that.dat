500|$|During Microsoft's early history, Gates was {{an active}} {{software}} developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role {{in most of the}} company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, [...] "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that),</b> but because it's a neat hack." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 October, it was {{announced}} that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, would waive all tax on copies sold on the single. He said, [...] "I support the efforts being made by the X Factor contestants and in recognition of that I'm proposing effectively to waive the VAT on the sale of these singles. We <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> by making a donation equivalent to the value of the VAT." [...] Following the single's release, the music video was sent to music channels on 8 November before the fifth live show, when the finalists (excluding Diana Vickers, absent because of illness) sang it again. All the finalists appeared in the video, which also showed still images of soldiers in Iraq.|$|E
500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E

During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would [...] "never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the ’68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Nas {{announced}} that he would release collaboration albums with Mobb Deep, Common, and a third with DJ Premier. Common said of the project in a 2011 interview, [...] "At some point, we <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We'd talked about it and we had a good idea to call it Nas.Com. That was actually going to be a mixtape at one point. But we decided that we should make it an album." [...] Life is Good would be nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Fugazi's early tours {{earned it}} a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its {{powerful}} performances, {{and also for}} the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans {{that there are other}} options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, [...] "You find the Elks Lodge, you find the guy who's got a space {{in the back of his}} pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> stuff because they want to make stuff happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adalgisa tells Norma she {{has fallen}} in love with a Roman, whom she does not name. As she {{describes}} how she fell in love while waiting at the temple and seeing [...] "his handsome face" [...] appear, Norma recalls (as an aside) her own feelings for Pollione ("my passions, too, burned like this"), and more and more, their experiences of falling in love run parallel: (Norma and Adalgisa, duet: Sola, furtiva al tempio / [...] "Often I would wait for him, At the temple, alone and in secret"). Adalgisa pleads for help and forgiveness, and Norma pledges that she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and will also free her from her vows as a priestess: (Norma: Ah! sì, fa core, abbracciami, Perdono e ti compiango / [...] "Yes, take heart, embrace me. I forgive you, and sympathise with you". Adalgisa: Ripeti, o ciel, ripetimi / [...] "Say that again, heavens, say again, Such wonderful words: Through you my long suffering is calmed.") ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara deduced from [...] that Torah study keeps away painful sufferings. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish (Resh Lakish) deduced that painful sufferings {{keep away}} from one who studies the Torah from [...] which says, [...] "And the sons of , reshef, fly upward ( [...] , uf)." [...] He argued that the word , uf, refers only to the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "Will you close ( [...] , hataif) your eyes to it (the Torah)? It is gone." [...] And , reshef, refers only to painful sufferings, as [...] says, [...] "The wasting of hunger, and the devouring of the fiery bolt ( [...] , reshef). Rabbi Johanan said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish that even school {{children}} know that the Torah protects against painful disease. For [...] says, [...] "And He said: ‘If you will diligently hearken {{to the voice of}} the Lord your God, and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> which is right in His eyes, and will give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you that I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the Lord Who heals you." [...] Rather one should say that God visits those who have the opportunity to study the Torah and do not do so with ugly and painful sufferings which stir them up. For [...] says, [...] "I was dumb with silence, I kept silence from the good thing, and my pain was stirred up." [...] "The good thing" [...] refers only to the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "For I give you good doctrine; forsake not My teaching.".|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
