5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> them ominously.|$|E
25|$|At {{the rise}} of the curtain, peasants, {{shepherd}}s and shepherdesses come to rest on the grass after their toil. Among them is a shepherd called Gyges, who plays on his pipe and induces the company to dance. Near him is his betrothed, Clytia, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him tenderly. Gradually the light fades. The peasants look fearfully at the cave and take their departure. Night falls.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an inertial reference frame doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E

500|$|Jesus {{emphasized}} the need for pure thoughts as well as actions, and stated, [...] "Everyone <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" [...] (Matthew 5:28). The Catechism states that, {{with the help of}} God's grace, men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires [...] "for sinful relationships with another person's spouse." [...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse if one looks at him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E
500|$|The {{memory of}} her father {{apparently}} motivated Maria Amélia's dedication to her education. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: [...] "and my father, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me from heaven, shall he be pleased with his daughter?" [...] She was never quite {{able to cope with}} her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Amélia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: [...] "A profound sadness invaded me when contemplating these trees, which had survived my father and probably shall survive all of us. It is an image of human fragility. Man is the most frail of all beings; he dies, while the objects which were seemingly created for his use, endure the centuries!... But I am digressing in my melancholic reflections".|$|E
500|$|... "Nobody's Off the Hook" [...] {{is written}} about the singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson, a {{longtime}} friend of Wainwright's. Citing Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Mahler as influences, Wainwright stated the string arrangements were his first attempt at writing chamber music. [...] "Between My Legs", which Wainwright wrote about a [...] "boy [...] was infatuated with named Tommy Hotpants", is a [...] "fantasy about being able to save your object of desire when the apocalypse comes, and bring him to some sort of hidden paradise." [...] The last 30 seconds of the song contains the opening notes of the title song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, along with a dramatic spoken word part by Siân Phillips. According to Wainwright, [...] "Rules and Regulations" [...] was originally written as a slow ballad for Robert Wilson, and is about the perspective of [...] "someone <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> athletes, but who is not an athlete". [...] "Not Ready to Love" [...] is Wainwright's [...] "surrender to the whole idea of being loved and being able to maintain a relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E
2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to be {{laughing}} and pointing at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, <b>who</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child wrapped in a blanket. Brian is also shown to be laughing and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from a drawer and point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds his hand out to Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E
