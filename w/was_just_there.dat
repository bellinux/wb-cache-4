500|$|Instead {{the band}} hired {{producer}} Tchad Blake, {{known for his}} use of binaural recording. Binaural recording techniques, which employ two microphones to create a 3-D stereophonic sound, [...] were utilized on several tracks, such as the acoustic [...] "Of the Girl." [...] Regarding Blake, Gossard said, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> for us the whole time, wanting us to create different moods." [...] This was the first Pearl Jam studio album following the departure of drummer Jack Irons, and features drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who had previously drummed on Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour.|$|E
500|$|Inglis {{writes that}} through Harrison's {{repetition}} of [...] "It's you that decides" [...] from {{earlier in the}} song, to serve here as his parting statement, [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] becomes [...] "less of an accusation {{and more of a}} plea". On [...] "the most obvious level", Inglis adds, the song [...] "appears to be directed toward McCartney", as well as the divisions within the Beatles that reflect Apple's precarious position in 1969. In a January 2001 interview [...] with Guitar World magazine, Harrison remarked of this period: [...] "At that point in time, Paul couldn't see beyond himself. He was on a roll, but... in his mind, everything that was going on around him <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> to accompany him. He wasn't sensitive to stepping on other people's egos or feelings." ...|$|E
500|$|Drums on [...] "Satan's Bed" [...] were {{performed}} by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On {{the day it}} was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> to play drums and help out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Irons {{became the}} drummer for Pearl Jam in late 1994 {{following}} {{the firing of}} drummer Dave Abbruzzese. His first recording with the band was [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me" [...] for Vitalogy (1994). Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band {{right at the end}} of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> to play drums and help out." [...] Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour-long [...] "pirate" [...] broadcast out of Seattle, Washington which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it. Irons joined the group and played Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the Vitalogy album.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Koestler {{mentioned}} Orwell's [...] "uncompromising intellectual honesty [...] {{made him}} appear almost inhuman at times." [...] Ben Wattenberg stated: [...] "Orwell's writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found it." [...] According to historian Piers Brendon, [...] "Orwell was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days, said his BBC boss Rushbrook Williams, 'have been either canonised– or burnt at the stake'". Raymond Williams in [...] describes Orwell as a [...] "successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way {{and tells the}} truth about it." [...] Christopher Norris declared that Orwell's [...] "homespun empiricist outlook– his assumption that the truth <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> to be told in a straightforward common-sense way– now seems not merely naïve but culpably self-deluding". The American scholar Scott Lucas has described Orwell as {{an enemy of the}} Left. John Newsinger has argued that Lucas could only do this by portraying [...] "all of Orwell's attacks on Stalinism [...] as if they were attacks on socialism, despite Orwell's continued insistence that they were not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with HUMO in 1994, Cousaert claimed the only songwriters were Gaye and Brown and stated Ritz's contribution was the title. In Frankie Gaye's memoirs, My Brother, Marvin, the singer's brother claimed Ritz had told him, [...] "not only are you sexy, your music is healing," [...] inspiring Gaye to write the lyrics himself. Gordon Banks told The Atlantic in 2012 that the conversation between Gaye and Ritz {{had nothing to do}} with Marvin's S collection but because Gaye had been intrigued by Amsterdam's red light district, to which Ritz replied that Gaye needed sexual healing but said he {{had nothing to do with}} the creation of the song. Odell Brown stated he never met Ritz and assumed Ritz <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> for {{an interview}} for Rolling Stone. Though Gaye himself acknowledged Ritz for coming up with the song title, Ritz sued Gaye for $15 million for partial credit. Though Ritz was eventually credited after settling with Gaye's estate following his death, his case was dropped due to insufficient evidence in 1983.|$|E

Ernest Thomas raised that flag. In 1985, he did another interview about the flag-raising (second raising) at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley [...] said incorrectly that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become. He stated {{that he did not want}} to live with the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life.

60|$|Alora, {{although}} she had listened intently to the astonishing conversation, did not quite comprehend what it meant. Janet's harsh statement bewildered {{her as much as}} did her father's subject subservience to the woman. All she realized was that Janet Orme, her dead mother's nurse, wanted money--Alora's money--and her father was reluctant to give it to her but dared not refuse. Money was an abstract quantity to the eleven year old child; she had never handled it personally and knew nothing of its value. If her father owed Janet some of her money, perhaps it was for wages, or services rendered her mother, and Alora was annoyed that he haggled about it, even though the woman evidently demanded more than <b>was</b> <b>just.</b> <b>There</b> was plenty of money, she believed, and it was undignified to argue with a servant.|$|E

I was so interested in Comrade Bickersdyke's statement that the thing had happened to himself that, purely out of good-will towards him, I got up {{and told him that}} I thought it was my duty, as a friend, to let him know that a man named Jerome had pinched his story, put it in a book, and got money by it. Money, mark you, that should by rights have been Comrade Bickersdyke's. He didn't appear to care much about sifting the matter thoroughly. In fact, he seemed anxious to get on with his speech, and slur the matter over. But, tactlessly perhaps, I continued rather to harp on the thing. I said that the book in which the story had appeared was published in 1889. I asked him how long ago it was that he had been on his fishing tour, because it was important to know in order to bring the charge home against Jerome. Well, after a bit, I was amazed, and pained, too, to hear Comrade Bickersdyke urging certain bravoes in the audience to turn me out. If ever there was a case of biting the hand that fed him.... Well, well.... By this time the meeting had begun to take sides to some extent. What I might call my party, the Earnest Investigators, were whistling between their fingers, stamping on the floor, and shouting, [...] "Chestnuts!" [...] while the opposing party, the bravoes, seemed to be trying, as I say, to do jiu-jitsu tricks with me. It was a painful situation. I know the cultivated man of affairs should have passed the thing off with a short, careless laugh; but, owing to the above-mentioned alcohol-expert having got both hands under my collar, short, careless laughs were off. I was compelled, very reluctantly, to conclude the interview by tapping the bright boy on the jaw. He took the hint, {{and sat down on the}} floor. I thought no more of the matter, and was making my way thoughtfully to the exit, when a second man of wrath put the above on my forehead. You can't ignore a thing like that. I collected some of his waistcoat and one of his legs, and hove him with some vim into the middle distance. By this time a good many of the Earnest Investigators were beginning to join in; and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there</b> that the affair began to have certain points of resemblance to a pantomime rally. Everybody seemed to be shouting a good deal and hitting everybody else. It was no place for a man of delicate culture, so I edged towards the door, and drifted out. There was a cab in the offing. I boarded it. And, having kicked a vigorous politician in the stomach, as he was endeavouring to climb in too, I drove off home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Towards {{the evening}} of the second day we judged {{ourselves}} about eight miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in daylight--not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at {{the upper end of the}} reach. Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep--it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deaf--then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>there,</b> standing all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it--all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. 'Good God! What is the meaning--' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims--a little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at 'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around her--and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.|$|E
