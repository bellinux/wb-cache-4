5|$|About 97.5% of the <b>water</b> is saline; the {{remaining}} 2.5% is fresh <b>water.</b> Most fresh <b>water,</b> about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>water</b> {{is vital}} for life, the {{structure}} of this <b>water</b> in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of <b>water,</b> and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure <b>water</b> is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} <b>water</b> to form structures such as <b>water</b> clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed the <b>water</b> to be radioactive {{and potentially dangerous}} to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of <b>Water</b> and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the <b>water</b> is to be diluted with an equal amount of <b>water</b> from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the <b>water</b> up to standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test <b>water</b> from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the <b>water</b> in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the <b>water</b> is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Coral Springs' <b>water</b> supply {{comes from}} the Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's primary source of {{drinking}} <b>water.</b> There are four different <b>water</b> districts within the city; the providers are the City of Coral Springs <b>Water</b> District, Coral Springs Improvement District, North Springs Improvement District and Royal Utilities. The South Florida <b>Water</b> Management District provides flood control protection and <b>water</b> supply protection to local residents, controls all <b>water</b> shortage management efforts and assigns <b>water</b> restrictions when necessary. Collection and disposal of city's trash or garbage is provided by Waste Pro. Electric power service is distributed by Florida Power & Light.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, with <b>water</b> {{eventually}} {{reaching the}} Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} <b>water</b> for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in <b>water</b> shortages at a time when population growth has increased <b>water</b> consumption and begun to create conflict over <b>water</b> distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their <b>water</b> supply.|$|E

5|$|Drinking <b>water</b> in Flagstaff is {{produced}} from conventional surface <b>water</b> {{treatment at the}} Lake Mary <b>Water</b> Treatment Plant, located on Upper Lake Mary, {{as well as from}} springs at the inner basin of the San Francisco Peaks. Groundwater from several <b>water</b> wells located throughout the city and surrounding area provide additional sources of drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> and wastewater services are provided by the City of Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} the <b>water</b> was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in <b>water</b> quality. As Hagley's <b>water</b> was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the <b>water</b> delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million <b>water</b> treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This <b>water</b> treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond <b>Water</b> in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated <b>water</b> to Hagley.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of monitoring of <b>water</b> quality the Brue and Axe are considered together. In 2013 19 <b>water</b> bodies within the area were considered to have moderate <b>water</b> quality with two being poor and four good quality. Agriculture and rural land management is the largest factor affecting <b>water</b> quality followed by the <b>water</b> industry. Transport, industry and manufacturing also have an effect.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh <b>water</b> for the city. <b>Water</b> from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the <b>water</b> {{were allowed to}} settle, removing them from the lake <b>water.</b> After treatment, the <b>water</b> flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the <b>water</b> from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking <b>water</b> for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface <b>water.</b> It is also potentially in drinking <b>water,</b> e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic <b>water</b> breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal <b>water</b> to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public <b>water</b> supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking <b>water.</b> In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking <b>water</b> in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint <b>water</b> crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal <b>water</b> source elevated lead levels in drinking <b>water</b> in domestic tap <b>water.</b>|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and <b>water</b> parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between <b>water</b> hemlock and <b>water</b> parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between <b>water</b> parsnip and <b>water</b> hemlock include the <b>water</b> parsnip having leaves only once compound while the <b>water</b> hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. <b>Water</b> hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which <b>water</b> parsnip lacks. Additionally, <b>water</b> hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while <b>water</b> parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's <b>water</b> supply. <b>Water</b> {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when <b>water</b> supplied by springs is insufficient, <b>water</b> is pumped from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in <b>water</b> supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal <b>water</b> supply system. Various efforts made to augment the <b>water</b> supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E
5|$|Rain is liquid <b>water</b> in {{the form}} of {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric <b>water</b> vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity.

It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as <b>water</b> for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E
