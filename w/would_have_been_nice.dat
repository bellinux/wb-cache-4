Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> {{to learn more about}} the severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice,</b> had it been caught earlier. It was, but she allowed herself to deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E

Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice {{to get a few}} wickets but it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to get a few overs under the belt as well."

He made an immediate return to the Grimsby line-up, starting in their 1–0 home win over League Two team Port Vale in the FA Cup first round on 22 November 2011. His first two-goal haul of the season came in a 3–0 victory at home to Darlington in the FA Trophy first round on 10 December 2011, scoring Grimsby's first and third goals. It was announced on 23 April 2012 that Coulson had rejected a new two-year contract on reduced terms with Grimsby, meaning he would leave the club {{at the end of}} the season.

IGN noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that [...] "they certainly don't make or break the experience." [...] The game's [...] "Power Shots" [...] was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot's Ryan Davis commented that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> {{if you could just}} skip past the animations and keep the wild moves." [...] In general, the game's multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the [...] "predictable and basic" [...] artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. GameSpy noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that [...] "The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix." [...] The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game's accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.|$|E

GameSpot's review of [...] calls it a throwaway feature that could have simply been gutted. Other reviewers were not as negative on the feature's use in later Super Mario Advance games. Despite its use being criticized in most Super Mario Advance games, a GameSpy review called the version found in Super Mario Advance 2 a blast to play in multi-player because it only requires at least two Game Boy Advances, one copy of the game, and a link cable.|$|E

Two weeks after the defeat to Manchester United, Sunderland beat Reading 2–1 on 15 September. Kenwyne Jones and Ross Wallace scored the Sunderland goals in a game which was overshadowed by the tribute paid to 1973 FA Cup Final scorer Ian Porterfield who died on 11 September 2007. Sunderland met Middlesbrough on 22 September in their first north east derby of the season. Grant Leadbitter scored in the 2nd minute to put Sunderland in front, but two ex-Sunderland players; Julio Arca and Stewart Downing put Middlesbrough into the lead. Liam Miller scored an 89th minute volley to save a point for Sunderland. Grant Leadbitter scored his second goal in as many games on 29 September as Blackburn Rovers beat Sunderland 2–1.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down."

We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know.
