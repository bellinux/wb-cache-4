40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{problems}} {{that arise in}} computing degrees of belief, we consider the problem of computing asymptotic conditional probabilities for first-order sentences.

We then consider <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> fraction as N gets large. This extends the work on 0 - 1 laws that considers the limiting probability of firstorder sentences, by considering asymptotic conditional probabilities. As shown by Līogon’kī ĭ [Math. Notes Acad.
