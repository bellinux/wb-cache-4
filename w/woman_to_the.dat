[...] John Paul did not mention the question of ordination of <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diaconate in this document, and reintroducing <b>women</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ordained diaconate was expressly left aside in Declaration on the Question of <b>the</b> Admission of <b>Women</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ministerial Priesthood.|$|R

Dashkova became the director of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg in 1783.

25|$|In January 1002, Sa'id al-Dawla died, {{although}} {{according to}} a tradition recorded by Ibn al-Adim, he was poisoned {{by one of his}} concubines at the behest of Lu'lu'. Along with his son Mansur, Lu'lu' now assumed direct power, at first as ostensible guardians over Sa'id al-Dawla's sons Abu'l-Hasan Ali and Abu'l-Ma'ali Sharif, until, in 1003/4, he had them exiled to Egypt. At the same time, one of Sa'id al-Dawla's brothers, Abu'l-Hayja, fled, disguised as a <b>woman,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine court. Lu'lu' was a capable ruler who maintained the balance between Byzantium and the Fatimids, but after his death in 1008/9 Aleppo gravitated increasingly towards the latter. A Hamdanid restoration attempt, led by Abu'l-Hayja, failed, and in 1015/6 Mansur ibn Lu'lu' was in turn deposed, ending the last vestiges of the Hamdanid rule in Aleppo.|$|E
