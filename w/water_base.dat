25|$|There are {{generally}} {{three types of}} liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a <b>water</b> <b>base.</b> These properties include: rust inhibition, tolerance {{of a wide range}} of water hardness (maintaining pH stability around 9 to 10), ability to work with many metals, resist thermal breakdown, and environmental safety.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some items}} of the {{infrastructure}} requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, <b>water,</b> <b>base</b> metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>based</b> paints contain organic {{solvents}} {{and many}} additives, such as biocides, surfactants, pigments, binders, amines, and monomers. The chemical complexity may introduce new potential health hazards to house painters, in particular irritative and allergic disorders. This study {{was performed to}} compare how house painters experience work with <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints or solvent based paints, and to evaluate whether exposure to <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints increases mucous membrane and dermal symptoms among house painters. 255 male house painters aged 20 to 65 {{were invited to participate}} in the study. Controls were two industrial populations, in total 302 men, without exposure to <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints. Self administered questionnaires were used to assess the painter's experiences of working with different types of paints and the occurrence of symptoms in the exposed and unexposed groups. Hygiene measurements were performed during normal working days when only <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints and no solvent based paints were used. The painters were exposed to low concentrations of dust, metals, ammonia, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds. The work environment was considered better when working with <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints than with solvent based paints. There were more complaints of frequent urination when working with <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paint. Taste or olfactory disturbances were less common. General as well as work related eye and skin irritation was more common among the exposed workers. For other symptoms no significant differences were found. The study indicates that the introduction of <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints has improved the work environment for house painters. <b>Water</b> <b>based</b> paints cause less discomfort and airway irritation than the earlier solvent based paints. Adverse general health effects seem low. Some of the painters may have dermal symptoms caused by the components in <b>water</b> <b>based</b> paints...|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{techniques}} {{can be broken}} down into two major categories: Oil <b>based</b> and <b>water</b> <b>based</b> cooking techniques. Both oil and <b>water</b> <b>based</b> techniques rely on the vaporization of water to cook the food. Oil based cooking techniques have significant surface interactions that greatly affect the quality of the food they produce. These interactions stem from the polar oil molecules interacting with the surface of the food. <b>Water</b> <b>based</b> techniques have far less surface interactions that affect the quality of the food.|$|R
