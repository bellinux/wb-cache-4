500|$|David Potter {{concludes that}} the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were [...] "the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration...

He opposed various attempts, including the Olive Branch Petition, aimed at trying to find peace between the colonies and Great Britain, writing, [...] "In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory Measures We can adopt."
