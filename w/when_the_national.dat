5|$|The {{first serious}} {{interest}} in the road came in mid-1969, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Park Service approved a plan to develop the facilities with Amistad.

Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, in an attempt to increase tourism.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the park}} was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was {{converted}} to recreational use starting in 1902, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Guard added fields for polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground, where they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.|$|E
5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe.

After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days. In 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Australian Government greatly {{expanded}} its powers {{in order to}} better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both men and women were ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940 and was {{greatly expanded}} during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, {{officials}} in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for {{the western end of}} Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near Sabine Pass in Jefferson County, Texas, though few left. Also, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana, just three hours before tropical storm winds were observed.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

5|$|The Hall of Fame {{was created}} to honor the role St. Louis played in helping to {{establish}} professional wrestling in North America. Matysik also {{wanted to create a}} hall of fame that recognized wrestlers for their contributions to wrestling rather than their relationships with the owner of the promotion. To be inducted into the Hall of Fame, inductees must have held a title belt or {{played an important role in}} or around the Missouri area between 1959 and 1983, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Wrestling Alliance (NWA) had a strong presence in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E

The library has a ceiling painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented ceiling being attributed to Giorgione.|$|E
50|$|In {{opposition}} from 1972 to 1975, Nixon {{was a prominent}} figure in persuading his National Party colleagues to help pass Australian Labor Party legislation opposed by the Nationals' coalition partner, the Liberal Party. This helped prove to voters <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Party's independence from the Liberal Party and in cases such as <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nationals</b> supported Labor's policy on educational grants to public schools, helped to show <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Party's connection with core voter issues. Nixon was also a longtime critic of {{what he saw as}} bias by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation against <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Party.|$|R
