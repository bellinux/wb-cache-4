40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>noise</b> is {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} noise sources limiting the astrophysical reach of Advanced LIGO (once commissioning is complete) and third-generation detectors. Adopting crystalline materials for thin, reflecting mirror coatings, rather than the amorphous coatings used in current-generation detectors, could potentially reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>noise.</b> Understanding and reducing <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> requires accurate theoretical models, but modeling <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> analytically is especially challenging with crystalline materials. <b>Thermal</b> <b>noise</b> models typically rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the power spectral density of the <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> to an auxiliary elastic problem. In this paper, we present results from a new, open-source tool that numerically solves the auxiliary elastic problem to compute the Brownian <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> for both amorphous and crystalline coatings. We employ open-source frameworks to solve the auxiliary elastic problem using a finite-element method, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel processing that enables us to use high resolutions capable of resolving the thin reflective coating. We compare with approximate analytic solutions for amorphous materials, and we verify that our solutions scale as expected. Finally, we model the crystalline coating <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> in an experiment reported by Cole and collaborators (2013), comparing our results to a simpler numerical calculation that treats the coating as an "effectively amorphous" material. We find that treating the coating as a cubic crystal instead of as an effectively amorphous material increases the <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> by about 3 %. Our results are a step toward better understanding and reducing <b>thermal</b> <b>noise</b> to increase the reach of future gravitational-wave detectors. (Abstract abbreviated.)
