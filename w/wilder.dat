5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} {{were to be}} sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, <b>Wilder,</b> Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and <b>Wilder</b> had to sign five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with <b>Wilder</b> and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, <b>Wilder</b> had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes.

5|$|In 1963, <b>Wilder</b> {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced <b>Wilder</b> to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks.

Brooks elicited a promise from <b>Wilder</b> that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and <b>Wilder</b> toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, <b>Wilder</b> was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and <b>Wilder</b> was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E
