30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{development}} of the field of tribology, and highlight some of the main problems encountered in this area, such as lack of systematicness, loose correlation, and inadequate focus on the microscopic perspective. Then, we provide basic formulas of frictional mechanics while considering the friction effect on classical mechanics formulae. In order to carry out the frictional mechanics analysis, we first classify the interface. According to the size analysis of surface films, the manufacturing roughness of the surface, the contact width, and the roller radius of the rolling contact bearing, frictional mechanics has the features of interface mechanics, while interfaces are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} a medium. Based on the classification, we further analyze the pressure and frictional stress of sliding and rolling friction problems without a medium, such as a slider, <b>wedge</b> <b>key,</b> and V belt. We also analyze problems with a medium, such as journal and rolling contact bearings. By comparing these results with those of classical mechanics without considering friction, we see that (1) friction causes deviations in the result for classical mechanics which does not consider friction, and (2) if the frictional stress and normal pressure affect each other, their interaction should be considered simultaneously. Finally, we summarize the friction problems, namely, sliding and rolling, with and without a medium, and deformed and non-deformed. From our analysis, we propose two conclusions. First, the frictional mechanics problem is a deviation of the classical mechanics problem, and secondly, frictional stress and normal pressure influence each other.|$|E

The main tool hereby is Doob's formula which gives the probability that Brownian motion started inside a wedge does not hit this <b>wedge.</b> Other <b>key</b> ingredients are the time inversion property of Brownian motion and the time reversal property of diffusion bridges. Secondly, this methodology can also be applied for the three dimensional Bessel process. Thirdly, we consider Bessel bridges from 0 to 0 with dimension parameter δ> 0 and show that the probability that such a Bessel bridge crosses an affine boundary {{is equal to the}} probability that this Bessel bridge stays below some fixed value.

40|$|Tooth {{separation}} and <b>wedging</b> remain <b>key</b> concerns in planetary gears sets design. These {{may lead to}} anomalous in-service conditions and cause premature tooth damage and bearings failure. Damage is related to planets loads sharing which in turn depends on assembly errors and functional parameters of the used design solutions. This paper assesses {{the effects of the}} assembly errors and planets bearings clearance on the planets load sharing. The analysis focuses planetary gears sets used in wind power plants where these issues are particularly crucial. The effects of randomly distributed bearings clearances and misalignments are investigated using a simplified probabilistic approach. The study, carried out by means of a two-dimensional lumped-parameter model enabling both tooth {{separation and}} wedging, demonstrates a significant impact of the non uniform clearances distributions and assembly errors on the load sharing...|$|R

However, the Nega End is stopped by the Goseigers' Gosei Global technique, putting an end to Brajira's scheme.|$|R
40|$|Standard DSGE small {{open economy}} models can not {{generate}} the cyclical properties of middleincome countries (MICs). These models, {{compared to the}} data, predict excessive consumption smoothing, low procyclicality of investment and procyclical, instead of counter cyclical, real net exports. Previous studies have solved this problem by increasing the persistence of shocks or by lowering the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. This paper tackles it by introducing market imperfections relevant for MICs into an otherwise standard model. More specifically, we build a model with limited access to the foreign capital market, identified as an external borrowing constraint, and asymmetric financing opportunities across tradable and non-tradable sectors, identified as sector-specific labor financing <b>wedges.</b> The <b>key</b> parameters associated to these frictions are deduced to replicate selected data for Chile between 1986 and 2004. We find that the external borrowing constraint makes investment and consumption of tradable goods more procyclical and volatile, making real net exports counter cyclical. However, it produces counter cyclical employment and a low volatility of consumption of non tradable. Introducing sectorspecific labor financing wedges enables the model to reproduce these moments as well. ...|$|R

I utilize voters ‟ decisions to turn out as the dependent variable and control for respondents ‟ positions on terrorism, the economy, same-sex marriage, political interest, party identification, and socioeconomic status.

40|$|We have {{performed}} an extensive analysis of auroral optical events (substorms) {{that occurred during}} the development of the main phase of magnetic storms. Using images from the Earth Camera on the Polar spacecraft (Frank et al., 1995), we compared the optical emission features of substorms occurring during 16 expansion phases of magnetic storms with the features of isolated substorms occurring during non-storm times. The comparison used two techniques, visual inspection and statistical comparisons. The comparisons were based on the common characteristics seen in isolated substorms that were initially identified by Akasofu (1964) and quantified by Gjerloev et al. (2008). We find that when auroral activity does occur during main phase development the characteristics of the aurora are very dissimilar to those of the classical isolated substorm. The primary differences include the lack of a surge/bulge, lack of bifurcation of the aurora, much shorter expansion phases, and greater intensities. Since a surge/bulge and bifurcation of the aurora are characteristics of the existence of a substorm current <b>wedge,</b> a <b>key</b> component of the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system during substorms, the lack of this component would indicate that the classical substorm model does not apply to the storm time magnetosphere-ionosphere current system. Rather several of the analyses suggest that the storm-time substorms are associated more closely with the auroral oval, at least spatially, and, therefore, probably with the plasma sheet dynamics during the main phase development. These results then must call into question the widely held assumption that there is no intrinsic difference between storm-time substorms and classical isolated substorms...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{vertebral}} <b>wedging,</b> a <b>key</b> structural characteristic of spinal curvatures, {{has recently been}} found to be negatively related to vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA). The purpose of this longitudinal {{study was to examine the}} relation between vertebral cross-sectional growth and vertebral wedging progression within the immature lumbar spine. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the potential association between increases in lumbar vertebral CSA and changes in L 5 vertebral wedging in 27 healthy adolescent girls (ages 9 - 13 years) twice within a two-year period. Vertebral CSA growth was negatively associated with changes in posteroanterior vertebral wedging (r = - 0. 61; p = 0. 001). Multiple regression analysis showed that this relation was independent of gains in age, height, and weight. When compared to the 14 girls whose vertebral wedging progressed, the 13 subjects whose vertebral wedging decreased had significantly greater vertebral cross-sectional growth (0. 39 ± 0. 25 vs. 0. 75 ± 0. 23 cm 2; p = 0. 001); in contrast, there were no significant differences in increases in age, height, or weight between the two groups. Changes in posteroanterior vertebral wedging and the degree of lumbar lordosis (LL) positively correlated (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 002) -an association that persisted even after adjusting for gains in age, height, and weight. We concluded that in the immature skeleton, vertebral cross-sectional growth is an important determinant of the plasticity of the vertebral body; regression of L 5 vertebral wedging is associated with greater lumbar vertebral cross-sectional growth, while progression is the consequence of lesser cross-sectional growth...|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} the trench-parallel component of plate motion on the active fault system within the Nankai accretionary wedge from reflection seismic profiles, high-resolution seafloor bathymetry, and deep-towed sub-bottom profiles. Our study demonstrated that {{a large portion of the}} trench-parallel component of oblique plate subduction is released by strike-slip motion along a fault located just landward of and merging down-dip with a mega-splay fault. The shallow portion of the splay fault system, forming a flower structure, seems to accommodate dominant strike-slip motion, while most of the dip-slip motion could propagate to the trenchward décollement. Numerous fractures developed around the strike-slip fault release overpressured pore fluid trapped beneath the mega-splay fault. The well-developed fractures could be related to the change in stress orientation within the accretionary wedge. Therefore, the strike-slip fault located at the boundary between the inner and outer <b>wedges</b> is a <b>key</b> structure controlling the stress state (including pore pressure) within the accretionary prism. In addition, the strike-slip motion contributes to enhancing the continuous mega-splay fault system (outer ridge), which extends for approximately 200 km parallel to the Nankai Trough.|$|R
40|$|Primitive, mantle-derived magmas provide {{important}} {{clues about the}} formation and equilibration conditions of magmas at depth. In subduction zones, it is uncommon for primitive magmas to ascend through the shallow mantle and crust without undergoing chemical modification. Instead, magmas commonly differentiate through fractional crystallization, crustal assimilation, or magma mixing. Those rare primitive lavas that do erupt along a volcanic arc are useful for elucidating subduction-related processes within the mantle wedge (~ 30 – 80 km depth) and {{are the focus of}} this research. I used piston-cylinder apparatuses to investigate the high-pressure, high-temperature, H 2 O-undersaturated phase equilibria for several primitive compositions that have erupted at volcanic arcs. I aimed to reveal the permissible residual mantle mineralogy, as well as the P-T- H 2 O conditions over which the putative mantle melts last equilibrated before erupting. My work focuses on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), where primitive compositions span a range of SiO 2, total alkalies (K 2 O+Na 2 O), magmatic H 2 O, and incompatible trace element enrichments. Variations among these components are presumed to result from melting heterogeneous mantle that has been affected, to varying degrees, by a subduction component. Chapter III focuses on the phase equilibria of a Mexican basaltic andesite and an Aleutian basalt. Results show that hydrous basaltic andesite equilibrated with harzburgite in the shallow mantle, whereas the basalt equilibrated with lherzolite. The former appears more common in continental arcs and the latter in intraoceanic arcs. Chapter IV focuses on two alkaline lavas of varying K 2 O content from the TMVB that are transitional between potassic, hydrous minette and H 2 O-poor intraplate alkali basalt. Experimental phase relations and trace element modeling reveals that melting and/or mixing of peridotite and clinopyroxene-rich veins are likely involved in producing these transitional lava types. These experimental data are integrated with other petrologic and geophysical data to provide an along-arc perspective of mantle-melt equilibration in the TMVB. Primitive melts appear to commonly equilibrate with chemically heterogeneous mantle at depths above the "hot nose" of the mantle wedge. It is apparent that the shallow mantle <b>wedge</b> is a <b>key</b> component for understanding the geochemical complexities of subduction zone magmas.
