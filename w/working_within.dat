5|$|The Czech {{government}} {{had made a}} decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning to have the system <b>working</b> <b>within</b> two years. As police are obliged to revoke a gun license when the licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in a period of three years, the central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke the license long before the murders.|$|E

5|$|The second {{operation}} {{takes them}} to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian informant named Nikolai <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian Loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group {{to make their way}} through enemy territory with support from an AC-130 gunship before they can be extracted. Intelligence gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.|$|E
5|$|To the Edge of the Earth {{was printed}} on {{post-consumer}} waste paper using minimal {{volatile organic compound}} inks and included a package made of ecological friendly materials. The photography for the extended play was handled by Jacques Descloitres, a photographer <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, with additional works produced by the band's previous collaborator Sean Mosher-Smith of the Echo Designlab. Descloitres provided satellite images of {{different areas of the}} Arctic Circle based largely on observations from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{met with}} Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who {{had built the}} China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and {{it was agreed that}} Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant <b>working</b> <b>within</b> 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come. Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used.|$|E
5|$|Harley later {{also joined}} the AIS-AFL Academy as an {{assistant}} coach and mentor. Prior to the 2010 AFL season, it was further announced that Harley would join the Channel 7 network football commentary team, replacing Nathan Buckley in the leading special comments role. Harley admitted that his previous experience as a regular panellist on the football program One Week at a Time during his playing days had fuelled an interest in <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the media industry.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins <b>working</b> <b>within</b> five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working.

5|$|On {{the opening}} day of free agency, Hodgson signed a one-year {{contract}} with the Nashville Predators. Hodgson made the opening night roster of the Predators to begin the 2015–16 season. He was used primarily in a depth role, centering the fourth-line. After posting 8 points in 39 games, Hodgson was placed on waivers by the Predators on January 13, 2016. Hodgson passed through waivers unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals the following day. Hodgson was not offered a new contract by the club, and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On October 3, it was announced that Hodgson had retired and would be <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the Predators organization, coaching for their Little Preds Learn to Play Program.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. <b>Working</b> <b>within</b> the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E

5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory {{that he would}} have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while <b>working</b> <b>within</b> or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|The term {{in office}} of Senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850. He sought reappointment, but he had aligned himself too {{strongly}} with the Fire-eaters, and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state. The moderates who favored <b>working</b> <b>within</b> the Union still dominated Florida politics, and they successfully sought to put Mallory {{in place of the}} radical Yulee. The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular, and Yulee protested, carrying his protest {{all the way to the}} Senate itself. That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory, and so he was seated.|$|E
