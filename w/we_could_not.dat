5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E

25|$|Anaximander {{put forward}} {{the idea that}} humans had to spend part of this {{transition}} inside the mouths of big fish {{to protect themselves from}} the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales. He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} account available, written by Melchior Estácio do Amaral in 1604: the sea was purple with blood dripping from the scuppers, the decks cluttered with {{the dead and the}} fire raging {{in some parts of the}} ships, and the air so filled with smoke that, not only we could sometimes not see each other but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> recognize each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the short Vita Tibulli, found {{at the end of}} the Ambrosian, Vatican and {{inferior}} manuscripts, has been much discussed. There is little in it that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> infer from Tibullus himself and from what Horace says about Albius, though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from Suetonius's book De Poetis. It is another moot question of some importance whether our poet should be identified with the Albius of Horace (Od. i. 33; Epist. i. 4), as is done by the Horatian commentator Pomponius Porphyrion (AD 200-250) in his Scholia. Porphyrio's view was examined by Postgate (Selections from Tibullus, appendix A).|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} all very well, Captain Forster, if we were all men," [...] Mr. Hunter said. [...] "There are sixteen of us and there are in all {{eighteen}} horses, for I and Farquharson have two each; but there are eight women and fourteen children; so all the horses would have to carry double. <b>We</b> certainly <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hope to escape from them with our horses so laden; and if {{they came up with}} us, what fighting <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do with women behind our saddles? Moreover, <b>we</b> certainly <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave the servants, who have been true to us, to the mercy of the Sepoys." ...|$|R

3000|$|..., whereas {{there is}} not any {{meaningful}} explanation for this unexpected result, <b>we</b> still <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find {{the main reason for}} this situation, but the same result is obtained for more than three times run of the simulation program.|$|R
25|$|And the captain-general {{wished to}} {{approach}} the largest of these three islands to replenish his provisions. But it was not possible, {{for the people of}} those islands entered the ships and robbed us so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> protect ourselves from them. And when we wished to strike and take in the sails so as to land, they stole very quickly the small boat called a skiff which was fastened to the poop of the captain's ship. At which he, being very angry, went ashore with forty armed men. And burning some forty or fifty houses with several boats and killing seven men of the said island, they recovered their skiff.|$|E
25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|Foch {{was pleased}} at Wilson’s appointment, {{although}} Haig {{noted in his}} diary (25 February) that Wilson was no longer so keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig’s unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig’s attitude was “very stupid & short sighted but agreed <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> force Haig at this moment“. Wilson defended Haig’s position to the War Cabinet (6 March) and blamed Clemenceau and Petain (both of whom disliked Foch) and wrote in his diary that the British government {{had little choice but}} to back Haig “wrong as I believe him to be”. At a SWC Meeting in London (14–15 March) Foch agreed under protest to shelve the Allied Reserve.|$|E
60|$|It was, for aught <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see. <b>Not</b> a light showed anywhere; and to {{make things}} worse the moon had {{abandoned}} us. For one good hour we swept through chaos to the tuneless lamentations of Sheepshanks, who declared that his collar-bone was broken.|$|R

[...] "Road signs were always masked and replaced with period signage. Part of my kit {{when we were on}} location was large amounts of camouflage netting, because some stuff <b>we</b> just <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remove, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only disguise, so this netting was quite popular." ...|$|R

25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her impulsiveness. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have accomplished that with a dozen speeches.

500|$|According to the rowing {{correspondent}} of The Times, it was [...] "one of {{the greatest}} battles {{in the history of}} the race". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Masser said [...] "I cannot speak too highly Oxford's magnificent row.

5000|$|In {{hospital}} situations, {{cable management}} can {{be critical to}} preventing medical mistakes.

6000|$|... "I don't expect <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do {{it without}} noise," [...] Jack said. [...] "Besides, they have got pistols, and <b>we</b> {{certainly}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> master them without their being able to shout. We might manage one easy enough, if one sprang on him and held his arms and prevented him getting his pistol, and another clapped {{his hands over his}} mouth; but the three of us <b>could</b> <b>not</b> manage two silently. Besides, I should not like to hurt them after their bringing us that water to wash in." ...|$|R
60|$|There seemed but {{one thing}} to do; that was to keep on sailing {{straight}} before the wind--since <b>we</b> <b>could</b> travel most rapidly along that course--until we sighted land of some description. If it chanced to be the mainland, well and good; if an island--well, we might live upon an island. <b>We</b> certainly <b>could</b> <b>not</b> live long in this little boat, {{with only a few}} strips of dried thag and a few quarts of water left.|$|R
500|$|Ante Marković has {{described}} {{that after the}} Presidency meeting failed to achieve the results the Army wanted that Kadijević met with him with the proposed coup d'etat against the secessionist republics. During the meeting Marković responded to Kadijević {{by saying that the}} plan failed to arrest Milošević. Kadijević replied [...] "He is only one fighting for Yugoslavia. Without him, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be proposing this." [...] Marković rejected the plan and afterwards communication between Kadijević and Marković broke down.|$|E
500|$|After he too {{had been}} exiled the {{following}} year, Thi said [...] "It {{was necessary to}} move against him because our army was dependent on the Americans, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get along without them." [...] Thi accused overseas-based Diệm supporters for the coup. Despite his failure to take power, Khiêm said Khánh’s demise made him [...] "very happy. I think my objective has been realized." [...] The Soviet Union responded to the coup by saying [...] "The farce will go on" [...] and lampooning South Vietnam's [...] "bankrupt politicians and warriors".|$|E
500|$|The planned North American {{tour was}} cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan {{would join the}} group as his replacement, the {{remaining}} members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, [...] "We wish it to be known {{that the loss of}} our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> continue as we were".

30|$|In this case, {{the patient}} showed no {{symptoms}} of airway obstruction or dysphagia in preoperative interviews. Moreover, no abnormality {{in the oral}} cavity was apparent on ocular inspection. <b>We</b> thus <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have predicted the difficult intubation preoperatively. Fortunately, mask-ventilation proved easy, and intubation was safely achieved by displacing the mass under video laryngoscope.|$|R
500|$|Webb said [...] "We {{could hear}} the pilot {{shouting}} for help". He and Richards climbed into the burning wreckage and rescued the pilot, who warned them that there were police dogs in cages in the plane that might be dangerous if they were loose, as their handlers were {{in the rear of}} the plane. The pilot asked Webb and Richards to help the 10 men in the tail of the aircraft. But, as Richards told a local newspaper [...] "this was just a mass of flames and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get near it".|$|E
500|$|While on {{the trail}} in Iowa on November 20 Dodd criticized fellow {{candidates}} who threatened to cut off funding to Pakistan in light of President Pervez Musharraf's suspension of the constitution. He stated [...] "I think it's a very dangerous thing to suggest at this point. We could find ourselves cut off. ... <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get into Afghanistan except through Pakistan. So {{in addition to the}} issue of nuclear weapons, and who controls them, and a state hostile to our interest, {{you have to be careful}} how much you threaten." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "establishment of {{religion}}" [...] {{clause of}} the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church.

But if we have a good house waiting for us, and are able to entertain nicely, we can attract the best people, and--and--really do some good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However, many of {{the stories}} that <b>we</b> heard <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be {{explained}} on these grounds, and the fakir and his doings were often talked over at mess, some of the officers scoffing at the whole business, others maintaining that some of these fakirs had, in some way or another, the power of foretelling the future, citing many well authenticated anecdotes upon the subject.|$|R
