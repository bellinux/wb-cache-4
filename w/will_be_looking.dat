5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

2500|$|The North Vietnamese Air Force began {{receiving}} the MiG-19 {{at the end}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, which ended in 1968. Despite their limited numbers, MiG-19s were involved in extensive combat during Operations Linebacker 1 and Linebacker 2 (a.k.a. the Christmas Bombing). The NVAF claimed only seven victories over U.S. aircraft, using the MiG-19, all of which were F-4 Phantom IIs. The MiG-19 was tested by U.S. pilots in the United States in 1969 after receiving a Chinese J-6 (F-6 exported model) from Pakistan. [...] In addition to finding the aircraft to have a good canopy allowing good visibility for the pilot, along with 3 hard hitting 30mm cannons, U.S. pilots found the MiG-19 (J6/F6) to be an excellent fighter, [...] "like the MiG-17, it could easily out-turn the Phantom...and could out-accelerate the F-4 out to Mach 1.2, but was slower than the MiG-21.". [...] However, the MiG-19's strongest fault was its extremely short range, as one U.S. test pilot remarked, [...] "after going in full after-burner at low altitude for 5 minutes, the MiG driver <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a place to land!" [...] This, combined with the aircraft's twin engines, which were difficult to maintain, made the MiG-19 unpopular with North Vietnamese pilots.|$|E
2500|$|After rescuing Hiro Nakamura in [...] "Game Over", Noah has Hiro {{take him}} back to the Evo Summit to save Claire and stop the bombing. After {{watching}} his past self be taken away by Erica Kravid, Noah is found by Angela Petrelli who informs him that Claire has been rushed to the hospital and is in surgery. While Hiro attempts to stop the bomb, Noah rushes to the hospital with Angela only to learn that Claire has died giving birth to twins. Noah says a tearful goodbye to Claire who doesn't revive for some reason. Hiro appears to him afterwards and informs him that he can't stop the bomb, there are too many variables and any attempt to stop it results in a worse future. As Hiro and Noah prepare to return to their own time, Phoebe Frady unleashes a massive wave of darkness that drains Hiro's powers shortly before Harris bombs the summit. Returning to Claire's children, Angela informs Noah that the Earth's magnetic poles will soon reverse and solar flares will wipe out all life on Earth. Erica Kravid only intends to save those she wants and Angela has foreseen that one or both of Claire's children hold the key to saving the world. Noah realizes he had his memory wiped to protect Claire's children from Erica Kravid and decides that the safest place for them is in the past where they can grow up and prepare for their destiny. When they reach the correct time, Erica <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for toddlers, not teenagers. Hiro reluctantly agrees to take Angela back to 1999 to fulfill Noah's request while Noah intends to erase all security footage of the babies. Before Hiro and Angela leave, Noah and Angela name the babies as Claire never got to: Angela names Claire's son Nathan after Nathan Petrelli while Noah names Claire's daughter Malina after his own mother. After Angela, Hiro and the children are gone, Noah realizes that Erica is in the hospital and goes after her to kill her. His past self, having escaped with the help of Caspar Abraham, spots Noah and chases him down.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
