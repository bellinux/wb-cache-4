50|$|Architecturally, {{the church}} {{belongs to the}} Morava school. The ground plan {{is in the form}} of a floral inscribed cross, {{combined}} with a trefoil. The twelve-sided dome above the central space rests on four free standing pillars. At the eastern end there are one large and two small apses, whereas two large choir conches flank the altar. Above the corners of the church there are four little octagonal domes. The narthex consists of nine bays. Above the central bay there is yet another dome that rests on four pillars. The church was built on ashlars and thin mortar beds. The facade decoration includes low pilasters, engaged colonettes on the conches and apses, as well as a frieze of small blind arcades on brackets running below the roof cornice. In the inside, the original floor has been preserved in the narthex, made of marble tiles in various colors. Nearly half of the frescoes have been destroyed. Despot Stefan is portrayed with the church model on the left-hand wall. The lower register of the north choir depicts warrior-saints in armor with swords and lances, as an authentic representation of contemporaneous soldiers. The vault above the main door contains a picture of the Souls of the Righteous held by the Divine hand. On the left and right, the prophets David and Solomon are portrayed respectively. There are also 24 portraits of the Old Testament prophets and patriarchs in the spacious dome. Two compositions cover the <b>whole</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> registers in the altar: the first represents the Adoration of the Lamb, the other the Communion of Apostles.|$|E
40|$|Jean-Luc Nancy: {{from the}} modern {{subject to the}} body excess The {{dissolution}} of the Cartesian dichotomy between res cogitans and res extensa is the background where an entirely new horizon opened up {{in the context of}} the philosophical culture of the <b>whole</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> post-war periods, up to the latest ethical, scientific, religious and biotechnological debates. Within such horizon the crisis of modern subject rises in all its fullness. Jean-Luc Nancy’s thought offers a new modality to conceive the Cartesian subject. This means to abandon the basic “ego sum” power, to achieve the “ego cum”; the place where every being, every subject, every body is the result of the fortuitous relationship with other organic or inorganic, vital or not-vital bodies...|$|E

50|$|After {{the fall}} of Pristina and Prizren the Bulgarian High Command again turned its {{attention}} {{to the south and}} began transferring reinforcements for operations against the Entente forces that had grown to as much as 130,000 men. General Maurice Sarrail realized that the defeat of the Serbian Army made his positions untenable {{in the face of the}} <b>whole</b> Bulgarian <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>Second</b> armies <b>and</b> began to withdraw parts of his army. By December the Bulgarian Second Army undertook a major offensive against the retreating allies and after several engagements with the French and British 10th (Irish) Division at Kosturino reached the Greek border. At this point Vardar Macedonia was completely cleared of Entente presence but the Second Army several times received warnings from the Bulgarian High Command that any crossing of the Greek border was absolutely forbidden. This allow the Allies to safely retreat to Salonika.|$|R

In the third are comprehended all his speeches and pamphlets from his first arrival at Bristol, as a candidate, in the year 1774, to his farewell address from the hustings of that city, in the year 1780. What he himself published relative to the affairs of India occupies the fourth volume. The remaining four comprise his works since the French Revolution, {{with the exception of the}} Letter to Lord Kenmare on the Penal Laws against Irish Catholics, which was probably inserted where it stands from its relation to the subject of the Letter addressed by him, at a later period, to Sir Hercules Langrishe. With the same exception, too, strict regard has been paid to chronological order, which, in the last edition, was in some instances broken, to insert pieces that wore not discovered till it was too late to introduce them in their proper places.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} cluster members of 1876 open clusters, using positions and proper motions of the astrometric catalogue UCAC 4. For this purpose we apply three different methods, all them based on a Bayesian approach, but with different formulations: a purely parametric method, another completely non-parametric algorithm, and a third, recently developed by Sampedro & Alfaro, using both formulations at different steps of the <b>whole</b> process. The <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> statistical moments of the members phase-space subspace, obtained after applying the three methods, are compared for every cluster. Although, on average, the three methods yield similar results, specific differences between them, as well as for some particular clusters, are also present. The comparison with other published catalogues shows good agreement. We have also estimated {{for the first time the}} mean proper motion for a sample of 18 clusters. The results are organized in a single catalogue formed by two main files, one with the most relevant information for each cluster, partially including that in UCAC 4, and the other showing the individual membership probabilities for each star in the cluster area. The final catalogue, with an interface design that enables an easy interaction with the user, is available in electronic format at SSG-IAA ([URL] website.
