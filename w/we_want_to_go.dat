500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." [...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

2500|$|The Discovery Institute {{continues}} to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source {{of much of}} its funding. In an interview of Stephen C.

2500|$|In late December, Scott Hoying {{stated that}} for 2015, [...] "Pentatonix is {{transitioning}} towards original music."

5000|$|According to Attila, {{the band}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make an album that [...] "sounded like Mayhem." [...] He said that [...] "After the Ordo album, {{which was a}} little bit progressive—maybe a little bit too much—almost like a fusion album where riffs were not {{repeated}} and the rhythm was always out or different or kind of twisted, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back from there instead of going forward in that direction. Every Mayhem album has a kind of unique aspect, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> a little bit more traditional extreme metal. Of course, there’s all these elements that Mayhem has built up for itself as a band, but <b>we</b> still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> something that was straightforward musically and a little more brutal and more like extreme metal." ...|$|R

2500|$|Shimomura has a {{son with}} a {{learning}} disability who graduated from the University of the Arts London in 2013. Shimomura commented to the New York Times that his son {{would not have been}} able to enroll in a Japanese university, and said [...] "the British system is more open to a broader range of people and talents... I would like to see the system here be revamped so that avenues of opportunities will be open to all children. After all, considering where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> it is less important for us to create 10,000 people with run-of-the mill capabilities than a few with superb talents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording process {{started in}} May 2009 and {{took place in}} four {{different}} recording studios. Main recording was done at Scorpio Sound Studio in Hannover, Germany. Vocals were done in The Garage Studios in Stockholm, while additional vocals were recorded in Vocal Land Studio. Drum parts were recorded at Atlantisstudion in Stockholm. By the mid-December 2009, the band had finished with the recording of the album. Just before Christmas, they invited people from the European record company people to a listening session. After they listened to the whole album {{the next day the}} management told the band that the record company loved it and that it was the best record in years. The management proposed the idea of this album being the last studio album and announcing a final tour. Matthias Jabs explained [...] "We had never spent a second thinking about this. For us, subconsciously, we thought it would go on forever. We were taken back a bit, but after a couple days living with the thought we decided together – that would be the right thing to do. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on top while we are still healthy and can still do a high-energy show that’s two, sometimes three hours a night." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{we talked}} about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a {{steamboat}} now, and the money would last us as far as <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in the free States.
