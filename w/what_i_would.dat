25|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Do If I Were The Prime Minister. Maclean's, September 4, 2006.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that the {{combinations}} which present themselves to the mind {{in a kind of}} sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed {{as a result of the}} automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

6000|$|... "But I won't give up, and I {{never say}} 'Beat.' I'm {{not going to}} be laughed out of it, and I'll do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> if it takes all summer, Chris Warner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And mine {{still come}} too late," [...] he replied, sighing. [...] "O, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> not give to have resisted? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> not give for freedom?" ...|$|R
500|$|In Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, Thersites compares Menelaus, {{brother of}} Agamemnon, to a louse: [...] "Ask me not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be, if I were not Thersites; for I {{care not to}} be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Arning, {{director}} of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, called his portraits [...] "thickly painted in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call 'high-amateur' mode" [...] and wrote, [...] "I would say {{they need to be}} less based on photographic reproduction. You can tell when someone is taking a found photograph and making a painting out of it [...] I think he'd be well advised to work from other, multiple photographic sources or the real person {{to get a little bit}} more liveliness going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Opting {{to shoot}} using Mitchell cameras {{incorporating}} 35mm Eastman Kodak film and anamorphic lenses, Warren recalls that the produced footage boasted [...] "an incredibly sharp image and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> term as the 'American' look." [...] He remembers that {{the setting of}} the Chislehurst Caves rendered the subterranean complex more realistic than a potential in-studio alternative given the modest budget of Inseminoid. However, the cold, damp, airless conditions, combined with the uneven surface of the cave floors, complicated the filming sessions and necessitated frequent repairs of equipment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly remember. <b>I</b> {{told her}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>would</b> please her. I've been in Florence a week. <b>I</b> hoped you <b>would</b> {{come to see}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} nearly doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think <b>would</b> {{have been an}} unwise thing," [...] he said. [...] "It was {{fortunate}} you came along when you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{he said it}} {{is hardly}} {{for me to tell}} you. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> said,--I <b>would</b> you could know it all without my repeating a word of it." ...|$|R
500|$|Ryan {{announced}} in February {{that she was}} working with industry veterans like Quincy Jones on a new EP featuring her own work, which she called more [...] "mainstream" [...] than anything she had written before. She started her own record label, Bianca Ryan Records LLC, to promote her artistic freedom as well as make a profit. [...] "I could literally sell 1% of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sell with a record company and finally make money off my music to where I can fund other projects".|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Phil Symes of Disc and Music Echo in May 1971, Ronnie Spector {{admitted}} that she had hated being away from the music industry. The situation had been forced on her by her husband's semi-retirement in 1966, following the failure in America of Ike & Tina Turner's single [...] "River Deep – Mountain High", a production that Phil Spector had considered his masterpiece. Ronnie Spector told Symes: [...] "For four years Phil and I completely detached ourselves from everyone {{in the business and}} settled down in California. I was so bored and missed the stage so much I nearly had a nervous breakdown. If I hadn't had a kid I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not write}} {{this as a}} lawyer seeking an {{advantage}} for a client; but only as a friend, only urging you to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do if <b>I</b> were in your situation. I mean this as private and confidential only, but I feel {{a good deal of}} anxiety about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what she really does care for," [...] said Babie, [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>would</b> waken up her soul much better than marrying poor Allen," ...|$|R
60|$|I agreed most heartily {{with these}} sentiments, {{although}} I did not deem {{it necessary to}} say so, and Ruth now asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> supposed <b>would</b> become of us.|$|R
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would have done better. But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Dinklage has {{a form of}} dwarfism, achondroplasia, {{which affects}} bone growth. As a result, he is [...] tall, with a typical-sized head and torso but short limbs. While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha {{to have a sense of}} humor", to know [...] "that it's not your problem. It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say. Everyone's different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Penniman stared a little, and smiled. [...] "Why, I have {{explained}} to you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think <b>would</b> happen--that {{in the end}} it would be the best thing to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please God," [...] {{returned}} William deliberately, [...] "I {{could buy}} groceries, and bits o' tapes, and thread, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>would</b> sell, and <b>I</b> could begin hawking at first." ...|$|R
60|$|B.--Nothing, sir, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{suppose you}} <b>would</b> have me {{understand}} by it.|$|R
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I had no idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three {{nights in a row}} because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>what</b> dreams <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have that}} night; {{but as it}} turned out I did not sleep at all. At breakfast I informed Mr. Burns that I had resigned my command.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{was fully}} {{recovered}} he began again. 'My dear,' says he, 'what made you so surprised at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have you consider seriously of it? You may see plainly how the family stand in this case, {{and they would}} be stark mad if it was my case, as it is my brother's; and for aught <b>I</b> see, it <b>would</b> be my ruin and yours too.' ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{been in the}} house, I {{could well}} believe him, but if he knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, he <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> think have raised his terms.|$|R
500|$|Drake's {{physical}} attractiveness {{has been}} {{another area of}} commentary, {{with at least one}} reviewer declaring a man crush for him. Drake has been described as [...] "dreamy", and a [...] "handsome, charismatic hero." [...] Claudia Black, voice of Chloe Frazer from , admitted having a crush on Drake as well. Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude". In 2014, La Nueva España included him the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders.|$|E
500|$|Joyce's {{versions}} of events recorded in his published diaries {{have been described}} as unreliable and sometimes as outright invention—a [...] "self-aggrandizing epic". [...] Specific examples of this [...] "fabulism" [...] include his self-designation as [...] "Captain" [...] after the Ross Sea expedition; [...] his invented claim to have seen Scott's death tent on the Barrier; [...] the misrepresentation of his instructions from Shackleton regarding his sledging role, and his assertion of independence in the field; his claim to have been offered a place on the transcontinental party when Shackleton had made it clear he did not want him there; [...] and his habit, late in life, of writing anonymously to the press praising [...] "the famous Polar Explorer Ernest Mills Joyce". This self-promotion neither surprised nor upset his former comrades. [...] "It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have expected", said Richards. [...] "He was bombastic [...] but true-hearted and a staunch friend". Alexander Stevens, the party's chief scientist, concurred. They knew that Joyce, for all his swaggering style, had the will and determination to [...] "drag men back from certain death". Lord Shackleton, the explorer's son, named Joyce (with Mackintosh and Richards) as [...] "one of those who emerge from the (Ross Sea party) story as heroes".|$|E
500|$|... "Booze Cruise" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A". Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad stated [...] "This sitcom gets better every week" [...] and that [...] "What made this one quite good {{was that they}} didn't rely on Dwight too much, although the bits with him 'driving' the boat were good." [...] Monique Marcil of Zap2it said that the [...] "28 seconds of silence between co-workers Jim and Pam capture all the awkwardness and longing of unspoken love better than any words could. And it's these private moments caught on film by the unseen documentary crew that give this otherwise tart sitcom its sweetness." [...] John Krasinski stated that [...] "Booze Cruise" [...] included two of his favorite scenes to film: Jim's conversation with Pam, and Jim's conversation with Michael. He later called both of the shots [...] "beautiful" [...] and noted that it was [...] "nothing short of an honor" [...] to film them with Fischer and Carell, respectively. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the episodes quotes; Steve Marsi rated Jim's quote, [...] "You know <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> save the receptionist. Just wanted to clear that up" [...] a 3 out of 5. Marsi also rated Jim and Michael's conversation about Pam a 5 out of 5.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{believe that}} Guy has gamed {{quite as much}} as I have myself; but I {{want to see him}} cleared beyond the power of Philip to gainsay or disbelieve it. I should like to have such a force of proof as would annihilate Philip, and if I was {{anything}} but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have it. If you could but lend me a leg for two days, Charlotte.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{that which}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> learn," [...] Pierre replied. [...] "It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe it <b>would</b> be better {{for us to see}} than if we wandered through the British encampment at York Town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rascals {{are well}} within range," [...] {{the captain said}} quietly. [...] "See, they are taking off canvas again. They intend to keep at that distance, and hammer away at us. Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>would</b> be their tactics." ...|$|R
