5|$|After their year {{of active}} service, Western Han-era {{soldiers}} were demobilized and sent home, {{where they were}} obligated to join the local militia that convened every eighth month of the year. This obligation was intended to curb local and regional warlordism that nonetheless became prevalent {{by the end of}} Han. Militias dismissed members <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the age of fifty-six. By Eastern Han, the obligation upon retired soldiers to join local militias was removed.|$|E

5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> Eldamar {{later than}} the Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} workers (<b>who</b> <b>reached</b> {{a peak of}} 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite.

5|$|After the attack, several sailors {{received}} medals {{for their}} conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Australia's streak {{looked in}} danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 in reply to India's 171 when Gilchrist {{came to the}} crease. He counterattacked savagely, scoring 122 in just 112 balls, and {{featuring}} in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs. This swung the momentum back to Australia, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> 349. Gilchrist took six catches and was named Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory, extending the world record run to 16.|$|E

5|$|During the preparations, a mixed {{unit that}} {{included}} local women protected the left {{flank of the}} Greek Army, against a possible attack by Ottoman groups that were stationed in Paramythia. Moreover, groups consisting of local females supported the Greek side in several ways, particularly in the transportation of guns, food, clothes, and other important supplies. On specific occasions women also participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces, {{some of them were}} distinguished in the battlefield, like Maria Nastouli, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> Los Alamos on 13 December 1943.

Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, it was {{announced}} that Black Country Communion would be reuniting in 2017 to record a fourth album.

Hughes and Bonamassa started writing new music for the forthcoming album in September, with recording beginning the following January. The album, entitled BCCIV, was released on September 22, 2017, and will be promoted at two UK shows in January 2018.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20km/h. Cornet, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{estimated}} 30,000 to 40,000 people <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> Dawson City during the gold rush, only around 15,000 to 20,000 finally became prospectors. Of these, {{no more than}} 4,000 struck gold {{and only a few}} hundred became rich. By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before. The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.|$|E
5|$|Scotland have {{qualified}} for the FIFA World Cup on eight occasions and the UEFA European Championship twice, but have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament. The team have achieved some noteworthy results, such as beating the 1966 FIFA World Cup winners England 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in 1967. Archie Gemmill scored what {{has been described as}} one of the greatest World Cup goals ever in a 3–2 win during the 1978 World Cup against the Netherlands, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the final of the tournament. In their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2008, Scotland defeated 2006 World Cup runners-up France 1–0 in both fixtures.|$|E

5|$|The Cayman Islands sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The delegation included fifteen people; of the delegation, four athletes participated under the Caymanian flag. In the track and field events was Ronald Forbes, who also served as the Cayman Islands' flag-bearer during the Opening Ceremony and reached quarterfinals in the 110m hurdles, and Cydonie Mothersille, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> finals and ranked eighth in the 200m dash. Brothers Shaune and Brett Fraser, both swimmers, participated in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in the 200m backstroke, respectively. The Cayman Islands' appearance at the Beijing Olympics marked its ninth appearance since its debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The Cayman Islands, {{up to and including}} Beijing, have yet to medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Nolan {{was part}} of the team <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the FA Cup quarter-final, before being defeated by Arsenal at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton also progressed in the league, with a 1–1 draw with Portsmouth in the final game of the season, and Nolan's four league goals helping to secure UEFA Cup qualification {{for the first time in}} their history. The club reached the last 32 of the UEFA Cup the following season, with Nolan's goal in the first round defeat of Lokomotiv Plovdiv helping the club reach the group stages. He scored the winner as the club overcame Zenit St. Petersburg 1–0 in the group stages, and a further nine in the league to help Bolton finish eighth, missing out on European qualification.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{were drawn}} against Dukla Prague of Czechoslovakia in the quarter-finals. The first leg {{finished}} 1–1 in the Netherlands, but Ajax lost the second leg 2–1 at the Stadion Juliska in Prague. Thus, {{they lost the}} tie 3–2 on aggregate. Following the match, Michels decided to reshape his team. He moved defender Ton Pronk into midfield and sold his captain Frits Soetekouw, who had scored an own goal in the second leg, to rivals PSV Eindhoven, signing Velibor Vasović from Partizan Belgrade as his replacement. The changes had the desired effect as Ajax won the Eredivisie four times between 1966 and 1970. They also reached {{the final of the}} 1968–69 European Cup, but lost 4–1 to Italian team Milan. The team's style, known as Total Football, would come to fruition in the 1970s as Ajax won three consecutive European Cups from 1971 to 1973. Total Football was also implemented by the Netherlands national football team, <b>who</b> <b>reached</b> the final of the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 1978, losing on both occasions.|$|E
