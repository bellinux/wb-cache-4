5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
5|$|The main {{dramatic}} {{thrust of}} the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth, although the crew's ownership of an unlimited time-space travel drive in series seven was to partly negate this intention. As their journey begins, the not-so-intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions, faster-than-light travel, mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years. During the second series, the group encounter the service mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appeared in one episode of series two, but {{by the beginning of}} series three he had become a regular character. At the end of series five, Red Dwarf itself is stolen by persons unknown, forcing the crew to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two series, with the side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew encounters a parallel version of themselves from a universe in which Kristine Kochanski, Lister's long-term love interest, had been put into stasis {{at the time of the}} leak and so became the last remaining human. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in the series' main universe, where she is forced to join the crew. At the end of series seven, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Kryten's service nanobots, which had abandoned him years earlier, were behind the theft of the Red Dwarf at the end of series five.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} incorporation of the Lambda loop transformation Toolkit into the ParaScope parallel programming environment. The goal was to extend the functionality of ParaScope, to determine {{the usefulness of the}} Lambda Toolkit in environments other than that of its original development, and to evaluate the quality of code generation before and after incorporation of Lambda-based analysis and transformation. <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> ParaScope could be extended, but only by very brave people; <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the Lambda Toolkit could be used by other programming systems to good effect; we also compared two different proposed interfaces for the Lambda Toolkit...|$|R
60|$|Later {{in the day}} <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> it was Colonel Willett's {{intention}} to push on to German Flats, and there, procuring horses, ride at full speed down the valley to General Schuyler's headquarters.|$|R
30|$|With the {{information}} collected, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the health tourism concept in Thailand is very vague. Most {{people do not}} know the right meaning of spa. Medical tourism and health tourism are interchangeably used in many occasions.|$|R
5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E
25|$|At lines 2813-2815 <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> the thane Wiglaf is a Waegmunding; {{therefore}} {{his father}} Weohstan {{was in some}} way related to Ecgþeow.|$|E
25|$|At lines 2428-2429 <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} Bēowulf was fostered {{and raised in}} the home of Hreðel {{starting}} when he was seven years old; Ecgþēow may have died by then, or the family may just have been following a custom.|$|E
60|$|From {{inquiries}} that Michelot {{had made}} on the road, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> no troop such as that which rode with St. Auban had lately passed that way, so that 't was clear we were in front of them.|$|R
40|$|In {{these remarks}} I discuss a {{proposal}} to legislate a rule for mone-tary policy. The proposal modernizes laws first passed in the late 1970 s, but largely discarded in 2000. A {{number of years ago}} I proposed a simple rule as a guideline for monetary policy. 1 I made no suggestion then that the rule should be written into law, or even that it be used to monitor policy, or hold central banks accountable. The objective was to help central bankers make their interest rate decisions in a less discretionary and more rule-like manner, and thereby achieve the goal of price stability and economic stability. The rule incorporated what <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> from research on optimal design of monetary rules in the years before. In the years since then <b>we</b> have <b>learned</b> much more. <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> such simple rules are robust to widely different views about how monetary policy works (see Taylor and Williams 2011). <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> such rules are frequently used by financial market analysts in their assessment of policy and by policymakers in their own deliber-ations (see Asso, Kahn, and Leeson 2007). <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> when pol-icy is close to such rules, economic performance is good: inflation is low, expansions are long, unemployment is low, and recessions ar...|$|R
5000|$|In the Bahir it {{is written}} [...] "And who are the Officers? <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> there are three. Strength (Gevurah) Is the Officer of all the Holy Forms {{to the left of}} the Blessed Holy One. He is Gabriel." ...|$|R
25|$|Susan's {{character}} was phased out {{early in this}} season. Larry began dating Jennifer Lyons (Melanie Wilson) and Balki began dating Mary Anne Spencer (Rebeca Arthur), after meeting them through a local gym. In later episodes, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> both women are flight attendants who live in Larry and Balki's building.|$|E
25|$|From Jayaratha, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Abhinavagupta was in {{possession}} of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of śaktipāta, {{as described in the}} sacred texts (Śrīpūrvaśāstra): an unflinching faith in God, realisation of mantras, control over objective principles (referring to the 36 tattvas), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the metropolis, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Mike, having married Phyllis on the {{assumption}} that his job as estate manager for Psmith's father would be secure, found on Mr Smith's death that the old man was bankrupt, and is working as a poorly paid schoolmaster. Psmith worked for a time for an uncle in the fish business, but could stand the fish no longer and quit.|$|E
30|$|During the {{interviews}} <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> logistics service providers {{also play a}} key role in OC distribution. Therefore, we expanded the scope and invited the top 10 service providers in retail logistics (Hübner et al. 2013 b), of which five participated.|$|R
30|$|After we had {{completed}} Blau et al. (2011), <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Fernández and Fogli (2005), the NBER Working Paper version of Fernández and Fogli (2009), employs such a falsification test, which was apparently {{cut from the}} published version of the paper.|$|R

25|$|The Prometheus Bound {{appears to}} have been the first play in a trilogy called the Prometheia. In the second play, Prometheus Unbound, Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually {{regenerating}} liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned {{at the conclusion of the}} Titanomachy.|$|E
25|$|From there Louis {{begins to}} recall his own {{youthful}} memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., {{was a famous}} actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> his mother died by suicide {{a few months after}} his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day.|$|E
60|$|Certain it is, however, {{that the}} {{afternoon}} was well spent before {{we saw him}} coming up the road, and our surprise can well be imagined when <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> he had with him as companion none other than Horry Sims.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Bedford was not {{so famous}} for hops as formerly, since the price is fluctuating, and poles are now scarce. Yet if the {{traveller}} goes back {{a few miles from}} the river, the hop-kilns will still excite his curiosity.|$|R
40|$|Real Business Cycle Theory: What Have <b>We</b> <b>Learned?</b> Real business-cvcle {{theory is}} the {{application}} of general equilibrium theory to the quantitatiy analysis of businnes-cycle fluctuation. The theory is real {{in the sense that}} there really is something there. In this review article I document that in applying established theory to quantitatively address business-cycle questions, a lot has been <b>learned.</b> <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> business cycles are nor deviations from this established theory. but rather are just what this theory predicts. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> business cycles are induced by hight persistent changes in those factors that determine the steady-state level of the deterministic growth model. Non persistent shocks do not induce fluctuations of the business-cycle variety. In this article I also discuss some methodological issues concerning judging and testing business cycle models...|$|R
25|$|Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime — This is {{the tale}} in which <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Nero has been married, {{has adopted a}} {{daughter}} in his native Montenegro, {{and has become a}} U.S. citizen in order to enjoy peace and democracy. The plot hinges on international and domestic secrets but it is sober and sound. Archie, Cramer, {{and the rest of the}} cast are in top form, and Nero is noticeably more outspoken and impulsive than he subsequently became.|$|E
25|$|The curators use many {{clues to}} {{assemble}} an accurate interior. Wills and inventories of possessions of families {{of a similar}} economic level inform us about what might {{be found in a}} similar household. Period paintings help answer questions concerning the disposition of furniture about the room, possible color schemes, and the sort of textiles that might have been used. Through paintings, for example, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> mid-Eastern carpets were too valuable to place on the floor but rather were displayed on tabletops and then in turn covered with white linen cloths during meals.|$|E
25|$|Charlie Brown returns, and, {{with his}} friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages {{to make some}} progress. Charlie Brown {{steps up to the}} plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. <b>We</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> this was a flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal ("T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)"). Lucy takes a crabbiness survey and Linus says that her crabbiness rating is ninety-five. After {{punching}} him, she realizes that she, in reality, is really very crabby.|$|E

25|$|The main {{character}} is Sam Vimes, a haggard, cynical, working-class street copper who, {{when we first}} meet him in Guards! Guards!, is the drunken/alcoholic Captain of the 2-person Night Watch: lazy, cowardly, and none-too-bright Sergeant Fred Colon, and Corporal Nobby Nobbs, a petty thief in his own right. Then Carrot Ironfoundersson, a 6-foot-6-inch-tall (1.98 m) dwarf-by-adoption, comes down from the mountains to join the Watch and do real policing. The Night Watch manages to save the city from a dragon, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Carrot is possibly the rightful {{heir to the throne}} of Ankh-Morpork, and the Patrician decides to allow Vimes to create a real police force.|$|E
25|$|That same day, Ipomadon is {{told that}} his mother is dying; he returns to Apulia and learns from her on her deathbed {{that he has a}} {{half-brother}}. Much later in the tale <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> the name of this half-brother is Cabanus and there is a grand recognition scene between Ipomadon and his brother {{at the very end of}} the story. Cabanus is living at King Meleager's court in Sicily, who, you will remember, is the Proud's uncle, and, following his abrupt departure from this proud teenager's queenly court and a season of jousting in far-flung corners of Christendom, Ipomadon arrives in Sicily and to King Maleager's court, becoming known at once as the queen's favourite, perhaps even her lover. But he again becomes a figure of fun among the other noblemen for his (feigned) dislike of jousting in favour of hunting.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Prometheus Bound was the first play in a trilogy conventionally called the Prometheia, but the other two plays, Prometheus Unbound and Prometheus the Fire-Bringer, survive only in fragments. In Prometheus Unbound, Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat the Titan's perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned {{at the conclusion of}} the Titanomachy. In Prometheus the Fire-Bringer, the Titan finally warns Zeus not to lie with the sea nymph Thetis, for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus would later marry Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union will be Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. Grateful for the warning, Zeus finally reconciles with Prometheus.|$|E
60|$|Of a verity I {{believe a}} full fifteen minutes elapsed before all our {{people were in}} line of battle, which spoke badly for what might happen in case the enemy planned a surprise, and then <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the alarm was a false one.|$|R
40|$|When I was an {{undergraduate}} in Oxford, {{we were taught}} economics almost {{as though it were}} a natural science. The subject matter of economics might be different from physics, but only in the way that the subject matter of chemistry or biology is different from physics. The actual results were presented to us as if they were scientific theories. So, when <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> savings equals investment, it was taught in the same tone of voice as one teaches that force equals mass times acceleration. And <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> rational entrepreneurs sell where marginal cost equals marginal revenue in the way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> once <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> bodies attract in a way that is directly proportional to the product of their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. At no point was it ever suggested that the reality described by economic theory was dependent on human beliefs and other attitudes in a way that was totally unlike the reality described by physics or chemistry. ...|$|R
60|$|At the {{consulate}} <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Captain Trent had alighted (such is, I believe, the classic phrase) at the What Cheer House.
