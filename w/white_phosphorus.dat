5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} of July 7, North Korean {{pressure}} developed from the west edge of town. Around 2000 a column of North Korean tanks and infantry approached the town from the east. The column was hit by shells from the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, which was supporting the 34th Infantry with 105mm Howitzers firing <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> and High Explosive Anti Tank shells. The 63rd Field Artillery Battalion was able to destroy two of the tanks, but by midnight the column had infiltrated Chonan. The 63rd Field Artillery continued to fire <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> throughout the night, illuminating the terrain for the U.S. forces and preventing them from being overrun. After midnight, the North Korean force was able to cut off 80 men, including Martin, {{from the rest of}} the U.S. force, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Wadlington, the regimental executive officer, took command and contacted Dean requesting additional ammunition. By 0220 on July 8 Martin had returned to the town and the supply road to Taejon was reopened.|$|E
5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E

5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in his mind as a dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> strike.

50|$|Phosphorus {{deficiency}} {{can produce}} symptoms {{similar to those}} of nitrogen deficiency, but as noted by Russel: “Phosphate deficiency differs from nitrogen deficiency in being extremely difficult to diagnose, and crops can be suffering from extreme starvation without there being any obvious signs that lack of phosphate is the cause”. Russell’s observation applies to at least some coniferous seedlings, but Benzian found that although response to phosphorus in very acid forest tree nurseries in England was consistently high, no species (including Sitka spruce) showed any visible symptom of deficiency other than a slight lack of lustre. Phosphorus levels have to be exceedingly low before visible symptoms appear in such seedlings. In sand culture at 0 ppm <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>white</b> spruce seedlings were very small and tinted deep purple; at 0.62 ppm, only the smallest seedlings were deep purple; at 6.2 ppm, the seedlings were of good size and color.|$|R
5|$|For the American forces, abuses were {{typically}} either a disproportionate use of firepower or servicemen committing extrajudicial killings (such as in Haditha).

5|$|Otway {{launched}} the assault {{as soon as}} the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions, and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties; only four attackers survived to reach Casemate Four, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> grenades, as the crews had neglected to lock the doors leading into the battery. During the bombing raid, the battery's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation. During the battle, 22 Germans were killed and a similar number made prisoners of war. The rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers.|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements preserved in earth, constructing with a fraction of ~ 0. 1 % of the earth crust. In general, phosphorus has several allotropes. The two most commonly seen allotropes, <b>white</b> and red <b>phosphorus,</b> are widely used in explosives and safety matches. In addition, black phosphorus, though rarely mentioned, is a layered semiconductor and have great potentials in optical and electronic applications. Remarkably, this layered material can be reduced to one single atomic layer in the vertical direction owing to the van der Waals structure, known as phosphorene, where the physical properties can be tremendously different from its bulk counterpart. In this review article, we trace back to the 100 years research history on black phosphorus from the synthesis to material properties, and extend the topic from black phosphorus to phosphorene. The physical and transport properties are highlighted, aiming at further applications in electronic and optoelectronics devices.

40|$|AbstractThe use {{of white}} LEDs in {{photovoltaic}} standalone lighting systems requires knowledge of electrical, optical and thermal characteristics. These parameters {{allow us to}} improve and develop this type of system. Luminous intensity and life time of LEDs components are functions of the current intensity. To have stable LEDs characteristics various configurations are proposed for the Driver circuit (Direct Current “DC” mode, Pulse Width Modulation “PWM” mode). Various selection criteria are discussed such as: {{the simplicity of the}} circuit, the cost of manufacturing, energy consumption and losses (thermal and electrical) generated by this specific LED's Driver. This study allowed us to implement a command control (DC Driver) to solar LEDs lamp based on <b>white</b> diodes of <b>phosphorus</b> GaN semiconductors. This system is applied to street lighting by means of photovoltaic standalone system.

40|$|The total {{phosphorus}} in eight different andosoil profiles of Canary Islands, was determined using seven methods. SDome are specific such as; the attack by a mixture HF/HNO 2 (Ximenez Herrais, 1975) in a pressure reactor, and digestion with HCIO 4 (Jackson, 1964); and others non specific for {{total phosphorus}}, but nevertheless {{used for the}} study of phosphorus in soils; such as, the methods of Mehta (1954), Harrap (1963), Steward-Oades (1972), Saunders-Williams (1955) and Krivonosova (1972). The results obtained by the attack HF/HNO 2 give the highest values of all the methods used, white the HCIO 4 digestion largely used to determine total P in soils, gives even lower values than those obtained by the methods of Mehta and Krivonosova, used respectively for organic phosphorus and organic phosphate fractions. The procedures of Mehta and Krivonosova give acceptable values in the determination of total phosphorus in Canary Andosoils, white the other methods give values which are too low. Study of the regression lines of the total phosphorus values obtained by the various methods as against the attack by HF/HNO 3 shown in Graph nº 1, give us an overall idea of the effectiveness, trends, similarities and differences between all methods. It can also be that all methods should be good if the soils contain up to 1. 000 ppm of total <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>white</b> for higher values great differences are shown by the various methods.

25|$|Most {{production}} of phosphorus-bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers. For this purpose, phosphate minerals are converted to phosphoric acid. It follows two distinct chemical routes, the main one being treatment of phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid. The other process utilises <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> {{which may be}} produced by reaction and distillation from very low grade phosphate sources. The <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with base to give phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid produced from <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> is relatively pure and is the main route for the {{production of}} phosphates for all purposes, including detergent production.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus {{can reduce}} {{elemental}} iodine to hydroiodic acid, {{which is a}} reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. For this reason, red and <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> were designated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as List I precursor chemicals under 21 CFR 1310.02 effective on November 17, 2001. In the United States, handlers of red or <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> are subject to stringent regulatory controls.|$|E

25|$|If it {{is heated}} in an {{atmosphere}} of inert gas, for example nitrogen or carbon dioxide, it sublimes and the vapour condenses as <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus.</b> If it is heated in a vacuum and the vapour condensed rapidly, violet phosphorus is obtained. It would appear that violet phosphorus is a polymer of high relative molecular mass, which on heating breaks down into P2 molecules.

25|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the RAF how their <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus</b> as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was <b>white</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers– this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.|$|E
