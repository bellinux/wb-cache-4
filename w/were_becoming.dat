5|$|By the 1920s, the kakapo was {{extinct in}} the North Island and its range and {{numbers in the}} South Island were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and {{occasionally}} eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> scarce.|$|E
5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun. Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps.|$|E
5|$|In Israel, a {{first use}} for pest control was in 1983 at the Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, where {{pesticides}} <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> a health hazard to local residents. A local farmer sought after an alternative which {{he found in}} installing nest boxes.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care. At the same time, elements of the division, including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea, <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly hard to keep in place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|Although Herrerasaurus {{shared the}} body {{shape of the}} large {{carnivorous}} dinosaurs, it lived {{during a time when}} dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% {{of the total number of}} fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.|$|E

5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> inbred, meaning fertile {{eggs were}} scarcer and the ducks were more {{susceptible}} to disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E

In this paper, we present and evaluate the novel idea of shadow configurations. Shadow configurations allow configuration evaluation before deployment and thus can reduce potential network disruptions. We demonstrate using real implementation that shadow configurations can be implemented with low overhead...|$|R
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> apparent {{concerning the}} settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for {{breaking}} up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{was nervous}} about the film's {{reception}} because silent films <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights became one of Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres. Players {{turned away from}} RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. Later RPGs would draw influences from action genres, but would face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling and character interactions.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E

Similarly government debt was increasing, although it was still expected the railway line to Abbotsford Bridge would be completed. In November, construction started and it was expected that the bridge would be opened around 25 September the following year.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area.

Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E
