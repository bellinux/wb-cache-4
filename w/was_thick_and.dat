5|$|On 14 April 1471, {{at around}} 4o'clock in the morning, both armies woke. Edward had planned {{for an early}} attack, however, and quickly roused his men to engage the Lancastrians. Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms. The morning fog <b>was</b> <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> the night {{movements}} of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other. Neither group was facing the other; each was offset slightly to the right. This displacement meant that the right end of either army could outflank the other by wrapping around the opposing left end. The Lancastrians {{were the first to}} exploit this advantage; Oxford's group quickly overwhelmed Hastings'. Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet, chased by the Lancastrians. Some of Hastings' men even reached London, spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory. Oxford's group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet. Yelling and chasing after his men, Oxford rallied 800 of them and led them back to the battle.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} the Franks, hearing that both the Goths and Romans had {{suffered}} severely by the war... forgetting for the moment their oaths and treaties... (for this nation in matters of trust is the most treacherous in the world), they straightway gathered {{to the number of}} one hundred thousand under the leadership of Theudebert I and marched into Italy: they had a small body of cavalry about their leader, and these were the only ones armed with spears, while all the rest were foot soldiers having neither bows nor spears, but each man carried a sword and shield and one axe. Now the iron head of this weapon <b>was</b> <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> exceedingly sharp on both sides, while the wooden handle was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these axes at a signal in the first charge and thus to shatter the shields of the enemy and kill the men.|$|E
500|$|Cú Chulainn's {{appearance}} is occasionally remarked {{on in the}} texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless. He {{is often described as}} dark: in The Wooing of Emer and Bricriu's Feast he is [...] "a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men of Erin", in The Intoxication of the Ulstermen he is a [...] "little, black-browed man", and in The Phantom Chariot of Cú Chulainn [...] "is hair <b>was</b> <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> black, and smooth as though a cow had licked it... in his head his eyes gleamed swift and grey"; yet the prophetess Fedelm in the Táin Bó Cúailnge describes him as blond.

2500|$|On 1 October {{a patrol}} of six {{squadron}} planes saw enemy biplanes {{in the vicinity}} of Bantheville, [...] however only Lt. Cone was able to shoot one down in the region of Brieulles. [...] The squadron daily engaged in combats while escorting bomber and observation planes. [...] Because of bad weather, very few patrols were made between 10–18 October, the clouds hung very low, the mist <b>was</b> <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> at times {{there was a great deal}} of drizzly rain. [...] However, on the 18th the squadron was able to fly a protection mission for the 1st Day Bombardment Group.|$|E
2500|$|At daybreak on 8 February 1944, planes {{from the}} escort {{carriers}} were covering the convoy. At 13:00, the convoy changed course {{and started the}} last leg of the route toward the British Isles. At 19:30, fog set in and all ships were out of sight of LST-21 which turned on navigation lights and sounded whistle to avoid collision. At 8:45, the fog lifted and at 24:00 the convoy executed an emergency turn to starboard. On 9 February, at 00:35, the convoy resumed it course. At 01:13, they received a radio message that a submarine, , was sunk off the port side of the convoy. At 08:11, the convoy executed an emergency turn of 45 degrees to port, and at 08:40 resumed course. At 10:10, an escort on the starboard bow indicated a contact. LST-21s radioman tuned into an extra receiver on the escorts' and the planes' frequency and the officers and crew in LST-21s wheelhouse listened in on their communications. At approximately 11:00, a plane reported a sub on the surface bearing 150 degrees. The pilot kept repeating this to the Escort Commander, until the reply came back: [...] "Stop telling us about it and get the 'bowstud.'" [...] A few minutes later, the plane reported back: [...] "One down. One down." [...] At 12:14, all ships received a message from the convoy commander confirming the sinking of the second submarine. The weather <b>was</b> <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> visibility only about a mile and a half. At 16:45, they received another message from the Commodore confirming the sinking of a third submarine. The escorts and planes were noted to be having a difficult time with communications due to all of the contacts, real or imagined.|$|E
