500|$|On September 22, 2011, an 18-year-old Melanie Amaro {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on {{the second}} day of the opening week of first season of The X Factor in the US. As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing. You have the gift, you have the soul, you have the spirit, you have the swagger ... you have the X Factor" [...] while Simon Cowell said: [...] "When I was asked by a lot of people why I was bringing this show to America, it was because I hoped that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> someone like you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. never {{adopted the}} {{floating}} charge directly {{because at the}} time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a fraudulent conveyance. [...] However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property. [...] As it had become clear that creditors and debtors <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> ways to create enforceable de facto security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly Grant Gilmore) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien.|$|E

60|$|With all {{due respect}} to, and {{appreciation}} of, the breaks of the Siwash, we unanimously decided that if cougars inhabited any other section of canyon country, we preferred it, and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it. We had often speculated on {{the appearance of the}} rim wall directly across the neck of the canyon upon which we were located. It showed a long stretch of breaks, fissures, caves, yellow crags, crumbled ruins and clefts green with pinyon pine. As a crow flies, it was only a mile or two straight across from camp, but to reach it, we had to ascend the mountain and head the canyon which deeply indented the slope.|$|E

Hence the term Binnalonan, which in Ilocano and Pangasinan means [...] "a place where people bring and eat their baon", was born. At present, the town is called Binalonan while its people are known as Binalonians.|$|E

[...] "With the escalation of building costs, would we be able to sustain that grant program? We were locked into what we had as a private foundation.

The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.|$|E

[...] Bud has three children, Lori, Geoffrey and Sydney. He has three brothers - Jim (deceased), Ralph and Fred. Bud is now retired from his careers in real estate and teaching high school algebra and special education. Ogden also coached his high school's basketball team.

5000|$|Fairbairn revised much of Freud's {{model of}} the mind. He {{identified}} how people who were abused as children internalize that experience. Fairbairn's [...] "moral defense" [...] is the tendency seen in survivors of abuse {{to take all the}} bad upon themselves, each believing he is morally bad so his caretaker object can be regarded as good. This is a use of splitting as a defense to maintain an attachment relationship in an unsafe world. Fairbairn introduced a four-year-old girl with a broken arm to a doctor friend of his. He told the little girl that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> her a new mommy. [...] "Oh no!" [...] the girl cried. [...] "I want my real mommy." [...] "You mean the mommy that broke your arm?" [...] Fairbairn asked. [...] "I was bad," [...] the girl replied. She needed to believe that her love object (mother) was all good, so that she could believe she would one day receive the love and nurturing she needed. If she accepted her mother was bad, then she would be bereft and alone in the world, an intolerable state. She used the Moral Defense to make herself bad, but preserve her mother's goodness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Brett Simon, and is both a prequel and a sequel to the video for [...] "The Reason". The video starts almost immediately {{after the end of}} [...] "The Reason", with the band fleeing the police because of the heist seen in the previous video, with everybody arrested except for lead singer Doug Robb and guitarist Dan Estrin. The video alternates between the past and present. The owner of the robbed pawn shop from the previous video is revealed to be a cop who has been following the band, and seems to be interrogating Robb. Numerous flashbacks show auditions for the band's lead singer (including cameos by Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Kanye West, and Joel Madden of Good Charlotte), until Robb impresses the band. The band manages to then evade police numerous times. In a plot twist, it is revealed that Robb was actually an undercover cop, with full knowledge that the band was planning the heist, that his [...] "interrogation" [...] was actually him being assigned to join the band, and that he knew when the police <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their hideout. At the video's end, Robb apprehends Estrin, who realizes that he set them up, during their supposed escape, and then shows the rest of the band also in custody.|$|E
40|$|Gaylord Opryland Hotel, a huge {{convention}} property {{with more}} than 2, 880 sleeping rooms. The hotel was full and each of its more upscale restaurants was booked. Several close friends attending the conference and I were looking forward to dinner together that evening. We had not visited in some time and had much to discuss. Good conversation and good food were our priorities. We {{wanted to stay in}} the hotel to eat if possible because the weather outside was nasty. One less formal hotel restaurant, Cascades, was available. That would be fine. We looked forward to being together, swapping stories, and having some good laughs. Except it wasn’t fine. A band was playing and the music was too loud for us to carry on a conversation. The Cascades Assistant General Manager, Lindsay Ketchum, twice moved us to a table farther from the music. However, the music still was disruptive and we told her that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> another restaurant outside the hotel. Lindsay volunteered to make the arrangements. After asking us our food preferences, she recommended a restaurant downtown, called the restaurant to get us a reservation, arranged a taxi for us, and then personally escorted us to the waiting taxi. She also insisted on comping the drinks already served. We all thanked Lindsay for her exceptional service and one of my friends gave her a hug. The recommended restaurant wa...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this mixed methods {{research}} was to explore and analyze visitors’ overall experience while they attended a museum exhibition, and examine how this experience was affected by previously using a virtual 3 dimensional representation of the museum itself. The research measured knowledge acquisition in a virtual museum, and compared this knowledge acquired between a virtual museum versus a real one, employing a series of questionnaires, unobtrusive observations, surveys, personal and group interviews related to the exhibition and the artist. A group of twenty-seven undergraduate students in their first semester at the College of Architecture and Design of the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico participated in the research, and were divided in two groups, one of which used a 3 D virtual representation previous to the museum visit. Results show that participants who experienced the virtual museum concurred that using it was a positive experience that prepared {{them to go to}} the real museum because they knew already what they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Most of the participants who experienced the virtual museum exhibited an increased activity during their museum visit, either agreeing, being more participative, concurring and showing acceptance, asking questions, or even giving their opinion and analysis, disagreeing with the guide and showing passive rejection. Also participants from this group showed an increase on their correct answers to the knowledge acquisition questionnaires, going from 27 % answers responded correctly in the pre-test, to 67 % of correct answers after the virtual museum usage. The research attempted to show that experiencing a virtual museum can be similar to the experience in physical museum visits, not only engaging participants to go to the museum, but sometimes even offering a more functional way to deliver content. Results of this research evidence that using a virtual museum creates a positive impact in users before, during, and after the museum visit, and that it can be a good alternative, not only for educational, but for promotional and recreational and purposes...|$|E
