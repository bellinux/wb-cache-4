2500|$|Initially her driving was {{restricted}} to rallying and driving tests, through which she eventually earned works drives {{for a number of}} manufacturers including BMC, Triumph and Ford. However, it was not long before she also began to take part in circuit races, and she worked her way up from her Javelin firstly to a Jaguar XK120, and then an Aston Martin DB2/4. It was while driving the Aston at Goodwood in 1955 that she overheard a male spectator's comment that she would later cite as a major motivating factor in her future career: [...] "Look, a woman driving. Oh, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of a beautiful motor car".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind is a terrible thing to waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.") ...|$|E

5000|$|Socialburn was a four-piece post-grunge {{band from}} Blountstown, Florida. Forming in 2000, the band {{released}} two independent albums, <b>What</b> <b>A</b> Beautiful <b>Waste</b> and World Outside, before being signed to Elektra Records in 2002. The band's major record label debut, Where You Are, {{was released in}} 2003, and spawned two charting singles - [...] "Down" [...] and [...] "Everyone". The band would later be dropped from their label on Elektra, but release a follow up, The Beauty of Letting Go, on smaller label [...] "iRock Entertainment" [...] in 2005.

5000|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in New York City, Dehn stumbled upon the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, an influential hotspot of African-American social dance. The dancing she found there was unlike anything she had ever seen—all of the energy of jazz {{she had come to}} love in Europe, with a characteristically American ease of movement. After immersing herself in the scene, Dehn realized <b>what</b> <b>a</b> tremendous <b>waste</b> it would be if such exceptional dancing was not somehow preserved for future generations. This sense of purpose took her away from her own dancing and became her life's work. Looking back on the matter years later, Dehn mused that [...] "I sacrificed my career to promote the tidal wave of black jazz, to film the greatest dancers of the Savoy.… My contribution is to have assembled and preserved these dances as presented by their greatest exponents." ...|$|R

The power of her face all lost, the charm of her emotions all disguised, the fascinations of her coquetry denied existence, nothing but a voice left to her; she {{had a sense of}} the doom of Echo. [...] "Nobody here respects me," [...] she said. She had overlooked the fact that, in coming as a boy among other boys, she would be treated as a boy. The slight, though of her own causing, and self-explanatory, she was unable to dismiss as unwittingly shown, so sensitive had the situation made her.|$|R
40|$|Sports {{occupies}} {{an interesting}} ethical space from a pedagogic point of view, being included {{in physical education}} curricula in most Western countries (Renaud, 2014). The approach of physical education as vehicle for ethical education, is too limited when restricted to its minimal functional, constitutive and regulatory goals (Gagliardini Graça M. L. and Lacerda T. O., 2012). The aim of this essay is to argue {{to what extent the}} ethical potential of physical education extrapolates them in order to, with Sousa Santos, state against to <b>what</b> we consider <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of sport’s experience (Sousa Santos, 2000). In order to achieve this, we present data from nineteen exploratory interviews with philosophy, sports and physical education experienced researchers and teachers concerning the ethical potentialities of physical education.

40|$|A &# 039;green&# 039;, {{sustainable}} resource, in {{the form}} of chicken feather derived keratin, was used to enhance the thermomechanical properties of polyurethane bio-composites. Solvent-casting-evaporation method was used to incorporate three levels of chicken feather fibers (0, 10 and 20 %·w/w) into a polyurethane matrix. The thermomechanical properties of the resulting composites were then assessed using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and stress-strain measurements with hysteresis loops. The uniformity of the dispersion of the keratin fiber in the plastic matrix was investigated via macro photography and optical microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy of fracture surfaces was used to verify that the adhesion between fiber and polymer was effective. Addition of chicken feather fibers to the polyurethane matrix was found to decrease the glass transition temperature, recovery strain and mass loss of the composites but increase the elastic modulus, storage modulus, and char level. The results demonstrate that keratin derived from <b>what</b> is currently <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product from the poultry industry (with significant disposal costs) can improve the thermo-mechanical properties of composites, simply and cheaply, with potentially large environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|In this workshop, we have {{participants}} envision <b>what</b> <b>a</b> zero <b>waste</b> campus {{would look}} like. We break the room into groups {{and give them}} a limited amount of time to draw or map out how they would prevent specific forms of waste from entering campus, how they would control the collection, logistics, and flow of waste through campus, and how they would manage the process of removing waste (if any) from campus. If time allows, we also tack on an additional step of designing innovative ideas for how students can cut down on the amount of <b>waste</b> produced within <b>a</b> campus. For example, a tool share could allow students to rent tools rather than having to buy them, similar to a bike share. Students may also envision a campus thrift store, a community garden, or an upcycling workshop space, as examples. Throughout the presentation we sprinkle in many key leadership lessons; how to communicate effectively with campus professionals, when and how to follow up, working with a team, facilitating and delegating tasks, negotiation strategy, and more. Once their visions have been mapped out, we run an exercise on power-mapping and discuss how students can go about implementing change on their campuses. Who do they need to talk to, how should they go about conducting those types of meetings and conversations, and where do they turn when they face hurdles and challenges along the way...|$|R
60|$|Shirley easily persuaded Caroline {{to go with}} her, {{and when}} they were fairly out on the quiet road, {{traversing}} the extensive and solitary sweep of Nunnely Common, she as easily drew her into conversation. The first feelings of diffidence overcome, Caroline soon felt glad to talk with Miss Keeldar. The very first interchange of slight observations sufficed to give each <b>an</b> idea of <b>what</b> the other was. Shirley said she liked the green sweep of the common turf, and, better still, the heath on its ridges, for the heath reminded her of moors. She had seen moors when she was travelling on the borders near Scotland. She remembered particularly a district traversed one long afternoon, on a sultry but sunless day in summer.

[...] Jolyon had murmured, {{looking at}} her faintly smiling lips; and he had gone away thinking: 'A {{fascinating}} woman! <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste!</b> I'm glad the Dad left her that money.' He had not seen her again, but every quarter he had signed her cheque, forwarding it to her bank, with a note to the Chelsea flat {{to say that he}} had done so; and always he had received a note in acknowledgment, generally from the flat, but sometimes from Italy; so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper, an upright fine handwriting, and the words, 'Dear Cousin Jolyon.' Man of property that he now was, the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought: 'Well, I suppose she just manages'; sliding into a vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed. At first Holly had spoken of her sometimes, but 'ladies in grey' soon fade from children's memories; and the tightening of June's lips in those first weeks after her grandfather's death whenever her former friend's name was mentioned, had discouraged allusion. Only once, indeed, had June spoken definitely: [...] "I've forgiven her. I'm frightfully glad she's independent now...." ...|$|E

He glanced at them all, stooping and swaying and gesticulating round the table-cloth. Amiable and modest, respectable in many ways, lovable even in their contentment and desire to be kind, how mediocre they all were, and capable of what insipid cruelty to one another! There was Mrs. Thornbury, sweet but trivial in her maternal egoism; Mrs. Elliot, perpetually complaining of her lot; her husband a mere pea in a pod; and Susan--she had no self, and counted neither one way nor the other; Venning was as honest and as brutal as a schoolboy; poor old Thornbury merely trod his round like a horse in a mill; and the less one examined into Evelyn's character the better, he suspected. Yet these were the people with money, and to them rather than to others was given {{the management of the}} world. Put among them some one more vital, who cared for life or for beauty, and what an agony, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> would they inflict on him if he tried to share with them and not to scourge! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{sat down}} and fell into a reverie, which perhaps was partly {{suggested}} by that chief furrow which he had seen, and which we have spoken of, in his brow. He considered whether there was anything in this pursuit of his that used up life particularly fast; so that, perhaps, unless he were successful soon, he should be incapable of renewal; for, looking within himself, and considering his mode of being, he had a singular fancy that his heart was gradually drying up, and that he must continue to get some moisture for it, or else it would soon be like a withered leaf. Supposing his pursuit were vain, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> he was making of that little treasure of golden days, which was his all! Could this be called life, which he was leading now? How unlike that of other young men! How unlike that of Robert Hagburn, for example! There had come news yesterday of his having performed a gallant part {{in the battle of}} Monmouth, and being promoted to be a captain for his brave conduct. Without thinking of long life, he really lived in heroic actions and emotions; he got much life in a little, and did not fear to sacrifice a lifetime of torpid breaths, if necessary, to the ecstasy of a glorious death! ...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{resource in}} the form of chicken feather derived keratin was used to enhance the thermomechanical properties of polysiloxane-polyurethane biocomposites. Two methods, solvent-casting-evaporation-compression molding, and solvent-precipitation- evaporation-compression molding were used to create new bio-composites incorporating 20 %·w/w of chicken feather fibers into a polysiloxane-polyurethane matrix and the results were compared. A molecular modelling visualization indicated the possible existence of hydrogen bonding between fibers and polyurethane molecules. The thermo-mechanical properties of both the polysiloxane polymer and feather reinforced bio-composites were assessed using thermogravimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and stress-strain measurements with hysteresis loops. The dispersion uniformity of the keratin fibers in the plastic matrix was investigated via macro photography. Addition of chicken feather fibers to the polysiloxane matrix was found to decrease the recovery strain and mass loss of the composites (at lower temperatures) but increase the elastic modulus, storage modulus, and char level (at higher temperatures). The results demonstrate that keratin derived from <b>what</b> is currently <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product from the poultry industry (with significant economic and environmental disposal costs) can improve the thermo-mechanical properties of the tested bio-composites simply and cheaply, with potentially large cost savings and environmental benefits...|$|R
