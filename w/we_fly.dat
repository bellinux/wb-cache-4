2500|$|During World War II, 4,000 Argentines {{served with}} all three British armed services, even though Argentina was officially a neutral country during the war. Over 600 Argentine volunteers served with both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force, mostly in No. 164 (Argentine) squadron, whose shield bore the sun from the Flag of Argentina and the motto, [...] "Determined <b>We</b> <b>Fly</b> (Firmes Volamos)".|$|E
2500|$|By October 2007, the USAF owned nine Reapers, and by December 2010 had 57 {{with plans}} to buy another 272, {{for a total of}} 329 Reapers. Critics have stated that the USAF's insistence on {{qualified}} pilots flying RPVs is a bottleneck to expanding deployment. USAF Major General William Rew stated on 5 August 2008, [...] "For the way <b>we</b> <b>fly</b> them right now"—fully integrated into air operations and often flying missions alongside manned aircraft—"we want pilots to fly them." [...] This reportedly has exacerbated losses of USAF aircraft in comparison with US Army operations. In March 2011, U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated that, while manned aircraft are needed, the USAF must recognize [...] "the enormous strategic and cultural implications of the vast expansion in remotely piloted vehicles..." [...] and stated that as the service buys manned fighters and bombers, it must give equal weight to unmanned drones and [...] "the service's important role in the cyber and space domains." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – To {{adequately}} image {{through a}} water column and to delineate variation in coral reef ecosystem benthic types, sensors having high spatial, e. g., a Cirrus digital camera system (DCS), and spectral, e. g., the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), resolution and high {{signal to noise}} are needed. Further, {{there is a need}} to better understand the optical properties of coral reefs, seagrass, other benthic types, and water column constituents from field-collected data so current and future remote sensing can be optimized for coastal zone ecosystem research and management. In August 2004, <b>we</b> <b>flew</b> the AVIRIS and DCS on a NASA ER- 2 over the Florida Keys and Puerto Rico. In March 2005, <b>we</b> <b>flew</b> AVIRIS/DCS on the Twin Otter ove...|$|R
