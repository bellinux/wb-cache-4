The {{advertisement}} noted a [...] "completely improvised feature film" [...] shot in a [...] "wooded location". Donahue described the audition as Myrick and Sánchez posing her the question: [...] "You've served seven years of a nine year sentence. Why should <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> out on parole?" [...] to which Donahue was required to improvise a response. Joshua Leonard, also in response to audition calls through Backstage, claimed he was cast in the film due to his knowledge of how to run a camera, as there was not an omniscient camera filming the scenes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Until the trial," [...] {{the other}} answered, {{standing}} a little {{away from him}} with his hand thrust suggestively into a pocket. [...] "We'll be glad {{to get rid of}} you when it's finished, but you certainly can't get away before <b>we</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go." ...|$|E
