50|$|At the French Grand Prix Button {{finished}} 8th, finally {{earning his}} and his team's first point of the season. This was a rare highlight as the car proved to be slow in subsequent races. The car put on its worst performance yet in Hungary where the RA107 {{proved to be the}} slowest car on the grid and Barrichello finished 18th and last. Honda debuted a front wing which looked very similar to the Spyker's <b>wing.</b> <b>Button</b> ran ahead of Adrian Sutil in the Spyker, but the RA107's throttle linkage failed before the Spyker could overtake during pitstops.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Alonso {{around the outside}} at Ascari corner on the same lap but Alonso closed the door on Hamilton. Webber took advantage but missed his braking point because his front wing stopped producing downforce which prevented him from reducing his speed and locked his tyres. He collided one of Hamilton's rear tyres, sending both drivers into the gravel trap. Both drivers managed to continue and Webber drove into the pit lane to replace his front <b>wing.</b> <b>Button</b> had maintained his lead upfront and crossed the start/finish line after 58 laps to win his first race of the 2010 season and his second consecutive Australian Grand Prix. Kubica finished second 12 seconds behind Button, with Massa in third. Alonso held off Rosberg in the final laps to finish fourth. Hamilton recovered to finish in sixth, Liuzzi took seventh with Barrichello close behind in eighth, Webber finished ninth and Schumacher passed de la Rosa on the final lap at Whiteford corner for tenth, the final points scoring position. de la Rosa fell behind fellow Spaniard Alguersuari to finish in twelfth with Kovalainen and Chandhok {{the last of the}} classified finishers.|$|E
50|$|Buzz wears a {{high-tech}} space suit, {{similar to those}} of modern-day astronauts though more streamlined and iconic. The suit chest features a control panel. On the left hand side of the suit, a large red button activates the suit's flight system, which are two purple wings with candy cane lining, and green and red <b>wing</b> tips. The <b>buttons</b> on the right of the suit have numerous functions such as contacting Star Command, shooting grappling hooks, and activating full throttle. On the toy Buzz of movies however, all they do is make Buzz say different catch phrases. Buzz's suit also protects against the vacuum and cold of space. It can also translate all he says into any language even an outer space dialect. A retractable helmet, when activated, covers Buzz's head and allows him to breathe in space or on planets lacking a sufficient supply of oxygen. The left arm of the suit has a panel that flips open to reveal a display that contains a mission log in the wrist area to record history and provide records. The right arm contains the weapon system which projects an unusually strong and powerful red-colored laser out of the small cannon {{on the back of the}} wrist. Buzz has a utility belt as an upgrade to suit. It has various things such as anti-gravity servos, magnets for climbing purposes, and a grappling hook.|$|R
