In contrast, we show that a continuous-time quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> cycles exhibit strong non-uniform mixing properties. Our results include the following: - The instantaneous distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> most even-length cycles is never uniform. - The average distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> any Abelian circulant graph is never uniform. As a corollary, the average distribution of a quantum <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> any standard circulant graph, such as the cycles, complete graphs, and even hypercubes, is never uniform.

40|$|We study biased random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> {{subcritical}} and supercritical Galton-Watson trees {{conditioned to}} survive in the transient, sub-ballistic regime. By considering offspring laws with infinite variance, we extend previously known results for the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the supercritical tree and observe new trapping phenomena for the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the subcritical tree which, in this case, always yield sub-ballisticity. This is contrary to the <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the supercritical tree which always has some ballistic phase. ...|$|R
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E

40|$|Pólya's {{random walk}} theorem states that a random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> a d-dimensional grid is {{recurrent}} for d= 1, 2 and transient for d> 3.

Namely, we prove that a non-backtracking random <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> a d-dimensional grid is recurrent for d= 2 and transient for d= 1, d> 3. Along the way, we prove several useful general facts about non-backtracking random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> graphs. In addition, our proof includes an exact enumeration {{of the number of}} closed non-backtracking random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> an infinite 2 -dimensional grid. This enumeration suggests an interesting combinatorial link between non-backtracking random <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> grids, and trinomial coefficients...|$|R
50|$|Toes are the digits of {{the foot}} of a tetrapod. Animal species such as cats that <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> their toes are {{described}} as being digitigrade.

5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Wever was not looked at by college recruiters {{due to a lack}} of {{competition}} he faced. As a result, he attended the University of California, Santa Barbara on an academic scholarship, and <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> to the school's baseball team. In three seasons with the Santa Barbara Gauchos, he had 18 wins, 17 losses, 199 strikeouts, and 15 complete games; the losses and complete games were at that time school records. After his junior year, Wever was drafted by the New York Yankees in the sixth round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft. He was given a signing bonus of $16,000, and officially signed with the team shortly after the draft concluded.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go behind the plate.|$|E

5|$|Eytel {{returned}} to Germany to study art for 18 months (1897–1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States.

Eytel often <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> his travels, covering 400 miles in the Colorado Desert on foot. On one of his travels he was nearly lynched as a horse thief and in 1918, during a trip to northern Arizona, he was threatened with lynching as a German spy.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E

During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E
