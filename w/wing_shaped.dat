40|$|ABSTRACT We {{measured}} {{variation and}} covariation in wing morphology in six {{populations of the}} fly Polietina orbitalis (Stein) (Diptera: Muscidae) to test for geographic morphological structure. Additionally, we examined the role of environmental variables in determining geographic variation in <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> We sampled five populations {{in the state of}} Paraná, southern Brazil (Colombo, Fênix, Guarapuava, Jundiaí do Sul and Ponta Grossa), and one in Paraguay (Mbaracayú). We choose 15 landmarks to describe the <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> and size and 19 environmental variables to describe the local environmental conditions. Our results showed that P. orbitalis <b>wing</b> <b>shape,</b> but not size, varies geographically. A canonical variate analysis showed the existence of two clusters of populations based on <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> These groups compare populations in which the wing is slender with groups in which the wings are broad. These shape differences were correlated with variation in elevation, precipitation and temperature but were not allometric. Taken together, these results suggest that <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> differences in P. orbitalis populations are due to a plastic response to local environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|Separating {{environmental}} effects on an organism's phenotype from genetic effects {{is not only}} of evolutionary interest, but also important in morphological taxonomy. Ideally, morphological traits to distinguish species are robust to environmental variation. In taxonomically difficult groups of insects such as aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> quantified by geometric morphometrics is increasingly used to distinguish cryptic species {{that are difficult to}} separate with other morphological characters. However, aphid parasitoids may use multiple host species; the validity of this approach thus hinges on <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> being a genetically hard-wired trait that is not strongly moulded by the host in which the parasitoid develops. The occurrence of asexual lines in the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall) provides an opportunity to test this assumption by rearing genetically identical individuals in different environments. We reared five asexual lines of L. fabarum in four different aphid species to quantify the relative importance of these factors on parasitoid <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> We found that the parasitoid genotype explains a much larger proportion of the observed variation in <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> than the host species. The host also significantly affected <b>wing</b> <b>shape,</b> but to a lesser extent, and largely via an effect on size (allometry), which can be corrected for. Our study shows that even at the level of lineages within a single species, the influence of the host environment is small relative to the genetic determination of <b>wing</b> <b>shape,</b> thus validating the use of this trait for taxonomic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Wing {{size and}} shape have {{important}} aerodynamic implications on flight performance. We explored how wing size was related to <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> in territorial males of 37 taxa of the damselfly family Calopterygidae. Wing coloration was {{also included in the}} analyses because it is sexually and naturally selected and {{has been shown to be}} related to <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> We studied <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> using both the non-dimensional radius of the second moment of wing area (RSM) and geometric morphometrics. Lower values of the RSM result in less energetically demanding flight and wider ranges of flight speed. We also re-analyzed previously published data on other damselflies and dragonflies. The RSM showed a hump-shaped relationship with wing size. However, after correcting for phylogeny using independent contrast, this pattern changed to a negative linear relationship. The basal genus of the study family, Hetaerina, was mainly driving that change. The obtained patterns were specific for the study family and differed from other damselflies and dragonflies. The relationship between the RSM and <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> measured by geometric morphometrics was linear, but relatively small changes along the RSM axis can result in large changes in <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> Our results also showed that wing coloration may have some effect on RSM. We found that RSM showed a complex relationship with size in calopterygid damselflies, probably as a result of other selection pressures besides wing size per se. Wing coloration and specific behavior (e. g. courtship) are potential candidates for explaining the complexity. Univariate measures of <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> such as RSM are more intuitive but lack the high resolution of other multivariate techniques such as geometric morphometrics. We suggest that the relationship between <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> and size are taxa-specific and differ among closely-related insect groups...|$|R

40|$|Animals {{that fly}} {{must be able}} to do so over a huge range of {{aerodynamic}} conditions, determined by weather, wind speed and the nature of their environment. No single parameter can be used to determine—let alone measure—optimum flight performance as it relates to <b>wing</b> <b>shape.</b> Reconstructing the <b>wings</b> of the extinct pterosaurs has therefore proved especially problematic: these Mesozoic flying reptiles had a soft-tissue membranous flight surface that is rarely preserved in the fossil record. Here, we review basic mechanical and aerodynamic constraints that influenced the <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> of pterosaurs, and, building on this, present a series of theoretical modelling results. These results allow us to predict the most likely <b>wing</b> <b>shapes</b> that could have been employed by these ancient reptiles, and further show that a combination of anterior sweep and a reflexed proximal wing section provides an aerodynamically balanced and efficient theoretical pterosaur <b>wing</b> <b>shape,</b> with clear benefits for their flight stability...|$|R
40|$|The <b>shape</b> of a <b>wing</b> {{influences}} the airflow over its surface and governs the aerodynamic forces {{acting on the}} <b>wing.</b> Therefore, <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> is tightly correlated with flight performance. For bats and birds, faster fliers generally have more slender and elongated wings (high aspect ratio), while slower fliers have more broad and short wings (low aspect ratio). The preferred flight speed, and therefore <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> of an animal is usually adapted to its habitat, foraging strategy, and flight behavior. We examined the relationship of aspect ratio and <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> (i. e., leading edge curvature and wing pointiness) of butterfly forewings, relative to habitat preferences, toxicity, and migration using geometric morphometrics. Pictures of 22 butterfly species from three different habitats (forest, open forest and open habitat) were digitized and analyzed using morphometric methods. Our preliminary {{results indicate that the}} previously shown relationship of <b>wing</b> <b>shape</b> and flight performance for larger fliers might not scale down to butterflies. We found a significant difference in aspect ratios for butterflies in different habitats. Suspected slower fliers had a higher aspect ratio than faster fliers. This could mean that we need to adjust our ecological interpretation of <b>wing</b> <b>shapes</b> for small fliers such as butterflies...|$|R

50|$|The Heron — The Heron is Hals ship. Hal {{was helping}} a ship-maker build it, {{and it was}} {{originally}} intended for {{an old man who}} later died. Then, as he wanted a ship, Hal bought it and finished building it, but adding a few of his own inventions. The ship is about half the size of a regular Skandian wolfship and carries 8 oars aside. He outfitted the ship with several upgrades, one being his ingenious triangular double sail plan which allows him to sail about 45 degrees into the wind instead of only 15, three times more than a normal wolfship. Because Hal based this design off of a heron (because of its <b>wing</b> <b>shaped</b> sail, and how it makes his ship glide over the water like a bird), he named his ship after a heron. Another upgrade is a daggerboard (fin) that is slightly off centre which is inserted through the bottom of the boat; this allows the sail handlers to trim the sails even more and get a greater speed out of the boat. The last improvement to the Heron is a giant crossbow, the mangler, {{at the front of the}} ship, which is on a swiveled platform, but difficult to handle unless you are very strong.
