5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened on}} 17December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour {{residents}} <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> old bridge to commemorate its closure, then walked {{back across the}} new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation.|$|E

25|$|June 15, 1980: Franklin {{shot and}} killed Arthur Smothers (22) and Kathleen Mikula (16) with a high-powered rifle as the couple <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Washington Street Bridge in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Smothers was black; Mikula was white. On {{the day of the}} murder, Franklin took a {{concealed}} position on a wooded hillside overlooking downtown Johnstown and waited for potential targets to enter his line of sight. He was never arrested for these murders, but he confessed to them during a jailhouse interview after he was apprehended.|$|E
25|$|Lord Raglan's Hero Pattern lists many {{religious}} figures whose bodies disappear, or {{have more than}} one sepulchre. B. Traven, author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, wrote that the Inca Virococha arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> water and vanished. It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.|$|E

After the pin, Koloff slowly <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> ring while the ref {{raised his hand}} three times, and the announcer came into the ring with the championship belt; however, fearful of a riot, he did not present it to Koloff. Koloff left the ring while Sammartino stayed inside to keep the crowd's attention off Koloff. As Sammartino left the ring, people started crying. Three weeks later, Pedro Morales beat Koloff to win the title, and Sammartino congratulated the new champion as he was announced.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
25|$|As more {{officers}} converged, Farook <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street towards some homes {{while continuing}} to fire, pinning officers behind their squad cars. He intended to flank the sheriff's deputy who had first stopped. Realizing this, several officers repositioned themselves and focused their gunfire on Farook. One police officer eventually shot Farook in the right side, allowing others to flank and shoot at him. Farook fell to the ground, shot {{several times in the}} legs and upper body. He fired at the police once with a handgun as he lay wounded on the ground, injuring an officer before the gun malfunctioned. Farook was shot again several times and killed. His body was handcuffed and positioned to lie face-down afterwards.|$|E

They were joined by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed {{who had been with}} them in their initial flight from Cairo. Hamed had arranged for JAT, a Yugoslav national airline to take the men from Fiumicino (Rome's main airport) to Belgrade. With no objections from Craxi, at 5:30p.m. EgyptAir flight 2843 flew the 10 minutes from Ciampino airport to Fiumicino. Abbas and Badrakkan left the Egyptian plane, <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> ramp escorted by Italian security forces and embarked on the Yugoslav aircraft. They left for Belgrade, Yugoslavia at 7:10p.m., Saturday, October 12, 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{funeral service}} and requiem mass went ahead as planned, and the cortege {{made its way}} to Milltown Cemetery, off the Falls Road. Present were {{thousands}} of mourners and top members of the IRA and Sinn Féin, including Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Two RUC helicopters hovered overhead. Stone claimed that he entered the graveyard through the front gate with the mourners. Some eyewitnesses claimed to have seen Stone enter the graveyard from the M1 motorway with three other people (two men and a woman). The others <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> graveyard and later left on the Falls Road side. As the third coffin was about to be lowered into the ground, Stone threw two grenades—which had a seven-second delay—toward the republican plot and began shooting.|$|E
25|$|Chaisson talked Kỳ's marines into pulling back, and {{relieved}} {{them with a}} company of his marines on the western banks of the bridge. He then asked permission from rebel officer to place his marines {{on the other side}} of the bridge, but was rejected. Chaisson ignored the rebel officer and ordered his men to deploy to the Struggle Movement positions anyway. The Americans simply sat down on the road among the rebels without using any force. Walt then arrived and he and Chaisson <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge. They never reached the other side, as a rebel warrant officer ordered them to halt, threatening to explode the bridge. In the meantime, the rebels fired machine guns low at the Americans, briefly forcing them to duck.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E
25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works. For example, four {{different}} steps must occur {{to be able to}} lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied {{depending on the type of}} surface being <b>walked</b> <b>across.</b> <b>The</b> leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.|$|E

500|$|Back in Liverpool, {{his father}} put {{his son in}} charge of the record {{department}} of the family's newly opened NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street. Epstein worked [...] "day and night" [...] at the store to make it a success, and it became one of the biggest musical retail outlets in Northern England. The Epsteins opened a second store at 12–14 Whitechapel, and Epstein was put {{in charge of the}} entire operation. He often <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> road to the Lewis's department store (which also had a music section) where Peter Brown was employed. He watched Brown's sales technique and was impressed enough to lure him to work for NEMS with the offer of a higher salary and a commission on sales.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2008, Beghe {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. He addressed the 50 protesters gathered {{across the street from}} the Scientology building, and told them: [...] "What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe. Then they hung up." ...|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E
