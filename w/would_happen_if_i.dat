500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E

What if I were wounded and made crazy, what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson Benson {{writes that}} how a writer {{transforms}} biographical events into art {{is more important}} than looking for connections between Hemingway's life and his fiction. He believes autobiographical events may have a [...] "very tenuous relationship" [...] to the fiction similar to a dream from which a drama emerges. Hemingway's later fiction, Benson writes [...] "is like an adolescent day-dream in which he acts out infatuation and consummation, as in Across the River." [...] Meyers agrees that parallels exist between Hemingway and Colonel Cantwell, but he sees more similarities with Hemingway's friend of many decades [...] "Chink" [...] Dorman-Smith, whose military career was undermined causing his demotion. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way that}} I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were sent back to the front?" [...] For example, he describes Hemingway's experiences in the World War II [...] battle of the [...] Battle of Hürtgen Forest succinctly as [...] "Passchendaele with tree bursts." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1959, Simpson {{left for}} France with £100 savings and two Carlton bikes, one road and one track, given in {{appreciation}} of his help promoting the company.

Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The game is {{narrated by}} the old Graham and his granddaughter Gwendolyn. Player's actions in the game change the narrative. For instance, {{performing}} certain actions unlocks additional dialogue. When players make wrong decisions and die, Graham replies with phrases such as [...] "That’s what <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did that," [...] before players re-spawn. Players also make decisions throughout the game that are divided into three different approaches, bravery, wisdom, and compassion. Actions performed by players have consequences and impact the game's story, and as a result, change the game's overall experience. Most of these choices are game play-based. According to Korba, all the choices made by Graham are heroic, {{and there is no}} way for players to build a [...] "bad" [...] Graham.|$|R

60|$|From {{breakfast on}} I {{felt like a}} bag-snatcher at a railway station. I had to hang about waiting for the parcel {{to be put on}} the hall table, and it wasn't put. Uncle Willoughby was a fixture in the library, adding the {{finishing}} touches to the great work, I supposed, and the more I thought the thing over the less I liked it. The chances against my pulling it off seemed about three to two, and the thought of what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't gave me cold shivers down the spine. Uncle Willoughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy, as a rule, but I've known him to cut up rough, and, by Jove, he was scheduled to extend himself if he caught me trying to get away with his life work.|$|E

For a long while he watched in vain; everything seemed asleep, and not even a bird stirred overhead. The fox grew crosser than ever, {{and he was just}} turning away in disgust from his place when he heard the sound of feet coming over the snow. He crouched eagerly down {{at the edge of the}} road and said to himself: 'I wonder what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to pretend to be dead! This is a man driving a reindeer sledge, I know the tinkling of the harness. And at any rate I shall have an adventure, and that is always something!' ...|$|E

Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. [...] "There was no other choice back then," [...] she pointed out to the interviewer. [...] "There was no girls team to play on." [...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie is really what <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what people would think of me.

6000|$|One of {{the many}} curses of our life out here is the want of {{atmosphere}} in the painter's sense. There are no half-tints worth noticing. Men stand out all crude and raw, with nothing to tone them down, and nothing to scale them against. They do their work, and grow {{to think that there}} is nothing but their work, and nothing like their work, and that they are the real pivots on which the administration turns. Here is an instance of this feeling. A half-caste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office. He said to me:--"Do you know what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> added or took away one single line on this sheet?" [...] Then, with the air of a conspirator:--"It would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the whole of the Presidency Circle! Think of that?" ...|$|E

So weak are they, and so terrible is he, that I swear he could whip either watch single-handed. I cannot help but note that Mr. Mellaire refuses {{to take part in}} this driving. Yet I know that he is a trained driver, and that he was not averse to driving {{at the outset of the}} voyage. But now he seems bent on keeping on good terms with the crew. I should like to know what Mr. Pike thinks of it, for he cannot {{possibly}} be blind to what is going on; but I am too well aware of what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> raised the question. He would insult me, snap my head off, and indulge in a three-days' sea-grouch. Things are sad and monotonous enough for Margaret and me in the cabin and at table, without invoking the blight of the mate's displeasure.|$|E
60|$|Dear madam, {{you see how}} it <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went there. He {{would ask}} me those questions, and I would try to answer them to suit him, and he would hunt me {{here and there and}} yonder and get me embarrassed more and more all the time, and at last he would look tired on account of overwork, and there it would end and nothing done. I wish I could be useful to you, but, you see, they do not care for uncles or any of those things; it doesn't move them, it doesn't have the least effect, they don't care for {{anything}} but the literature itself, and they as good as despise influence. But they do care for books, and are eager to get them and examine them, no matter whence they come, nor from whose pen. If you will send yours to a publisher--any publisher--he will certainly examine it, I can assure you of that.|$|E
5000|$|This version, [...] "The Law of The Jungle", was {{released}} {{as part of}} his Cast of Characters (2005) box set and was inspired by a want-ad he read whilst idly scanning the personals one day.

Although {{the allies}} {{had won the}} field, the French {{prevented}} them from coming {{to the aid of}} the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington's Anglo-allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre. There has been much debate about what <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> d'Erlon's <b>I</b> Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras.

The video depicts Luke starting out in the usual tutorial manner, however she is depicted using foundation to cover up bruises from an implied beating. While Luke was already well known in the UK, the video was promoted by the National Organization for Women in the United States, and reported on internationally. Luke noted that, [...] "The bruising on my face for the video wasn't real, but my emotions in that video were. I had a bad experience in the past with a previous boyfriend. He never physically hurt me but I did sometimes fear what <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> next <b>if</b> <b>I</b> said the wrong thing. He could be overprotective and embarrass me in front of my work colleagues or friends because of his aggressive behavior. Sometimes it was like living with a volcano which could erupt at any second—I felt I was walking on egg shells just to keep him from exploding and smashing something across the room." ...|$|R
