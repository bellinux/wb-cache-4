5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found {{a house in the}} residential area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Mohammad Alavi {{was heavily}} involved in the level's development. Alavi sought to explain why Russia would invade the United States, and have the player make an emotional connection with Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, as Alavi did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> feel too contrived or traumatic. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward and publisher Activision were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several game testers expressed disapproval, with one game tester refusing to play the level at all.|$|E

5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated that he did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps {{under the aegis of the}} SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E

5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to.</b> The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Northern Ireland in 1921, there has been tension and violence between its two main religious groups. Unionists/Ulster loyalists (who are mostly Ulster Protestant) generally want Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, while Irish nationalists/republicans (who are mostly Catholic) generally <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland. The former generally identify with the Union Flag, while the latter generally do not and instead identify with the Irish tricolour.|$|E

In 1854, A German philologist named Karl Richard Lepsius made a “Standard Alphabet”, meant for all the languages of the world. In 1882, Britain enacted an educational ordinance to direct the teaching of reading and writing only in English which temporarily inhibited the development of Igbo along with other languages of West Africa.|$|E

Bhim Chand wanted the elephant to make a display of his wealth to the guests at his son's proposed wedding.

He stated that the devotee who had presented the elephant didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be given away to anybody else. Bhim Chand is said to have sent his emissaries thrice to the Guru, the last one being Raja Kesari Chand of Jaswal. However, the Guru didn't accept his demand, and refused to part with the elephant.|$|E
