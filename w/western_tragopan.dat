5000|$|Jujurana (<b>western</b> <b>Tragopan)</b> Population Distribution. Five {{populations are}} known from Kohistan, Kaghan valley, Kishtwar, Chamba, Kullu and an area {{east of the}} Satluj river. They are found from an {{altitude}} of 1,750 to 3,600 m, going higher in summer. Their preferred habitat is the dense understorey of temperate, subalpine and broad-leaved forest. In Salooni <b>western</b> <b>Tragopan</b> {{can be found at}} Gamgul Sanctuary and nearby places.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> is threatened by several anthropogenic factors throughout its range. The world population is estimated at fewer than 5,000 individuals, including a captive breeding population in Himachal Pradesh which numbered fewer than ten pairs in 2012. CITES has listed this species in Appendix I in order to discourage selling of its feathers. Representing the endemic bird area D02 of Western Himalaya, the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> {{has been described as}} a range-restricted species.|$|E
50|$|Threatened species {{include the}} snow leopard, Indian leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Indian wolf, Kashmir gray langur, rhesus macaque, markhor, Siberian ibex, white-bellied musk deer and Kashmir red deer.Bird species present are cheer pheasant, {{peregrine}} falcon and <b>western</b> <b>tragopan.</b>|$|E

50|$|Among {{the birds}} found here are <b>western</b> <b>tragopans</b> and Himalayan monals. Several surveys on other wildlife, {{including}} one on musk deer by Naeem Ashraf Raja, {{have also been}} compiled by experts.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Populations of <b>Western</b> <b>Tragopans</b> Tragopan melanocephalus {{were studied}} at two areas (Machiara and Salkhala) in the Neelum Valley of northeastern Pakistan. A total of 130 {{sightings}} of birds was noted during the breeding seasons in 1982 and 1983, but only 100 were re-located for vegetation analysis. More sightings of birds were recorded at Machiara; 54...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> is {{considered}} the rarest of all living pheasants. Its range is very restricted. In Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, this bird is locally called jujurana which means [...] "king of birds". It was accorded the status of state bird of Himachal Pradesh in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> or western {{horned tragopan}} (Tragopan melanocephalus) is a {{medium-sized}} brightly plumed pheasant found along the Himalayas from north-eastern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northern Pakistan {{in the west to}} Uttarakhand within India to the east. The species is highly endangered and globally threatened.|$|E
50|$|The fauna of Pakistan also {{reflects}} the country's varied climate. Around 668 bird species are found there, including crows, sparrows, mynas, hawks, falcons, and eagles. Palas, Kohistan, {{has a significant}} population of <b>western</b> <b>tragopan.</b> Many birds sighted in Pakistan are migratory, coming from Europe, Central Asia, and India.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{found here}} include several {{endangered}} {{species such as}} the golden eagle, the steppe eagle and the black eagle, the bearded vulture, the Himalayan snowcock, the Himalayan monal pheasant, the cheer pheasant and the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan.</b> Smaller birds include owls, pigeons, minivets, thrushes, warblers, bulbuls, parakeets, cuckoos, tits, buntings and finches.|$|E
50|$|About 285 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in this ecoregion, including 9 endemic species {{and a number of}} birds that are sensitive to habitat disturbance and therefore likely to be vulnerable to further forest clearance. These include the Koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan melanocephalus), and the Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus).|$|E
50|$|Kohistan {{is where}} the Hindukush, Karakuram and Himalayan {{mountain}} systems meet {{and serve as a}} natural boundary for environmental regions in the chains of the Himalayas, Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountains. This uniqueness of the mountains system also results in rich flora and fauna and therefore gives home to unique species such as the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> pheasant and the snow leopard.|$|E
50|$|Home to 32 of the 52 {{species of}} {{pheasants}} {{found in the}} world, the pheasantry now covers just over 21 acre. Peafowl, the crested kalij, Lady Amherst, Siamese fireback, <b>western</b> <b>tragopan,</b> blue eared pheasant, brown eared pheasant, white eared pheasant, ring-necked pheasant, cheer pheasant, and the Himalayan monal {{are just some of}} the species housed by the pheasantry that are explored in the documentary.|$|E
50|$|It inhabits upper {{temperate}} forests between 2,400 and 3,600 m in summer, and in winter, dense coniferous and broad-leaved forests between 2,000 and 2,800 m elevations. The <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> is mostly arboreal but feeds on the ground. They feed mostly on leaves, shoots and seeds, but also consume insects and other invertebrates. Like most pheasants, they roost in trees singly or in pairs except during nesting.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{a spiritual}} element to this film that investigates {{the nature of}} {{conservation}} {{is the story of}} Welsh ecologist Robert Whale. Whale's decision to get married and stay back in Pakistan is an important element of the story being told. He made a deal with God, that if he {{caught a glimpse of the}} infamous <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> on film, he would embrace Islam. Now known as Rab Nawaz, he converted to Islam in 1998.|$|E
5000|$|The Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary is an abode to {{many species}} of animals {{including}} the Himalayan brown bear, [...] Himalayan black bear, musk deer, leopard, Tibetan wolf, Himalayan palm civet [...] and around 50 individuals the critically endangered Pir Panjal markhor. Besides, 130 species of birds including the spotted forktail, <b>western</b> <b>tragopan,</b> rock bunting, rufous-breasted accentor, Himalayan woodpecker, blue rock thrush, white-capped redstart, Himalayan griffon, common stonechat and grey wagtail {{are found in the}} sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|About 315 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in this ecoregion from tiny warblers to large pheasants such as the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> (Tragopan melanocephalus), satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) and cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi). Near-endemic birds of the forests include the white-cheeked tit, white-throated tit, spectacled finch, Kashmir flycatcher, Tytler's leaf-warbler, orange bullfinch, and Kashmir nuthatch, while the Himalayan quail {{which used to be}} found here is now thought to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|Like the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan,</b> it {{does not}} extend its range above the tree line. One of the less {{colourful}} pheasants, the koklass exhibits moderate sexual dimorphism. Though they skulk under bushes, which makes direct sighting difficult, they give loud chorus/predawn calls during the breeding season and during autumn, revealing their presence. They remain in pairs or small family groups throughout the year. They nest {{on the ground and}} spend the nights roosting on trees, or under rock overhangs.|$|E
50|$|The valley has varied biodiversity, It {{has some}} of the rarest of animals like Himalayan tahr, <b>western</b> <b>tragopan,</b> monal and Himalayan brown bear. The Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) is also located here. The park was built in 1984. It spreads over an area of 1,171 km2 which lies between an {{altitude}} of 1500 to 6000 m. In order to protect the flora and fauna of this Himalayan area, many places are declared as wildlife sanctuaries, such as: Khokhan Sanctuary, Kais Sanctuary, Tirthan Sanctuary, Kanawar Sanctuary, Rupi Baba Sanctuary, Great Himalayan National Park and Van Vihar Manali.|$|E
50|$|Palas Valley is a {{potential}} biosphere reserve located in Kohistan District of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The valley is home to rare and endemic wildlife and flora. The largest population of the endangered <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> {{can be found in}} the valley. Palas also supports population of 7 other rare species of birds including Tytler's leaf warbler. In 2003, a field mission conducted detailed studies of the region to determine its potential for World Heritage Site or MAB Biosphere Reserve. Their study concluded that the region has the attributes for a biosphere reserve however certain issues persist such continued preservation of the valley and involvement of the local population.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} highlands include lower elevation {{areas of}} Potohar and Azad Kashmir regions and higher elevation areas embracing {{the foothills of}} Himalayan, Karakorum and Hindukush mountain ranges. Some of the wildlife species found on northern mountainous areas and Pothohar Plateau include the non-threatened mammal species of bharal, Eurasian lynx, Himalayan goral, Indian leopard, Marco Polo sheep, marmot (in Deosai National Park) and yellow-throated marten and birds species of chukar partridge, Eurasian eagle-owl, Himalayan monal and Himalayan snowcock and amphibian species of Himalayan toad and Muree Hills frog. The threatened ones include Asiatic black bear, Himalayan brown bear, Indian wolf, Kashmir gray langur, Kashmir red deer, markhor, rhesus macaque, Siberian ibex, smooth-coated otter and white-bellied musk deer, bird species of cheer pheasant, peregrine falcon, <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> and reptile species of mugger crocodile.|$|E
40|$|Western tragopans are {{endemic to}} the Western Himalaya region of South Asia and are {{threatened}} by change in land-use, hunting and fragmentation of its habitat. Here, we map the known distribution pattern and potential habitat of the largest surviving population, which occurs in the Palas Valley, Kohistan, NWFP, Pakistan. Although listed as globally Vulnerable, the <b>western</b> <b>tragopan</b> population in Palas is thought to comprise about 1000 birds, perhaps because the valley holds the least degraded tract of Himalayan moist temperate forest in Pakistan.
