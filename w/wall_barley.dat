50|$|Hordeum murinum, {{commonly}} known as <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> or false barley, is a species of grass.|$|E
50|$|Meadow-type {{vegetation}} {{is developed}} in the park on chals (humid lowerings on the relief). The herbage is two-layered and is formed of Alhagi (first layer) and Aeluropus repens (second layer). In some places Artemisia and <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum leporinum) are found.|$|E
40|$|Ribosomes can be {{released}} from highly purified preparations of the cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> shoots by passing the suspension of cell walls through a French press. The sedimentation coefficients and base composition of the cell-wall ribosomes are identical with those of cytoplasmic ribosomes. It is suggested that the ribosomes isolated from the walls were originally incorporated into the wall structure during formation of the primary wall...|$|R
40|$|The cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare var. Himalaya) {{aleurone}} layers undergo extensive degradation {{during the}} tissue's response to gibberellic acid. Previous work {{had shown that}} these cell walls consist almost entirely of arabinoxylan. In this study we show that gibberellic acid stimulates endo-β- 1, 4 -xylanase activity in isolated aleurone layers. In addition, gibberellic acid enhances the activity of two glycosidases: β-xylopyranosidase and α-arabinofuranosidase. No gibberellic acid-stimulated cellulase activity was detected. Germination studies showed a similar pattern of enzyme development in intact seeds...|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{industry of}} Ål is mostly small-farming. Many livestock farms {{are still in}} operation with small herds of sheep, dairy cattle, and goats. Crop growing is difficult because of the steep valley <b>walls,</b> but wheat, <b>barley,</b> rye, and potatoes have all been grown in the past.|$|R
50|$|The {{semi-desert}} type {{of vegetation}} {{is represented by}} formations of sveda and ephemeral wormwood. The latter formation, which occupies 40% of the park area, has the richest species composition. Wormwood dominates, and among ephemera 20-25 species are met, including mast cereals: Poa bulbosa, Bromus, <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum leporinum), etc.|$|E
50|$|Hordeum murinum is {{an annual}} winter species whose seeds {{germinate}} and {{develop in the}} spring. It is {{also referred to as}} <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> and are tetraploids. It is distinct from other species of the genus because of its morphology and molecular genetics. It is also distinct because of the barriers it has with the Hordeum taxa when it comes to its ability to cross with it.|$|E
50|$|Hordeum murinum {{complex is}} the most {{widespread}} {{of all the other}} Hordeum species. The center of distribution of Hordeum murinum is in the Mediterranean area, Central Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. A greater quantity of dry material is produced with medium precipitation and better distribution. Precipitation {{is the most}} important factor in the production of seeds for this species. In the years that are more dry with early or late rainfalls, there is no chance of re-seeding for this species. The species uses a greater part of its reproductive resources for seed production, allowing it to adapt to different water conditions. Controlling the seeding rate favors high-quality strand of barley. The sowing rate for <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> increases when seed production and forage increases. This helps to obtain ideal and sustainable forage and seed yield in rangelands of Jordan. The height of the plant and protein content does not respond to seeding rates, but the height of the plant and protein content does vary with years. Anatomical characteristics of leaf blades differ between the taxa. This weedy species along with hare barley and smooth barley can be hard to control.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{class of}} highly {{abundant}} polypeptides with antifungal activity has been detected in cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> leaves. Similar polypeptides known as thionins occur {{not only in}} monocotyledonous but also in various dictoyledonous plants. The leaf-specific thionins of barley are encoded by a complex multigene family, which consists of at least 50 - 100 members per haploid genome. All of these genes are confined to chromosome 6. The toxicity of these thionins for plant pathogenic fungi {{and the fact that}} their synthesis can also be triggered by pathogens strongly suggest that thionins are a naturally occurring, inducible plant protein possibly involved in the mechanism of plant defence against microbial infections...|$|R
40|$|The <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare var. Himalaya) {{aleurone}} {{cells are}} composed of two major polysaccharides, arabinoxylan (85 %) and cellulose (8 %). The cell wall preparations contain 6 % protein, but this protein does not contain detectable amounts of hydroxyproline. The arabinoxylan has a linear 1, 4 -xylan backbone; 33 % of the xylosyl residues are substituted at the 2 and/or 3 position with single arabinofuranosyl residues. The results of in vitro cellulose binding experiments {{support the hypothesis that}} noncovalent bonds between the arabinoxylan chains and cellulose fibers play a part in maintaining wall structure. It is suggested that bonding between the arabinoxylan chains themselves is also utilized in forming the walls...|$|R
40|$|Four ruminally and duodenally cannualated heifers {{were used}} to study the ruminal {{degradation}} of cell <b>wall</b> constituents of <b>barley</b> (B), barley fibre (BF) and wheat mill rum (WMR) using the nylon bag technique. The subsequent postruminal degradation of the feeds and their rumen - undegraded residues was determined by using a modified nylon bag technique, also called mobile bag technique in order to quantify the degradability of cell wall constituents {{in different parts of}} the gastro-intestinal tract...|$|R
5000|$|Herbland {{dominated}} by introduced plants: 600-800 m ASL, {{mainly on the}} central plateau. This habitat is almost entirely a consequence of overgrazing; hardly anything of the original ecosystem remains. Dominant introduced plants are Avena barbata, Bromus berteroanus, great brome (B. diandrus), soft brome (B. hordeaceus sspp. hordaceus and mollis), red brome (B. madritensis ssp. rubens), tocalote (Centaurea melitensis), nettle-leaved goosefoot (Chenopodium murale), Filago californica, <b>wall</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum murinum sspp. glaucum and leporinum), crystalline iceplant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), M. nodiflorum, Polypogon monspeliensis and Sisymbrium orientale. The non-endemic natives dwarf coastweed (Amblyopappus pusillus), island false bindweed (Calystegia macrostegia ssp. macrostegia), Cryptantha maritima var. maritima, Filago arizonica, Gilia nevinii, California goldfields (Lasthenia californica), Pectocarya palmeri and Perityle emoryi {{as well as the}} endemics Cryptantha foliosa and Sphaeralcea palmeri can be found here also; some are still numerous. This probably was a mesic shrub/herbland before the goats destroyed the upland forest, upsetting the water supply. Native plants still found on Guadalupe, like Crossosoma californicum, laurel sumac (Malosma laurina) and the endemic Camissonia guadalupensis ssp. guadalupensis, presumably thrived here in former times, as would have such taxa as the native hoary-leaved ceanothus (Ceanothus crassifolius), wedge-leaved ceanothus (C. cuneatus) - and possibly also felt-leaved ceanothus (C. arboreus), which was found in 2001-2003 surveys -, Cammisonia robusta, red-flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) and the endemic Hesperalea palmeri, which have now disappeared from the island.|$|E
5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, <b>wall</b> <b>barley,</b> yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|E
40|$|In animal systems, the gamma-glutamyl cycle {{enables the}} {{recovery}} of extracellular glutathione by its degradation catalized by a membrane-bound enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Only recently this enzyme has gained attention also in plant science, and its subcellular localization has been ascribed to the membrane/cell wall compartment. The significance of a specific expression in different organs/tissues of different isoforms in Arabidopsis has however provided no insight about GGT physiological functions in plants. In this work we demonstrate, by immunohistochemical analysis, that GGT is almost exclusively localized in the cell <b>wall</b> of <b>barley</b> roots. We also show enzymehistochemically that GGT activity is high in the root tip and cortex. By the use of GGT activity inhibitors and diamide treatment, we describe variations in thiol content in roots and growth solution that are compatible with {{the existence of a}} gamma-glutamyl cycle in roots which assists {{the recovery of}} extracellular glutathione and may participate to the control of the apoplastic redox state. The ecophysiological implications of this findings will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} use of specific biochemical compounds identified in wheat grains was evaluated for monitoring barley grain tissues during fractionation. First barley grain anatomy was studied through microscopic observation and quantification {{of the relative}} proportion of each anatomical part in four distinct barley samples from both hulled and hulless genotypes. As expected from cereal phylogeny and irrespective of the possible presence of hull, common features were observed between barley and wheat grains, but the aleurone layer predominated in the outer layers. The specific location of the coumpounds identified in wheat was established. Phytic acid was specifically localized in the aleurone layer and alkylresorcinols in the composite layer containing the testa, even if their concentration differed from that observed in wheat grain tissues. Thus, these two markers identified in wheat {{can be used to}} monitor the corresponding barley tissues, independent of the presence of hulls. Conversely, phenolic compounds, either ferulic acid trimer or p-coumaric acid, cannot be used to monitor respectively the outer pericarp or the aleurone cell <b>walls</b> in <b>barley</b> grains. p-coumaric acid was identified as an efficient marker of the hull and could be used to distinguish hulled or hulless barley grains and to help monitor the dehulling process...|$|R
40|$|The CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE C (CSLC) {{family is}} an ancient lineage within the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE/CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE (CESA/CSL) {{polysaccharide}} synthase superfamily that {{is thought to have}} arisen before the divergence of mosses and vascular plants. As studies in the flowering plant Arabidopsis have suggested synthesis of the (1, 4) -β-glucan backbone of xyloglucan (XyG), a wall polysaccharide that tethers adjacent cellulose microfibrils to each other, as a probable function for the CSLCs, CSLC function was investigated in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a species with low amounts of XyG in its <b>walls.</b> Four <b>barley</b> CSLC genes were identified (designated HvCSLC 1 – 4). Phylogenetic analysis reveals three well supported clades of CSLCs in flowering plants, with barley having representatives in two of these clades. The four barley CSLCs were expressed in various tissues, with in situ PCR detecting transcripts in all cell types of the coleoptile and root, including cells with primary and secondary cell walls. Co-expression analysis showed that HvCSLC 3 was coordinately expressed with putative XyG xylosyltransferase genes. Both immuno-EM and membrane fractionation showed that HvCSLC 2 was located in the plasma membrane of barley suspension-cultured cells and was not in internal membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Based on our current knowledge of the sub-cellular locations of polysaccharide synthesis, we conclude that the CSLC family probably contains more than one type of polysaccharide synthase. Fenny M.

40|$|Cell {{walls in}} the grasses contain {{relatively}} high levels of heteroxylans and, in particular, arabinoxylans. Enzymes and corresponding genes {{that are involved in}} the provision of sugar nucleotide substrates represent potential control points for arabinoxylan biosynthesis. Following expressed sequence tag database analyses, three genes encoding barley (Hordeum vulgare) UDP-D-xylose 4 -epimerases (UXE; EC 5. 1. 3. 5), designated HvUXE 1, HvUXE 2, and HvUXE 3, were cloned and their positions on genetic maps defined. To confirm the identity of the genes, a cDNA construct encoding HvUXE 1 was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The purified, recombinant HvUXE 1 catalyzed the freely reversible interconversion of UDP-{alpha}-D-xylopyranose and UDP-β-L-arabinopyranose, with Km values of 1. 8 and 1. 4 mM, respectively. At equilibrium, the ratio of substrate to product was approximately 1 : 1. Each molecule of heterologously expressed HvUXE 1 enzyme contained about one molecule of noncovalently bound NAD+. Molecular modeling provided a structural rationale for the substrate specificity of the UDP-D-xylose 4 -epimerase and, in particular, explained its tight specificity for UDP-xylose compared with other sugar nucleotide epimerases. Quantitative transcript analyses performed {{for each of the three}} genes in a range of organs showed, inter alia, that in developing barley endosperm HvUXE 1 and HvUXE 3 mRNA levels peaked at a time when UDP-{alpha}-D-xylopyranose synthase (UXS) transcripts also reached a maximum and when arabinoxylan biosynthesis was initiated. Furthermore, the data revealed that the transcription of HvUXE and HvUXS gene family members is coordinated with the incorporation of pentose sugars onto cell <b>walls</b> in <b>barley</b> leaves, roots, and developing endosperm.

40|$|Background - The {{ability to}} {{increase}} cellulose content {{and improve the}} stem strength of cereals could have beneficial applications in stem lodging and producing crops with higher cellulose content for biofuel feedstocks. Here, such potential is explored in the commercially important crop barley through the manipulation of cellulose synthase genes (CesA). Results - Barley plants transformed with primary cell wall (PCW) and secondary cell <b>wall</b> (SCW) <b>barley</b> cellulose synthase (HvCesA) cDNAs driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter, were analysed for growth and morphology, transcript levels, cellulose content, stem strength, tissue morphology and crystalline cellulose distribution. Transcript levels of the PCW HvCesA transgenes were much lower than expected and silencing of both the endogenous CesA genes and introduced transgenes was often observed. These plants showed no aberrant phenotypes. Although attempts to over-express the SCW HvCesA genes also resulted in silencing of the transgenes and endogenous SCW HvCesA genes, aberrant phenotypes were sometimes observed. These included brittle nodes and, with the 35 S:HvCesA 4 construct, a more severe dwarfing phenotype, where xylem cells were irregular in shape and partially collapsed. Reductions in cellulose content were also observed in the dwarf plants and transmission electron microscopy showed {{a significant decrease in}} cell wall thickness. However, there were no increases in overall crystalline cellulose content or stem strength in the CesA over-expression transgenic plants, despite the use of a powerful constitutive promoter.

40|$|Published: 17 October 2014 BACKGROUND: (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-Glucan is an {{important}} component of the cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> grain as it affects processability during the production of alcoholic beverages and has significant human health benefits when consumed above recommended threshold levels. This leads to diametrically opposed quality requirements for different applications as low levels of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan are required for brewing and distilling and high levels for positive impacts on human health. RESULTS: We quantified grain (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan content in a collection of 399 2 -row Spring-type, and 204 2 -row Winter-type elite barley cultivars originating mainly from north western Europe. We combined these data with genotypic information derived using a 9 K Illumina iSelect SNP platform and subsequently carried out a Genome Wide Association Scan (GWAS). Statistical analysis accounting for residual genetic structure within the germplasm collection allowed us to identify significant associations between molecular markers and the phenotypic data. By anchoring the regions that contain these associations to the barley genome assembly we catalogued genes underlying the associations. Based on gene annotations and transcript abundance data we identified candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a region of the genome on chromosome 2 containing a cluster of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE (Csl) genes, including CslF 3, CslF 4, CslF 8, CslF 10, CslF 12 and CslH, as well as a region on chromosome 1 H containing CslF 9, are associated with the phenotype in this germplasm. We also observed that several regions identified by GWAS contain glycoside hydrolases that are possibly involved in (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan breakdown, together with other genes that might participate in (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan synthesis, re-modelling or regulation. This analysis provides new opportunities for understanding the genes related to the regulation of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-glucan content in cereal grains.

40|$|Four {{different}} grain {{cell wall}} staining techniques were compared. Two techniques specifically detected arabinoxylan (AX). The first technique used a xylanase probe, {{while the other}} one was based on immunolabeling of AX using monoclonal antibodies. The two other staining techniques, one based on Calcofluor and the other on immunolabeling using monoclonal antibodies, stained mixed-linkage b-glucan. Cell <b>walls</b> of wheat, <b>barley,</b> oat and rye grains, differing both in content and location of AX and b-glucan, were examined. The staining methods were complementary to each other in revealing the location and distribution of the major cereal dietary fiber components AX and b-glucan in the different grains. AX was mostly concentrated in nucellar epidermis and aleurone cells, whereas b-glucan was concentrated more in subaleurone cells. Furthermore, in the case of barley and rye, the endosperm cell walls also contained high amounts of b-glucan. Interestingly, b-glucan in rye and <b>barley</b> endosperm cell <b>walls</b> was located adjacent to the cell contents, suggesting that it is not evenly distributed in the endosperm cell walls.

40|$|Grains, all {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} the grasses or Graminaceae, typically have hemicellulose type cell walls which are rich in arabinoxylans (AX) and mixed-linkage β-glucan. However, different grain types and tissues are known to differ strongly in the relative amounts of AX and β-glucan in their cell walls. In this study, the location of AX and β-glucan in cell <b>walls</b> of wheat, <b>barley,</b> oat and rye was investigated by microscopic analysis. AX and β-glucan were stained with different techniques, i. e. AX staining with a fluorescently labeled xylanase probe, β-glucan staining with Calcofluor and immunolabeling using monoclonal antibodies against AX or β-glucan. The staining methods were complementary to each other in revealing the location and distribution of the major cereal dietary fiber components in the different grains.

40|$|Recent structure-function {{analysis}} of heterologously expressed K+-selective inward-rectifying channels (KIRCs) from plants {{has revealed that}} external protons can have opposite effects on different {{members of the same}} gene family. An important question is how the diverse response of KIRCs to apoplastic pH is reflected at the tissue level. Activation of KIRCs by acid external pH is well documented for guard cells, but no other tissue has yet been studied. In this paper we present, {{for the first time to}} our knowledge, in planta characterization of the effects of apoplastic pH on KIRCs in roots. Patch-clamp experiments on protoplasts derived from barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots showed that a decrease in external pH shifted the half-activation potential to more positive voltages and increased the limit conductance. The resulting enhancement of the KIRC current, together with the characteristic voltage dependence, strongly relates the KIRC of barley root cells to AKT 1 -type as opposed to AKT 3 -type channels. Measurements of cell <b>wall</b> pH in <b>barley</b> roots with fluorescent dye revealed a bulk apoplastic pH close to the pK values of KIRC activation and significant acidification of the apoplast after the addition of fusicoccin. These results indicate that channel-mediated K+ uptake may be linked to development, growth, and stress responses of root cells via the activity of H+-translocating systems...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have the}} {{potential}} to accumulate toxic amounts of cadmium (Cd), and understanding how and where Cd is stored in plants is important for ensuring food safety. Previous experiments have determined that a greater amount of Cd is translocated into the leaves of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) as compared to barley leaves (Hordeum vulgare). Preferential retention of Cd in root of barley would explain this difference. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the localization and coordination environment of Cd (i. e., the ligands to which Cd was bound) in the different root tissues of lettuce and barley using histochemical staining, electron microscopy and micro X-ray spectroscopy. Retention of Cd in barley roots could be explained by accumulation of Cd at the endodermis, comparatively higher amounts of Cd sequestered in the symplast of cortical cells and binding to xylem cell walls. Increased translocation of Cd to lettuce shoots seemed to be due to a less effective barrier at the endodermis and less sequestration of Cd in the cortex. Regardless of the tissue type, most of the Cd 2 + was bound to S ligands in the roots of barley, possibly reflecting accumulation of Cd–phytochelatin and Cd–S molecules in the vacuoles. In lettuce roots, Cd was more evenly distributed among ligands containing S, O and NO 3 groups, which is indicative of proportionately more Cd binding to the cell <b>walls,</b> relative to <b>barley.</b> These results will be useful in uncovering the mechanisms of differential Cd-tolerance and sequestration in lettuce and barley...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} work (E. Shedletzky, M. Shmuel, D. P. Delmer, D. T. A. Lamport [1990] Plant Physiol 94 : 980 - 987) showed that suspension-cultured tomato cells adapted to growth on the cellulose synthesis inhibitor 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB) have a markedly altered cell wall composition, most notably a markedly reduced {{level of the}} cellulose-xyloglucan network. This study compares the adaptation to DCB of two cell lines from dicots (tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum] and tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum]) and a Graminaceous monocot (barley [Hordeum bulbosum] endosperm). The difference in wall structures between the dicots and the monocot {{is reflected in the}} very different types of wall modifications induced by growth on DCB. The dicots, having reduced levels of cellulose and xyloglucan, possess walls the major integrity of which is provided by Ca 2 +-bridged pectates because protoplasts can be prepared from these cells simply by treatment with divalent cation chelator and a purified endopolygalacturonase. The tensile strength of these walls is considerably less than walls from nonadapted cells, but wall porosity is not altered. In contrast, <b>walls</b> from adapted <b>barley</b> cells contain very little pectic material and normal to elevated levels of noncellulosic polysaccharides compared with walls from nonadapted cells. Surprisingly, they have tensile strengths higher than their nonadapted counterpart, although cellulose levels are reduced by 70 %. Evidence is presented that these walls obtain their additional strength by an altered pattern of cross-linking of polymers involving phenolic components. Such cross-linking may also explain the observation that the porosity of these walls is also considerably reduced. Cells of adapted lines of both the dicots and barley are resistant to plasmolysis, suggesting that they possess very strong connections between the wall and the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|Immunolabeling, {{combined}} with chemical analyses and transcript profiling, {{have provided a}} comprehensive temporal and spatial picture of the deposition and modification of cell <b>wall</b> polysaccharides during <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare) grain development, from endosperm cellularization at 3 d after pollination (DAP) through differentiation to the mature grain at 38 DAP. (1 → 3) -β-D-Glucan appears transiently during cellularization but reappears in patches in the subaleurone cell walls around 20 DAP. (1 → 3, 1 → 4) -β-Glucan, the most abundant polysaccharide of the mature barley grain, accumulates throughout development. Arabino-(1 - 4) -β-D-xylan is deposited significantly earlier than we previously reported. This was attributable to the initial deposition of the polysaccharide in a highly substituted form that was not recognized by antibodies commonly used to detect arabino-(1 - 4) -β-D-xylans in sections of plant material. The epitopes needed for antibody recognition were exposed by pretreatment of sections with a-L-arabinofuranosidase; this procedure showed that arabino-(1 - 4) -β-D-xylans were deposited as early as 5 DAP and highlighted their changing structures during endosperm development. By 28 DAP labeling of hetero-(1 → 4) -β-D-mannan is observed in {{the walls of the}} starchy endosperm but not in the aleurone walls. Although absent in mature endosperm cell walls we now show that xyloglucan is present transiently from 3 until about 6 DAP and disappears by 8 DAP. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of transcripts for GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE, Cellulose Synthase, and CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE genes were consistent with the patterns of polysaccharide deposition. Transcript profiling of some members from the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database glycosyl transferase families GT 61, GT 47, and GT 43, previously implicated in arabino-(1 - 4) -β-D-xylan biosynthesis, confirms their presence during grain development.

40|$|Complex cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> hulls contain {{phenolic}} constituents — hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly {{ferulic acid}} (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxy-cinnamic acid, FA) and para-coumaric acid (4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, PCA). Ferulic acid is produced via the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and is covalently cross-linked to polysaccharides by ester bonds and to components of lignin mainly by ether bonds. Various studies have consistently indicated that FA {{is among the}} factors most inhibitory to the biodegradability of plant cell wall polysaccharides. PCA is also covalently linked to polysaccharides (minor) and lignin (major), but PCA does not form the inhibitory cross-linkages as FA does. It is considered to represent plant cell wall lignification. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the genotypic variation and magnitude of difference in the concentration of the hydroxycinnamic acids in terms of FA and PCA as well as their ratios in barley hull and seeds in sixteen varieties of barley collected during three years. These data will be correlated to barley nutrient availability in future study. The barley varieties included CDC Cowboy, Valier, TR 251, Newdale, RCSL 97, KXN/TLN- 147 (AU), WABAR 2160 (AU), Harrington, CDC Copeland, CDC Kendall, AC Metcalfe, CDC Dolly, McLeod, CDC Bold, CDC Helgason and CDC Trey. The focus of this study was on ferulic acid because of its inhibitory effect on rumen degradation and digestion which are highly related to nutrient availability in animals. The results showed significant differences (P < 0. 01) a mong the barley varieties in ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid and their ratio. Whole barley seed contained higher (P< 0. 05) ferulic acid concentration than p-coumaric acid, ranging from 509 to 679 μg/g DM for ferulic acid and 131 to 345 μg/g DM for p-coumaric acid. The ratios of ferulic acid to p-coumaric acid ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 9. The ferulic acid concentration in hull was higher (P < 0. 05) than that in whole seed, ranging from 2, 320 to 4, 206 μg/g DM. Percentage of ferulic acid content in hull and dehulled seed ranged from 38 to 70 % and 30 to 62 %, respectively. Growth year affect affected the hydroxycinnamic acid profiles in barley seed and hull. In conclusion, there were large differences in the ferulic acid and para-coumaric acid among the barley varieties indicating genotypic variation. Harrington contained highest and Valier contained lowest FA in whole seed. Barley TR 251 contained lowest % of FA content in the hull and highest % of FA content in the dehulled seed. Future study is needed to understand the relationship between the hydroxycinnamic acid profile in barley seeds and hull and nutrient utilization and availability of barley in animals...|$|R
40|$|Barley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cereals cultivated in the Nordic countries. Climate change brings warmer and moisture climate which favors fungal diseases. In the cropland barley can be seriously infested with hard fungus attack. Since it is important that the yield bears a high quality it is of great importance to find varieties more resistant to attacks. Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are stress proteins induced in the plant in response to infection and abiotic stress (van Loon, 1997). PRs are shown to have antimicrobial activity differing between bacteria, fungi and oomycetes (Tandrup Poulsen, 2001). Among the 17 PR-families (van Loon et al., 1994, 2006) PR- 5 {{is one of the}} most abundant ones in barley (Tandrup Poulsen, 2001, van Loon et al., 2006). Studies have shown that PR- 5 exists naturally in the ground tissue of leaves, but not in the epidermis (Gregersen et al., 1997). In the epidermal cell walls an epidermis-specific promoter for PR- 5 has been placed in front of the gene encoding PR- 5, this to achieve a more resistant cultivar of barley. Enhanced resistance has been demonstrated, but it is not confirmed that this resistance is due to expression of PR- 5 in epidermis (Santén et al., unpublished, Tandrup Poulsen, 2001). In the modified lines, preliminary studies have shown irregular structure of epidermis (Santén et al., unpublished). The aim of the study was to establish whether there were structural differences between regular and modified barley, and to localize PR- 5 in epidermis. Counterstaining was used to be able to study the leaf structure in microscope, and immunocytochemistry was used to localize PR- 5. Results showed irregular cell structure in epidermis, and in a few cases even in the ground tissue, of modified barley. Due to failure in method, unspecific binding of the antibody visualizer occurred and no confident result could be established regarding the localization of PR- 5. Nothing indicates an existence of PR- 5 in epidermal cell <b>walls</b> of modified <b>barley.</b> This could be a result of a non-working method, undetectable levels of PR- 5 or that the gene encoding PR- 5 is expressed as mRNA but not translated to protein. Occurrence of PR- 5 has been demonstrated in epidermal cells of infected material. This detection could be due to the fact that the gene needs an infection to be 6 expressed as the protein. More studies are necessary to establish whether the showed enhanced resistance is due to expression of PR- 5 in epidermis...|$|R
40|$|Non-starch polysaccharides, such as beta-glucans and arabinoxylans, {{present in}} the cell <b>walls</b> of <b>barley</b> grains, are {{important}} contributors to wort filtration problems due to their viscous nature. Since nowadays it is the current practice to produce well-modified malts in the malting plant, the role of beta-glucans in reduced filtration rate is of minor importance because of their advanced degradation during malting. Conversely, {{a lot of the}} filtration problems to date are associated with arabinoxylans which are not extensively degraded during malting, as the endogenous enzymes that hydrolyse arabinoxylans, i. e. xylanases, are produced relatively late in the germination process. Furthermore, because of the relatively low temperature stability of endogenous xylanases, arabinoxylans are insufficiently degraded during the brewing process. In addition, it is well-known that a substantial part of the malt xylanolytic activity originates from the microbial community present on the barley kernels, representing a second metabolically active compound in the malting ecosystem. Against this background, this doctoral study aimed to generate insights into the xylanase-producing bacterial community present during barley malting. Special emphasis was put on the bacterial glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 xylanases, since they degrade arabinoxylans very effectively and are resistant to xylanase inhibitors present in barley. As traditional culture-dependent approaches are known to underestimate the microbial species diversity, molecular culture-independent 454 amplicon pyrosequencing was successfully applied to investigate the structure and dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with industrial malting. The bacterial community structure in the malting ecosystem was found to be complex and community dynamics appeared to differ from year to year and to be influenced by the malting process steps. Although many bacteria were found to occur from the harvested barley kernel up {{to the end of the}} malting process, the observed differences between two harvest years could not be explained by a different microbial load initially present on the barley kernels. Environmental parameters such as varying seasonal weather conditions and, as a consequence of this, adjustments of the air circulation pattern in the maltings, could potentially explain the differences in bacterial community structure of germinated barley and kilned malt samples between both investigated years. The bacterial community structure was also found to change along the malting process, but eventually the kilned malt samples were more similar to their corresponding harvested barley sample than to the germinating barley samples. Also at the phylum level, clear differences could be observed between both harvest and malting years. In order to explore the arabinoxylan-degrading microbial community present during barley malting, the genetic diversity and distribution of GH 10 xylanase genes during malting were examined using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. Most of the GH 10 xylanases detected in the malting barley samples showed a high identity with known xylanases. The GH 10 xylanase sequences obtained in this study were mainly related to xylanases from the phylum Bacteroidetes, in particular from the genus Sphingobacterium. The second part of this study focuses on the availability of xylanolytic bacteria and their exploitation during malting. Therefore, the diversity of the arabinoxylan-degrading bacterial community during barley malting was assessed by microbial isolation, cultivation on different media enriched with arabinoxylan, and identification. As such, 33 species-level operational taxonomic units belonging to 25 genera were found. Most of the arabinoxylan-hydrolysing bacteria isolated during malting could be assigned to Sphingobacterium species. Genetic fingerprinting revealed shifts in S. multivorum populations during the process, especially during germination. Furthermore, the xylanase produced by an isolate showing the highest activity (identified as Cellulomonas flavigena) was partially purified and characterised with respect to temperature stability, revealing a relatively thermostable enzyme. A filtration assay which is relevant to current brewing practices, was successfully applied to study the lautering performance of kilned malts. Addition of commercially available, thermostable xylanases at mashing-in was highly efficient to increase the wort filtration rate, especially when GH 10 xylanases were applied. Besides direct application in mashing, the addition of exogenous GH 10 xylanase during barley germination also resulted in improved lautering performance. Furthermore, the addition of two xylanolytic bacteria (Cellulomonas flavigena or Enterococcus casseliflavus), originating from malting barley, into the steeping or germination process resulted in an increased wort filtration rate without negative effects on malting performance or on standard malt quality characteristics. This knowledge opens up new perspectives for the application of xylanolytic bacteria during steeping or germination on an industrial scale. In conclusion, this doctoral study contributes to the existing body of knowledge of bacterial diversity during malting and leads to a better understanding of the role of bacteria in the malting process. In particular, this study may provide a basis for microbiota management during malting, aiming at an increased mash filtration rate since introducing more xylanase activity in the malting/brewing process shows high potential in this respect. As improved wort filtration is linked to lower heat load and reduced production of aldehydes, it may ultimately also result in enhanced beer flavour quality, including flavour stability. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|R
