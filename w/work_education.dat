A ZEF study on telephone access in rural China shows that heads of farm households with a primary level of education were more likely to subscribe to telephones than those without any level of education.|$|E

25|$|The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (O.S.A.), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, {{they pray}} the Liturgy of the Hours {{throughout}} the day. This Latin Rite Order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic Orders in three ways: 1) They {{do not take}} vows of stability, meaning that they can live in one house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the Order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission <b>work,</b> <b>education,</b> prison ministries, etc. The Order is {{under the supervision of}} a Prior General in Rome, and as an international Order they are divided into various Provinces throughout the world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial; (3) As an Order, they have a special commitment to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated {{as it was in the}} origins of the Order, this is to be a distinguishing mark of their lives as a community.|$|E
25|$|With roots {{dating back}} to 1909 in the university's School of Social Economy, the George Warren Brown School of Social Work (commonly called GWB, the Brown School, or Brown) was founded in 1925. Brown's {{academic}} degree offerings include a Master of Social Work (MSW), a Master of Public Health (MPH), a PhD in Social Work, and a PhD in Public Health Sciences. It is currently ranked first among Master of Social Work programs in the United States.

The school {{was the first in}} the country to have a building for the purpose of social <b>work</b> <b>education,</b> and it is also {{a founding member of the}} Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health. The school is housed within Brown and Goldfarb Halls, but a third building expansion is currently in progress and slated to be completed in summer 2015. The new building, adjacent to Brown and Goldfarb Halls, targets LEED Gold certification and will add approximately 105,000 square feet, more than doubling the school's teaching, research, and program space.|$|E
