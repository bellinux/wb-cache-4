40|$|This paper {{describes}} several in-service {{applications for}} portable phased arrays. OmniScan is new category of instrument using ultrasonic phased arrays, {{as well as}} other technologies (conventional ultrasonics, TOFD, eddy current arrays etc.). Portable phased arrays can operate in manual, semi-automated (i. e. encoded) or fully automated modes, though most of the applications to date have been manual or semi-automated. Unlike conventional ultrasonics, portable phased arrays can provide many different displays, such as A-, B-, C-, D- and S-scans, plus combined displays which significantly help imaging. Most of the new applications so far have been specials, which take advantage of {{one or more of the}} following features: special scan patterns (e. g. S-scans), imaging (e. g. corrosion mapping or <b>weld</b> <b>inspections),</b> inspection speed, restricted space. Portable phased arrays also offer advanced reporting capability, including pre-prepared reports and automatic pasting of images into reports for archiving. Sample applications for portable phased arrays include: • Detection and sizing of SCC in turbine roots • Small diameter austenitic pipe <b>weld</b> <b>inspections</b> • In-service inspection of pipe for SCC • Butt <b>weld</b> <b>inspections</b> • T-weld inspections of bridge structures • HIC – Hydrogen Induced Cracking • Flange corrosion under gasket • Nozzle inspections • Thread inspections • Bridge bolt inspections • Spindle/shaft inspections • Landing gear <b>inspections</b> • Laser <b>weld</b> <b>inspections</b> • Composite...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic phased arrays {{are a new}} {{technology}} that offers considerable potential for inspecting construction welds. Using electronic control of the beam, phased arrays can scan, sweep, steer and focus the ultrasound. Since welds typically produce defects of known character and orientation, phased arrays can be programmed to optimize <b>weld</b> <b>inspections.</b> These inspections include standard ASME-type pulse echo raster scans, zone discrimination, TOFD and “specials”, depending on the vessel, weld profile, geometry and specifications. One advantage of phased arrays is inspection speed: linear travel speeds of up to 100 mm/sec are possible. Sizing is typically performed using diffraction approaches (TOFD and back diffraction), both well suited to phased arrays, {{as well as by}} pulse echo. Results can be obtained shortly after welding. Since phased arrays use preprogrammed set-ups, they are inherently flexible for many different weld and vessel configurations. Lastly, ultrasonics generates no safety hazards, so moving personnel or vessels is unnecessary. This presentation will describe how ultrasonic phased arrays work, what can be done with them, and gives examples of phased array inspection systems for pressure vessels. Examples of inspections on various vessels will include thick-sectioned welds inspected using both electronic raster scans and zone discrimination. Phased arrays are well suited to premium vessel inspections, which require multiple NDE techniques for Fitness-For-Purpose (Engineering Critical Assessment) inspections. Examples will be given of smaller portable phased array <b>weld</b> <b>inspections,</b> with code-compliant procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of fabrication and repair of structures in space {{must be met}} {{if we are to}} utilize and maintain long-duration space facilities. Welding techniques have been demonstrated to provide the most reliable means to accomplish this task. Over the past few years, methods have been developed to perform orbital tube welding employing space-based welding technology pioneered by the former Soviet Union. Welding can result in the formation of defects, which threaten the structural integrity of the welded joint. Implementation of welding on-orbit, therefore, must also include methods to evaluate the quality and integrity of the welded joints.

40|$|The {{interest}} for thermography {{as a method}} for spot <b>weld</b> <b>inspection</b> has increased during the last years since it is a full-field method suitable for automatic inspection. Thermography systems can be developed in different ways, with different physical setups, excitation sources, and image analysis algorithms. In this paper we suggest a single-sided setup of a thermography system using a flash lamp as excitation source. The analysis algorithm aims to find the spatial region in the acquired images corresponding to the successfully welded area, i. e., the nugget size. Experiments show {{that the system is}} able to detect spot welds, measure the nugget diameter, and based on the information also separate a spot weld from a stick weld. The system is capable to inspect more than four spot welds per minute, and has potential for an automatic non-destructive system for spot <b>weld</b> <b>inspection.</b> The development opportunities are significant, since the algorithm used in the initial analysis is rather simplified. Moreover, further evaluation of alternative excitation sources can potentially improve the performance. Funding Agencies|Vinnova (the FFI program) </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The TOFD {{technique}} is being {{widely used in}} automatic <b>weld</b> <b>inspection</b> to ensure welding quality. Although it reaches high speeds in the inspection, high sizing reliability and low rate of false indications, the classification of defects through ultrasound signals generated by the TOFD {{technique is}} still frequently questioned, because it depends mainly on the knowledge and experience of the operator. The use of computational tools for signal preprocessing and pattern recognition, such as the artificial neural networks, improves the classification reliability of defects detected by this technique. This study shows how to obtain the best hierarchical and non-hierarchical linear classifiers implemented by neural networks, in order to distinguish defects (lack of fusion, lack of penetration and porosity) inserted into the testing pieces during the welding process and detected by the TOFD technique. The position, type and dimension of each inserted defect are known by conventional ultrasonic and radiographic techniques. The Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform and Savitzky-Golay Filter were used to preprocessing signals acquired during <b>weld</b> <b>inspection</b> by TOFD technique.
