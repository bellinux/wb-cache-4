40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted into {{the effects of}} wear {{on the performance of}} common-rail fuel injectors, in terms of flow and spray characteristics. The investigation conducted involved the testing of four used injectors, and the comparison of the performance of these injectors with that of an identical brand new injector. The used injectors had deteriorated in different ways, with solenoid <b>wear,</b> mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the body of the injector, and mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the upper section of the injector being identified. All of the manners of deterioration affected the flow characteristics. The solenoid wear and mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the body did not affect the spray performance, but <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the upper section of the body and a combination of <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the body and solenoid did affect spray performance.

As {{one of the}} {{cost-effective}} machining {{methods for}} advanced ceramics, rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) has attracted much attention and there exist numerous publications on the process. However, few investigations on tool <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the RUM process have been reported. This paper, {{for the first time}} in literature, presents an experimental observation on tool <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> RUM of alumina. it presents and discusses the results on tool <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> RUM of alumina.

Results were summarized as follows; 1) The percentage of players wearing eyeglasses or contact lens in daily life was 50. 8 %, and contact lens <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the pool was 21. 5 % of all subjects. 2) The percentage of contact lens <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the pool among the players of daily correct visual functions, were 63 % in level A; 8 teams of high rank in Japan, and 27 % in level B; 8 teams of low rank (p 0. 01). 3) The kinds of contact lenses <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the pool were disposable (71. 1 %), hard type (18. 4 %) and soft contact lens (10. 5 %). 4) There were 66 % of players wearing the same contact lens at the daily use and in the pool, and there was a tendency toward higher corneal and conjunctival damage. We concluded that contact lens <b>wear</b> <b>in</b> the pool is important matter to complete the high performance at the water polo players with poor visual functions, and should be examined from the point of protecting the eye...|$|R

5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly <b>worn</b> <b>in</b> the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E
