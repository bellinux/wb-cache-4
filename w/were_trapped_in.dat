5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|In Saint Lucia, downpours {{triggered}} torrential flooding {{along the}} island's easternmost coast from October5 through October6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged. Several residences {{had to be}} evacuated, and some people <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> their homes. Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, and the inability to prepare meals due {{to the loss of}} kitchen equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well as an additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

5|$|As both battalions {{headed for}} the railway line, gliders {{carrying}} the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open ground when the gliders arrived. In the confusion, with both groups under fire, each thought {{the other was the}} enemy and began shooting back. The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away the majority of their guns <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the burning gliders. Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties {{at the hands of the}} defending KOSB companies. In the confusion, 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane.

5|$|De Montfort {{returned}} to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford {{to pursue a}} renewed anti-Poitevin agenda. Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and, by October, England faced a likely civil war between Henry, backed by Edward, Bigod and the conservative barons, and de Montfort, de Clare and the radicals. De Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt. Henry and Eleanor <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the Tower of London by the rebels; the Queen attempted to escape up the River Thames to join Edward's army at Windsor, but was forced to retreat by the London crowds. De Montfort took the pair prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.|$|E

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as thousands of people <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, {{and a number of}} these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|Germany and Europe {{as a whole}} {{was almost}} totally {{dependent}} on foreign oil imports. In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E
5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E

5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant {{floor manager}} and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Skip brought {{widespread}} {{impact to}} much of the already battered country. On Cebu island, almost 20,000people <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> floodwaters. Along the slope of the Mayon Volcano, 2,600people had to be evacuated due to a landslide. On the remote island of Palawan, 74people were killed. Elsewhere, most towns in the Capiz province on Panay Island were flooded. Two people were killed and more than 700people were evacuated from the Aklan province. In the Iloilo province, on the eastern portion of Panay Island, almost 40villages were under water and nearby roads were impassable. Seventeen homes were demolished, and two people were confirmed to have been killed because of a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur. Throughout the city, ten people perished. Throughout the province, up to 27people died and at least 20others were hurt. In the suburbs of Manila, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs, but city proper itself avoided the worst impact from Skip. Overall, 237people were killed {{as a result of the}} typhoon while 35other people were injured. Throughout the country, damaged totaled $131.8million (1988USD).|$|E
5|$|Born in Frankfurt, Germany, {{she lived}} {{most of her}} life in or near Amsterdam, Netherlands, having moved there with her family at the age of four and {{one-half}} when the Nazis gained control over Germany. Born a German national, Frank lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless. By May 1940, the Franks <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the family went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father worked. From then until the family's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944, Anne kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to concentration camps. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, Margot, were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (probably of typhus) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the Anne Frank House in 2015 suggests they more likely died in February.|$|E

5|$|Two weeks later, Sultan Bayezid {{arrived with}} a large army {{to the south of}} the town and took up a strong {{defensive}} position, challenging the crusaders to meet him. The crusader army moved to confront him on 24 September, but poor discipline and fractured leadership between the national factions resulted in a premature assault by the French force against the bluffs controlled by Ottoman troops. With the allied army strung out, Bayezid marshaled his reserves and defeated the crusaders in a furious engagement in which fell most of the allied army. Thousands more were captured and executed after the battle by the victorious Turkish troops. The exact fate of Sir Jean de Carrouges {{in the midst of this}} melee is unknown but it is probable that he fell close to his commander Jean de Vienne, whose forces <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> a gully and decimated by Turkish cavalry. Following his death, his estates passed to his ten-year-old son Robert and a mural of Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges was painted in the Abbey of St. Etienne in Caen to celebrate his memory.
