Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light.

5|$|Rowling has {{expanded}} the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch Through the Ages (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds {{from the sale}} of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned {{to raise money for the}} Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding <b>world</b> <b>not</b> included in the original novels.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of the singularity {{of the world and}} the reality of time establishes history as the site of decisive action through the propositions that there is only one real <b>world,</b> <b>not</b> multiple or simultaneous universes, and that time really exists in the <b>world,</b> <b>not</b> as a simulacrum through which we must experience the world.|$|E

While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e).
