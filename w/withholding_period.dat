50|$|The MRL {{is usually}} {{determined}} by repeated (on {{the order of}} 10) field trials, where the crop has been treated according to good agricultural practice (GAP) and an appropriate pre harvest interval or <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> has elapsed. For many pesticides this is set at the Limit of Determination (LOD) - since only major pesticides have been evaluated and understanding of Acceptable daily intake (ADI) is incomplete (i.e. producers or public bodies have not submitted MRL data - often because these were not required in the past). LOD {{can be considered a}} measure of presence/absence, but certain residues may not be quantifiable at very low levels. For this reason the limit of quantification (LOQ) is often used instead of the LOD. As a rule of thumb the LOQ is approximately two times the LOD. For substances that are not included in any of the annexes in EU regulations, a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg normally applies.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{achieve an}} {{accurate}} phenotyping for drought tolerance, {{it is important}} to control water stress levels and timing. This study aimed to determine water use by upland rice plants during <b>periods</b> of irrigation <b>withholding</b> and its relationship with grain yield in order to increase the efficiency of this phenotyping. Two experiments were carried out in a randomized block design in which six water treatments (irrigation <b>withholding</b> for <b>periods</b> of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days) were compared, with four replicates. In the first experiment, treatments were applied at the R 3 stage (panicle exsertion) and, in the second, at the R 5 stage (beginning of grain filling). The amount of water evapotranspired was determined by the difference between the soil water storage at the beginning {{and at the end of}} irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>periods,</b> from the surface to 80 -cm depth. Evapotranspiration of upland rice from R 3 stage was higher compared to that observed from R 5 stage, when subjected to similar irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> in both growth stages. Rice grain yield is more sensitive to irrigation withholding imposed from R 5 stage than from R 3 stage...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{microbial}} {{risk assessment}} models for estimating the annual risk of enteric virus infection associated with consuming raw vegetables {{that have been}} overhead irrigated with nondisinfected secondary treated reclaimed water were constructed. We ran models for several different scenarios of crop type, viral concentration in effluent, and time since last irrigation event. The mean annual risk of infection was always less for cucumber than for broccoli, cabbage, or lettuce. Across the various crops, effluent qualities, and viral decay rates considered, the annual risk of infection ranged from 10 � 3 to 10 � 1 when reclaimed-water irrigation ceased 1 day before harvest and from 10 � 9 to 10 � 3 when it ceased 2 weeks before harvest. Two previously published decay coefficients were {{used to describe the}} die-off of viruses in the environment. For all combinations of crop type and effluent quality, application of the more aggressive decay coefficient led to annual risks of infection that satisfied the commonly propounded benchmark of < 10 � 4, i. e., one infection or less per 10, 000 people per year, providing that 14 days had elapsed since irrigation with reclaimed water. Conversely, this benchmark was not attained for any combination of crop and water quality when this <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> was 1 day. The lower decay rate conferred markedly less protection, with broccoli and cucumber being the only crops satisfying the 10 � 4 standard for all water qualities after a 14 -day <b>withholding</b> <b>period.</b> Sensitivity analyses on the models revealed that in nearly all cases, variation in the amount of produce consumed had the most significant effec...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} ectoparasiticides are used on sheep {{to protect the}} animals from ill health {{associated}} with infestations of lice {{and the effects of}} fly-strike. Most of the compounds currently in use are organophosphate or pyrethroid-based and have been used for 15 - 20 years, or more. In more recent times, as with other pest control strategies, there has been a tendency to introduce 'newer' pesticides, principally in the form of insect growth regulators (IGRs). Vetrazin® was the first IGR-based compound to be registered for use as an ectoparasiticide in Australia and New Zealand. The active ingredient of Vetrazin® is cyromazine, a triazine-based compound. Prior to the introduction of Vetrazin®, and indeed more recently with other 'new' pesticides, little was, or is known regarding the fate of these compounds during woolscouring. Additionally, given the present practice for woolscours to discharge their aqueous effluents to the aquatic environment, little was, or is known regarding their effects on these receiving waters. In addition, cyromazine is a chemically 'unique' compound, apparently possessing chemical and environmental stability, as well as being highly polar. This uniqueness required the development of specialised techniques for its analysis. Its environmental stability and polarity also suggested that it could become a significant aquatic contaminant, certainly in localised situations. This thesis outlines the development of a clean-up method for the analysis of cyromazine residues in woolscouring waste waters and on greasy (shorn) and scoured wool. A clean-up method using Extract-Clean™ ion-exchange cartridges and analysis by both gas chromatography with nitorgenphosphorus detector (GC/NPD) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is described. The fate of cyromazine residues during the scouring of greasy wool was investigated by both laboratory and industrial pilot plant trials. Cyromazine was shown to be readily removed in the first three scouring bowls of a woolscour. A simple model is described {{that can be used to}} predict cyromazine effluent concentrations based on a known content for greasy wool. These effluent concentrations can then be used to assess compliance with a proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) established for cyromazine, based on aquatic bioassays. Aquatic bioassays were conducted with both Chironomus zealandicus (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae and eggs and Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) nymphs. Cyromazine possessed negligible acute toxicity to both organisms, with the concentration required for 50 % mortality (LC 50) being greater than 100 mg/l. However, significant chronic toxicity to C. zealandicus was observed, with a lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 25 µg/l being recorded. A proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) value of 1. 0 µg/l has been suggested, a figure supported by limited aquatic toxicity studies performed elsewhere. Cyromazine was shown to dominate approximately 30 % of the fly-strike control market in New Zealand. This high usage, plus a moderate EQS value, suggests that a minimum seven week <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> be instigated between dipping for fly-strike control and shearing of treated sheep. Limited toxicity testing was carried out on another IGR-based ectoparasiticide, Zenith®, containing diflubenzuron. This testing, combined with published aquatic toxicity data, suggests than an EQS value for this compound be set at 0. 01 µg/l and a <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> for dipped sheep be set at 18 weeks. Such a long <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> is unlikely to be attainable in practice such that, if highly aquatically toxic compounds are going to be used as ectoparasiticides on sheep, then woolscours are going to have to invest in technology to remove pesticides from their effluents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the work done in WP 3 including definitions of normal and abnormal milk, suggestions for reference methods, and tests of AMS models according to these requirements. The general conditions of hygiene in milk production in the EU are defined by the Commission Directive 89 / 362 /EEC (1989) but not all elements apply to automatic milking. The following text is proposed {{to be included in the}} coming EU Hygiene Directive: Milking must be carried out hygienically ensuring in particular:- that milk from an animal is checked for abnormalities by the milker or a method achieving similar results and that only normal milk is used for human consumption and that abnormal, milk with a <b>withholding</b> <b>period,</b> and undesirable milk are excluded. The definition of abnormal milk caused by clinical mastitis is proposed to be based on the homogeneity of the milk and not on the colour since the colour of the milk changes with breed, stage of lactation, feedstuffs etc. The reference method is suggested as filtration of the milk through a filter with a pore size of 0. 1 mm, and milk where clots are clearly visible in such a filter is then defined as being abnormal...|$|E

25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with {{improper}} application and heavy reliance throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. Jetting, dipping, and backlining are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that the efficiency of a finishing period can be improved by reducing the initial fat content of fish fillets, by means of a period of food deprivation. Two groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were fed for an 18 -week grow-out period on a vegetable oil-based diet (VO) or a fish oil-based diet (FO). VO fed fish were then split into two sub groups: one (VO/FO) was shifted to the FO diet for 8 weeks, whilst the other (UF/FO) was deprived of food (unfed) for 2 weeks and then fed the FO diet for the remaining 6 weeks. The control treatment (FO/FO) was represented by fish continuously fed FO. The subsequent reduction of total fat in the UF/FO treatment was then responsible for a much faster recovery towards a FO-like fatty acid profile, validating the proposed hypothesis. However, the modification of the fatty acid composition of fish fillets during the feed <b>withholding</b> <b>period,</b> coupled with the postponement of the finishing diet, resulted in only minor beneficial effects of this strategy, and the loss of potential weight gain.

The withdrawal time is the time required for the residue of toxicological concern to reach safe concentration as defined by tolerance.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the efficacy of three most common screening tests for Beta lactam residues in cow’s milk in our country. The tests used in the study are SNAP β Lactam test (Idexx), Rosa Charm β Lactam test and Inhibition MRL test. Study samples included: standardized concentrations of penicillin solution (0, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ppb). In addition we tested milk samples from three equal size study groups (not receiving any antibiotic therapy, treated with Beta lactams for mastitis and treated with Beta lactams for diseases other than mastitis). Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each test, using standard penicillin concentrations with threshold value set at concentration of 4 ppb (Maximum residue level – MLR). Additionally we determined proportions of presumably false negative and false positive results for each test using results of filed samples testing. Agreement of test results for each test pair was assessed through Kappa coefficients interpreted by Landis-Koch scale. Detection level of all tests was shown to be well below MRL. This alongside with effects of natural inhibitors in milk contributed to finding of positive results in untreated and treated animals after the <b>withholding</b> <b>period.</b> Screening tests for beta lactam residues are important tools for ensuring that milk for human consumption is free from antibiotics residues. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of 1080 in two commonly used fox baits, Foxoff ® and chicken wingettes, was assessed under different climatic and rainfall conditions in central-western New South Wales. The rate of 1080 degradation {{did not change}} significantly between the Central Tablelands and the relatively hotter and drier environment of the Western Slopes. Loss of 1080 from wingettes was independent of the rainfall and climate conditions, with wingettes remaining lethal to foxes for, on average, 0. 9 weeks. Foxoff ® baits remained lethal for longer than wingettes under all tested conditions, although their rate of degradation increased generally with increasing rainfall. As a result, areas baited with Foxoff® will require longer <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> for working dogs than those baited with wingettes, especially during dry periods. Wingettes may have advantages for use in sensitive areas where long-term hazards from toxic baits are undesirable. We found significant variations in 1080 concentration in freshly prepared baits that may result in efficacy, non-target and regulatory concerns for baiting campaigns. As a result, the superior quality control and shelf-stability of manufactured Foxoff® may be important criteria for favouring its use over freshly prepared bait types. However, use strategies for any bait type must ensure that foxes consume lethal doses of 1080 to avoid potential problems such as the development of learned aversion to baits or pesticide resistance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{associate}} the short-term {{effects of the}} Handmaster orthosis on disabling symptoms of the affected upper extremity with long-term Handmaster orthosis use after stroke. DESIGN: Historic cohort study. PATIENTS: Patients with chronic stroke. METHODS: The Modified Ashworth Scale (0 - 5) for wrist (primary outcome) and elbow flexor hypertonia, visual analogue scale (0 - 10) for pain, oedema score (0 - 3), and passive range of wrist flexion and extension (pROM, degrees) were assessed prior to Handmaster orthosis prescription (T 0), after 6 weeks try-out (T 1) and a subsequent 4 weeks <b>withhold</b> <b>period</b> (T 2). Long-term use was evaluated using a questionnaire. Non-parametric analyses and predictive values were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Of the 110 included patients 78. 2 % were long-term Handmaster orthosis users. Long-term users showed significant short-term (T 0 -T 1) improvements on all impairment scores and a significant relapse of wrist and elbow Modified Ashworth Scale (T 1 -T 2). Non-users showed significant short-term effects on elbow Modified Ashworth Scale and visual analogue scale only. Positive predictive values of short-term effects for long-term use varied between 75 % and 100 %, with 85 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 72 - 0. 93) for wrist Modified Ashworth Scale. Negative predictive values were low (11 - 27 %). CONCLUSION: Short-term Handmaster orthosis effects were generally beneficial for hypertonia, pain, oedema, and pROM, especially in long-term users.

The green spray programme relied on applications of the organically-acceptable insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) (Delfin) while the conventional programme included broad-spectrum organophosphates (Lorsban and Attack). Fruit from blocks which received Bt sprays had slightly higher levels of leafroller and thrips damage, however the levels of damaged fruit from blocks receiving either spray programme were economically acceptable. After two seasons of comparisons, the grower decided to convert the entire orchard to a Bt based spray programme. Using information about the most important leafroller damage period, and the likely persistence of Bt, an experimental organic spray programme was developed. The effectiveness of this experimental spray programme was tested on two orchards in Te Puke. The organic programme relied on Bt applications concentrated over the critical time for leafroller control (flowering to March).

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} frequency on leaf physiomorphological processes of rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium capitatum×P. radens cv. Rose) {{was investigated in}} a glasshouse study at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, from November 2005 to October 2006. Daily, and every 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, and 5 th day irrigation were applied as treatments. Leaf samples for electron-microscopic observations were taken one week prior to harvesting, whereafter all plants were re-watered. For each of the irrigation frequency treatments, 50 % of the plants were then exposed to a one-week irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> (brief stress treatment) prior to harvesting. During this period, physiological properties were recorded {{on a daily basis}} to identify or monitor change. Higher irrigation frequency and a brief water stress period increased essential oil yield. Lower irrigation frequency tended to increase the citronellol to geraniol (C:G) ratio to unacceptably high levels (C:G> 3). Upon re-watering, stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Rt) were significantly lower for the lower irrigation frequency treatments, compared to the higher irrigation frequency treatments, while no noticeable differences were observed in water potential (ψw) and relative water content (RWC). At the end of the one-week stress period, Gs, Rt, ψw and RWC were lower for the plants that were more frequently irrigated compared to the less frequently irrigated treatments. Water stress reduced leaf size, and apparently increased trichome density, whereas the total number of trichomes per leaf remained more or less the same, indicating that total essential oil yield is mainly affected by leaf number (and not by leaf size or trichome number). Stomatal closure was the main water stress avoiding/adaptation mechanism. These results demonstrate that rose-scented geranium plants can make physiomorphological adaptations to save water. However, such a water saving strategy was counter-productive, since it resulted in lower essential oil yield and lower water-use efficiency...|$|E

Limited information {{is available on the}} potential impact of milking frequencies associated with Automatic Milking (AM) on excretion of veterinary drugs in milk. Under experimental conditions the excretion {{of antibiotic}}s in milk was studied in healthy cows (somatic cell count in composite milk below 100 000 /ml) after in-tramammary treatment with 4 different commercially available drugs at milking frequencies of 3, 2 and 1. 5 times per day. The concentrations of antibiotic residues in cow composite milk sampled at every milking time were determined by HPLC meth-ods and compared to the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) for each compound. For drugs containing cefquinome or penicillin or a combination of penicillin, nafcillin and dihydrostreptomycin significantly (p< 0. 05) shorter excretion periods were ob-served in cows milked 3 times per day compared to cows milked 1. 5 times per day. For one drug containing ampicillin and colistin differences were not significant. Higher concentrations of residues in milk were determined with shorter intervals between treatment and next milking. After intramammary treatment of clinical mastitis with cefquinome no significant dif-ference of excretion times was detected between cows milked 2 times (n= 15) or 1. 5 times (n= 4) per day.

40|$|A {{research}} project was undertaken {{to study the}} effect of biosolids on the decay times of enteric pathogens in the soil. This is the most comprehensive study in Australia where the persistence of enteric microorganisms in land-applied biosolids, particularly on broadacre grain farms in Australia, has been studied. Enteric pathogens such as faecal bacteria and viruses are present in biosolids, and when applied to land, these disease-causing microorganisms {{are at risk of}} being transmitted to humans following contact. The main aim of this {{research project}} was to examine the decay times of Escherichia coli (an indicator of enteric bacterial pathogens), Salmonella enterica (a representative of human pathogenic bacteria), bacteriophage MS 2 (surrogate virus) and adenovirus (a representative human pathogenic virus). Agricultural soil from two farming properties in Western Australia and South Australia was selected for testing the inactivation of these enteric microorganisms over the growing season of a cereal crop. To do this, soil, biosolids and human enteric microroganisms were inoculated into sentinel chambers and inserted into the soil in the field. Chambers were sampled at regular intervals across the duration of the experiment and pathogen numbers were plotted over time. The decay times (T 90) were then calculated based on the slope of decay to determine the estimated time for a one-log 10 removal to occur. The key findings from the soil (field) experiments were that a) very low numbers of bacteria and bacteriophage (MS 2) were detectable in the soil by harvest time since the microorganisms decayed rapidly over the growing season of the crop and b) that the decay times for E. coli, S. enterica and MS 2 were shorter in the biosolids-amended soil compared with the unamended soil. Results indicated that the application of biosolids to the soil may have actually increased the inactivation processes of the enteric microorganisms in the soil. Further findings were that enteric microorganism numbers, particularly bacteria, were significantly correlated with the changes in soil moisture and bacteriophage MS 2 was significantly correlated with changes in soil temperature. For industry, this means that while the application of biosolids may introduce harmful pathogens to the field, the pathogens (in biosolids-amended soils) are adequately reduced over time. In addition, the climatic conditions as typical for Australia with dry hot summers, generally do not favour the survival of enteric pathogens. A glasshouse experiment was conducted to validate the methodology for the quantification and enumeration of enteric microorganisms from soil and biosolids-amended soil. The resulting methods were a combination of procedures and processes from several sources that proved successful to improve the recovery of microorganisms from manure, biosolids or soil samples. The data from this experiment highlighted the difficulty faced when fitting a linear line of regression to the observed data points in order to calculate the time taken for the reduction of microorgainsms or the decay times (T 90 values) from the reciprocal of the slope. Because of this, statistical models that take curvature into account with more terms such as quadratic and cubic were examined. The quadratic model was observed to provide the best fit, therefore was considered the most suitable for use for the field (soil) data. A phyllosphere experiment was conducted to determine the decay times of enteric microorganisms on the leaves, spikelets (grain heads) and grains of wheat. This was important where fodder crops are grown for livestock feed in biosolids-amended paddocks. The concern was that pathogenic contaminants would transfer from the soil to the plant and be of risk at consumption. A key finding from the present study was that enteric microorganisms were detectable for longer in the soil (6 to 7 months) than the plant leaves (less than 1 month) therefore enteric pathogens on plant leaves would be of most risk to livestock where crops such as hay or lucerne are grown. Where <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> are maintained the risk of pathogen ingestion was considered to be low. Given favourable weather conditions for hay and silage production, the time from cutting to baling is approximately 1 week and because of this, the risks to livestock from pathogens is also considered low. Although the bacteria and virus examined in this research survived for several months on wheat grains (i. e. the time for a one-log 10 removal (T 90) for bacteria on stored grains was 9 to 12 d), the risks to humans was considered to be low {{based on the assumption that}} grains are often milled, ground and baked prior to consumption. Thresher and dust studies were conducted to compare indigenous bacterial levels at sites where biosolids had been applied, with sites where no biosolids had been applied. A key finding was that indigenous heterotrophic bacteria and enterococci numbers were higher at the biosolids-amended harvesting site than the unamended site. In addition, the highest numbers of bacteria (and inoculated microorganisms) was found on the chaff, indicating that this region could be sampled for the testing of any pathogenic microorganisms potentially present in dust samples. Results demonstrated that the process of threshing significantly reduced microorganism numbers on matured wheat plants. For industry this means that the risk of transferring human enteric pathgoens (bioaerosols) to humans at harvest time is low where crops have been previously applied with biosolids (particularly if field workers remain inside vehicles in sealed cabs of harvesters, trucks and utes or use dust protection while the harvester is in operation). In addition, the high summer temperatures, dry conditions and low humidity in the field at harvest time do not favour the prolonged survival of bioaerosols. This study provides scientific data on the survival patterns of enteric bacteria and viruses across the growing season of wheat when introduced into agricultural soil from land-applied biosolids. The practical application of the results to cereal production enables key stakeholders to consider the areas of risk across the supply chain of grain production to contribute towards consumer safety and public protection. It was concluded that pathogens from biosolids are of greatest risk to humans directly involved with the handling of biosolids following dispatch from the wastewater treatment plant since microbial contamination levels are highest during this time. In addition, the Australian climate is not suited to prolonged survival of enteric pathogens outside of the host, particularly from spring to summer where soil moisture declines and soil temperatures increase. The pathways to ingestion are low where <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> are maintained and correct management procedures are followed such as the incorporation of biosolids with the soil within the appropriate timeframe. Therefore, the main pathway for the transmission of disease-causing pathogens to humans may be more prevalent where poor hygiene practices occur...|$|R

Several drug classes can theoretically affect {{the magnitude of the}} {{increase in}} FEV 1. Withholding periods are advised for many but not all such drugs. Anecdotally, many subjects presenting for PFT are found to have taken drugs that might affect the test. We did an audit of patients presenting for PFT to assess the frequency with which FEV 1 reversibility might be affected by drugs. Methods: One hundred subjects presenting to the laboratory for PFT were questioned about recent drug consumption by an independent pharmacy intern. Reversibility of FEV 1 was assumed to have been affected if drugs of interest were consumed within defined withholding periods or two half-lives for drugs without such data. Results: Sixty-three subjects were prescribed drugs likely to affect FEV 1 reversibility. Thirty-six subjects consumed at least one such drug within the <b>withholding</b> <b>period.</b> Half (18) of these patients consumed β-blockers with or without β-agonists. Sixty-five subjects did not recall receiving any advice about withholding drugs prior to the test and only 10 recalled receiving advice from their clinician or pulmonary function technician. Conclusion: Subjects presenting for PFT are infrequently advised to withhold drugs that may affect FEV 1 reversibility, and consequently, often take such drugs close to the time of the test. Therefore, {{it is likely that the}} increase in FEV 1 is frequently affected by interference from drugs and this might impact on diagnosis and/or treatment options.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} frequency on leaf physiomorphological processes of rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium capitatum x P. radens cv. Rose) {{was investigated in}} a glasshouse study at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, from November 2005 to October 2006. Daily, and every 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, and 5 th day irrigation were applied as treatments. Leaf samples for electron-microscopic observations were taken one week prior to harvesting, whereafter all plants were re-watered. For each of the irrigation frequency treatments, 50 % of the plants were then exposed to a one-week irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> (brief stress treatment) prior to harvesting. During this period, physiological properties were recorded {{on a daily basis}} to identify or monitor change. Higher irrigation frequency and a brief water stress period increased essential oil yield. Lower irrigation frequency tended to increase the citronellol to geraniol (C:G) ratio to unacceptably high levels (C:G > 3). Upon re-watering, stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Rt) were significantly lower for the lower irrigation frequency treatments, compared to the higher irrigation frequency treatments, while no noticeable differences were observed in water potential (yw) and relative water content (RWC). At the end of the one-week stress period, Gs, Rt, yw and RWC were lower for the plants that were more frequently irrigated compared to the less frequently irrigated treatments. Water stress reduced leaf size, and apparently increased trichome density, whereas the total number of trichomes per leaf remained more or less the same, indicating that total essential oil yield is mainly affected by leaf number (and not by leaf size or trichome number). Stomatal closure was the main water stress avoiding/adaptation mechanism. These results demonstrate that rose-scented geranium plants can make physiomorphological adaptations to save water. However, such a water saving strategy was counter-productive, since it resulted in lower essential oil yield and lower water-use efficiency.

40|$|A {{variety of}} indices {{have been used}} to measure soil and crop drought for {{irrigation}} scheduling. However, simple indices with physiological mechanisms from soil water content are still expected. Based on the water flow and supply in a soil-plant continuum, we examined the concepts of soil drought intensity and drought degree and found an empirical correlation between soil water storage and depletion in a given layer. Accordingly, an index of soil drought intensity (I) and degree (D) was established using the soil water data obtained from a field experiment conducted in Xianning, Hubei, China. Corn plants (Zea mays L., Yedan 13) were grown at field plots under a movable rain shelter. From the V 6 stage to R 1 stage, the corn plants were grown under seven soil water deficit levels, by no irrigation applied for 0 - 36 days in 2005 and 0 - 32 days in 2006. At the end of the irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>period,</b> it was found that soil water below 70 cm still remained at high level, but the soil water was not easily transported to the root zone in the upper layer. The daily values of I in different soil layers reflected the soil water depletion rates in the drying course. The values of D in different soil layers, which were calculated from I, increased with the progressive soil drying course. The D index in different soil layers not only revealed the drought severity of the layer, but it was also inversely correlated with corn yields when D was less than the threshold values. When D went beyond the thresholds, for example 0. 68 in 2005 (soil dried 25 days) and 0. 70 in 2006 (soil dried 17 days) in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer, the corn yield was reduced significantly. Based on soil water changes, index D is the comprehensive result of antecedent soil water condition, crop growth and root development, soil properties, and potential atmospheric evaporation. It is also comparable to the development of drought hazard on a crop. The results suggest that soil drought degree D, together with I, can be an index for monitoring and evaluating soil-crop drought, as well as complementing the crop water stress index (CWSI) in irrigation scheduling.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 1998 and 1999 in the Khorasan Agricultural Research Center at Mashhad with the aim to study the effect of early season drought stress {{on a variety of}} sugar beet genotypes. The irrigation of the field was <b>withhold</b> for a <b>period</b> of about 50 days in order to impose a severe drought stress at the 8 to 10 leaf stage of sugar beet crop. The drought stress was evaluated by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, measured in the fully expanded leaves of three beet genotypes in 1998 and nine genotypes in 1999, both in stressed and non-stressed plants. The results showed that in the 1998 experiment, both maximal (F m) and variable (F v) fluorescence were reduced during the growth period, but the reduction was greater under drought conditions than under non-stress conditions. The quantum yield of photochemistry in Photosystem II (F v /F m) remained unaffected under non-stress conditions, but reduced under drought stress. In the 1999 experiment, initial fluorescence (F o) was not affected by drought stress, whereas chlorophyll content of stressed plant was greater than that of non-stressed. Thus, drought stress had no destructive effect on the initial fluorescence, presumably due to increase in chlorophyll content of stressed sugar beet. Under stress conditions, F v, F m and F v /F m were reduced for all genotypes, but the reduction rates varied between genotypes. The genotype 7219. P 129 showed the highest reduction of F v, F m and F v /F m under drought stress conditions, that suggests the highest sensitive to drought stress. In all genotypes, F v /F m recovered 16 days after stress relief, although, their reactions were different. Strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 75) between the white sugar yield and F v /F m has been found, suggesting that chlorophyll fluorescence {{can be used as a}} tool for screening sugar beet genotypes for early season drought stress...|$|R

Mastitis {{remains the most}} costly infectious disease affecting dairy herds despite the decades of research on its control and prevention. Persistence of preexisting intramammary infections (IMI) throughout the dry period and development of new IMI during the dry period are two important factors that influence the risk for manifestation of clinical mastitis in the next lactation. Blanket dry cow therapy (DCT) is one strategy that has been highly successful to prevent and control this disease. It {{is defined as the}} intramammary treatment of all quarters of all cows with a long-lasting antibiotic formulation at dry off, and it has the purpose of curing preexisting IMI and preventing new IMI that could be potentially acquired during the dry period. Although dry cow antibiotic formulations are widely used in dairy herds across the United States, the efficacy of these products was typically established many years or decades ago, and well-designed head-to-head studies comparing efficacy among DCT products have been largely lacking. The main goal of this multi-herd, multi-state study was to provide producers with information on the relative efficacy of three commercially available DCT products. This information could help guide in the selection of DCT products, thus promoting cow health and welfare, economic sustainability of the dairy farm and judicious drug use. The three products compared in this study were QUARTERMASTER (QT, 100, 000 IU procaine penicillin G and 1 g dyhydrostreptomycin), SPECTRAMAST DC (SP, 500 mg ceftiofur hydrochloride) and ToMORROW Dry Cow (TM, 300 mg cephapirin benzathine). Efficacy of the products was assessed at both the quarter and cow level. The first objective {{of this study was to}} describe and compare the efficacy of the three aforementioned DCT formulations at the quarter level. The effects of treatment on risk for presence of an IMI after calving, risk for cure of an IMI during the dry period, risk for development of a new IMI during the dry period and risk of a clinical mastitis event between calving and 100 days in milk (DIM) were evaluated separately. The second objective was to describe and compare efficacy of the same three products regarding cow level health and production parameters for the first 100 DIM, including milk production, linear score (LS), risk of culling and death, risk for a clinical mastitis case and risk for pregnancy. A total of 1, 091 cows (4, 364 quarters) from six commercial dairy herds in four different states (CA, IA, MN and WI) were enrolled and randomized to one of the three treatments at dry off. Quarter milk samples were collected for bacterial culture prior to treatment at dry off, at 0 to 6 DIM and at 7 to 13 DIM. All clinical mastitis, pregnancy, culling and death events occurring in the first 100 DIM were recorded by farm staff using an on-farm electronic record keeping system. Dairy Herd Information Association electronic records were used to retrieve consecutive test data regarding milk production, milk composition and LS until 100 DIM, as well as previous lactation milk production and last LS before dry off. The overall crude quarter level prevalence of infection at dry off was 19. 2 %. The most common pathogen isolated from milk samples at dry off was coagulase negative Staphylococcus (53. 9 %), followed by Aerococcus spp. (12. 3 %) and other Streptococcus spp. (7. 4 %). At the quarter level, there was no effect of treatment on risk for presence of an IMI at 0 to 6 DIM (least square means [LSM]: QT = 0. 16 (95 % CI: 0. 14, 0. 19), SP = 0. 14 (95 % CI: 0. 12, 0. 17) and TM = 0. 16 (95 % CI: 0. 14, 0. 19)), risk for a cure between dry off and calving (LSM: QT = 0. 93 (95 % CI: 0. 87, 0. 97), SP = 0. 93 (95 % CI: 0. 86, 0. 96) and TM = 0. 94 (95 % CI: 0. 89, 0. 97)), risk for development of a new IMI between dry off and 0 to 6 DIM (LSM: QT = 0. 15 (95 % CI: 0. 12, 0. 18), SP = 0. 12 (95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 15) and TM = 0. 14 (95 % CI: 0. 12, 0. 17)) or risk to experience a clinical mastitis event between calving and 100 DIM (QT = 5. 3 %, SP = 3. 8 % and TM = 4. 1 %). The cow level analysis showed there was no effect of treatment on milk production per day (LSM: QT = 42. 9 kg, SP = 42. 1 kg and SP = 42. 8 kg), milk protein production per day (LSM: QT = 1. 21, SP = 1. 18 and TM = 1. 19), 305 ME (LSM: QT = 11, 587 kg, SP = 11, 463 kg and TM = 11, 540 kg), linear score (LSM: QT = 1. 9, SP = 2. 0 and TM = 1. 7), risk for a clinical mastitis episode (QT = 14. 8 %, SP = 12. 7 % and TM = 15. 0 %), risk for leaving the herd (QT = 7. 5 %, SP = 9. 2 % and TM = 10. 3 %) or risk for pregnancy by 100 DIM (QT = 31. 5 %, SP = 26. 1 % and TM = 26. 9 %). There was an effect of treatment on ECM production (LSM: QT = 41. 4 kg a, SP = 40. 3 kg b and TM = 41. 1 kg a,b, P = 0. 0496), FCM production (LSM: QT = 41. 9 kg a, SP = 40. 7 kg b and SP = 41. 7 kg a,b, P = 0. 03) and fat production (LSM: QT = 1. 44 kg a, SP = 1. 39 kg b and TM = 1. 43 kg a,b, P = 0. 03) by 100 DIM. Contrast analysis showed that cows treated with QT had a trend for higher ECM production by 100 DIM and produced more FCM and milk fat when compared to cows treated with SP. In conclusion, with the exception of ECM, FCM and milk fat production, this study found no difference in efficacy among the three commercial DCT antibiotic formulations evaluated. Dairy farmers and herd managers should consider the findings of this study alongside with other product related characteristics such as dry period length, meat and milk <b>withhold</b> <b>periods</b> and cost, in order to help guide the selection of DCT products for use in their herds...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of pesticides in drainage water from rice in the MIA that frequently exceeded NSW Environmental Protection Agency {{guidelines for the}} protection of aquatic ecosystems led to rice growers with-holding water for up to 28 days. This project investigated the effects of different irrigation management systems on the dissipation of these chemicals after they are sprayed onto the free water of rice fields and accumulation of salt when water containing pesticides was retained on farm. A model was evaluated for its ability to simulate the fate of the pesticide molinate and hence predict the load in rice floodwaters prior to drainage. The aim of the project was to provide improved methods to minimize off-farm pesticide contamination. Dissipation of molinate and thiobencarb was determined in a 27 ha commercial rice field using a ‘static’ bankless channel irrigation system. The half-life was found to be 2. 7 days for molinate (@ 2 L/ha), and 3. 6 days for thiobencarb, (@ 3. 75 L/ha). The time required for the highest average concentration to dissipate to EPA Notification Levels of 3. 4 μg/L for molinate and 2. 8 μg/L for thiobencarb would be 24. 4 days and 21. 5 days, respectively. Subsequently, the dissipation of molinate, thiobencarb, clomazone and chlorpyrifos was determined in a small plot trial consisting of 12 individual plots. The half-life for molinate was 4. 7 days @ 2 L/ha and 4. 2 - 5. 6 days @ 3. 75 L/ha. The half-life for thiobencarb ranged between 3. 4 - 4. 1 days when applied at 3. 75 L/ha. The half-life of clomazone applied at 0. 5 L/ha was 2. 9 - 7. 2 days. The half-life for chlorpyrifos applied at 0. 1 L/ha was 5. 4 days. The persistence for molinate ranged from 33. 6 to 42 days; for thiobencarb ranged from 22. 2 to 29. 6 days and for chlorpyrifos ranged from 48. 6 to 59. 4 days to reach EPA notification levels. Although there are no set EPA Notification Levels for clomazone, it would take 14 days for values to dissipate to 3 μg/L. These data would suggest that the current <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> of 28 days is adequate for complete dissipation of thiobencarb and clomazone but in some situations is inadequate for dissipation of molinate and chlorpyrifos. The effect of sampling position within bays and proximity of bays to water inflow points on pesticide concentration was studied in a commercial rice field with a bankless channel and zig-zag water flow pattern. Sampling position within a bay had a significant (P< 0. 05) effect on the concentration of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide molinate but only in the bay which was closest to the water inflow point, not in other bays. The concentration of both molinate and chlorpyrifos increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in a direction distal from the bankless channel. There was no significant effect on the proximity of levees to sampling position. Concentrations of molinate and chlorpyrifos were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in the top bay compared with two other bays located down the fall of the field, further away from the supply of water. The herbicide benzofenap was not affected by the sampling position within any of the bays, but the concentrations in the bay nearest the supply were all significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than in other two bays.

40|$|Introducing {{effective}} irrigation {{management in}} arid and semi-arid regions, like most areas of South Africa, is an indispensable way of maximising crop yield and enhancing productivity of scarce freshwater resources. Holistic improvements in agricultural water management could be realised through integrating {{the knowledge of}} crop-specific water requirements. In order to develop effective irrigation schedules for rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium capitatum x P. radens), greenhouse and field experiments were conducted at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa, from 28 October 2004 to 2006. Results from 20, 40, 60 and 80 % maximum allowable depletion (MAD) levels of the plant available soil water (ASW) indicated that plant roots extracted most of the soil water from the top 40 cm soil layer, independent of the treatment. Both essential oil yield and fresh herbage mass responded positively to high soil water content. Increasing the MAD level to 60 % and higher resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} herbage mass and essential oil yields. An increase in the degree of water stress apparently increased the essential oil concentration (percentage oil on fresh herbage mass basis), but its contribution to total essential oil yield (kg/ha oil) was limited. There was no significant relationship between MAD level and essential oil composition. For water saving without a significant reduction in essential oil yield of rose-scented geranium, a MAD of 40 % of ASW is proposed. Response of rose-scented geranium to a one-month irrigation <b>withholding</b> <b>period</b> in the second or third month of regrowth cycles showed that herbage mass and oil yield were positively related. Herbage yield was significantly reduced when the water stress period was imposed during the third or fourth month of regrowth. A remarkable essential oil yield loss was observed only when the plants were stressed during the fourth month of regrowth. Essential oil content (% oil on fresh herbage mass basis) was higher in stressed plants, especially when stressed late, but oil yield dropped due to lower herbage mass. The relationship between essential oil composition and irrigation treatments was not consistent. Water-use efficiency was not significantly affected by withholding irrigation in the second or in the third month of regrowth. With a marginal oil yield loss, about 330 to 460 m 3 of water per hectare per regrowth cycle could be saved by withholding irrigation during the third month of regrowth. The overall results highlighted that in water-scarce regions withholding irrigation during either the second or the third month of regrowth in rose-scented geranium could save water that could be used by other sectors of society. In greenhouse pot experiments, rose-scented geranium was grown under different irrigation frequencies, in two growth media. Irrigation was withheld on 50 % of the plants (in each plot) for the week prior to harvesting. Herbage and essential oil yields were better in the sandy clay soil than in silica sand. Essential oil content (% oil on fresh herbage mass basis) apparently increased with a decrease in irrigation frequency. Both herbage and total essential oil yields positively responded to frequent irrigation. A one-week stress period prior to harvesting significantly increased essential oil content and total essential oil yield. Hence, the highest essential oil yield was obtained from a combination of high irrigation frequency and a one-week irrigation-withholding period. In the irrigation frequency treatments, citronellol and citronellyl formate contents tended to increase with an increase in the stress level, but the reverse was true for geraniol and geranyl formate. Leaf physiological data were recorded during the terminal one-week water stress in the glasshouse pot trial. Upon rewatering, stomatal conductance (Gs) and transpiration rate (Rt) were significantly lower in the less often irrigated than in the more often irrigated treatments, while leaf water potential (yw) and relative water content (RWC) were the same for all plants, indicating that water stress had an after-effect on Gs and Rt. At the end of the stress period, Gs, Rt, yw and RWC were lower in the plants from the more often irrigated than from the less often irrigated treatments. Irrespective of irrigation treatment, one type of non-glandular and two types (different in shape and size) of glandular trichomes were observed. In water stressed-conditions, stomata and trichome densities increased, while the total number of stomata and trichomes per leaf appeared to remain more or less the same. Water stress conditions resulted in stomatal closure. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Plant Production and Soil Scienceunrestricte...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{production}} of quality wine {{is influenced by}} numerous factors of which grape quality {{is one of the}} most important factors. The {{production of}} quality wine, however, is not possible without good winemaking techniques and effective quality control. Critical control points (CCP) during the winemaking process must be identified to ensure optimum wine quality. Grape must is a complex medium that contains different micro-organisms which can be either beneficial or negative to wine quality, depending on the physical and chemical conditions that prevail in the must. Yeasts are responsible for alcoholic fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for malolactic fermentation (MLF) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) for the production acetic acid from ethanol. Yeasts and certain LAB can also produce acetic acid and thereby increasing the volatile acidity (VA) of wine. These micro-organisms can influence each other in complex fashions by competing for growth nutrients and by producing inhibitory substances. Most winemakers nowadays use commercial yeast strains to inoculate wine fermentations. This, however, does not assure a problem-free fermentation and cases of stuck and sluggish fermentations are annually reported worldwide. In these or most cases fermentation takes longer than 21 days to complete and the wine contains a residual sugar concentration of more than 4 g/L, which can be utilised by wine spoilage micro-organisms such as certain bacteria and other wild yeasts. Stuck and sluggish fermentations also increase the chances of oxidation due to the absence of the protective CO 2 layer on the surface of the wine, which is formed during alcoholic fermentation. Another effect of stuck and sluggish fermentations is that valuable tank space is wasted due to the unexpected time consumption of these fermentation problems. Many factors during the winemaking process can be responsible for stuck and sluggish fermentations. In this thesis the different factors is discussed with the emphasis on the effect of the yeast strain. The way that certain yeast strains influence AAB and LAB numbers during fermentation and MLF through the production of inhibiting by-products such as medium chain fatty acids has not been investigated in detail in the past. Certain fungicides and pesticides that are used in vineyards to control pests (e. g. mildew) contain copper which can be inhibiting to yeast growth and alcoholic fermentation. Legal limits and <b>withholding</b> <b>periods</b> on these sprays are not always strictly obeyed and can lead to stuck and sluggish fermentations. This motivated us to evaluate the growth and fermentation activities of a selection of commercial wine yeasts in the presence of copper levels in the range of maximum legal limits. The effect of these commercial strains on the LAB and AAB numbers during alcoholic fermentation and MLF were also investigated. Our results showed that there was no significant difference on numbers of the AAB obtained from fermentations inoculated with different commercial wine yeast strains. However, with regards to the LAB numbers, one of the strains produced significantly more sulphur dioxide (SO 2), which led to the inhibition of MLF in that wine. Our results further indicated which commercial yeast strains were capable of effectively fermenting high sugar musts and which strains were less effective. From the strains tested VIN 13, N 96 & L 2056 were able to utilize fructose more effectively than NT 50, RJ 11 & D 80. We could further distinguish between yeast strains that produced the lowest (VIN 13 & RJ 11) and the highest (WE 372, NT 50 & L 2056) VA concentrations in must containing high sugar levels. Strains that were more tolerant against high copper levels were also identified. We tested six yeast strains in must with added copper (0. 25 mM cu 2 +) in the form of CuSO 4. H 2 O. Three Cu 2 +-tolerant (D 80, Collection Cepage Cabernet & NT 50) yeast strains were distinguished from three less Cu 2 +-tolerant yeast strains (VIN 13, NT 112 & RJ 11). This study made a valuable contribution in knowledge gained about commercially available wine yeast strains that can ferment effectively under certain stress conditions. Research such as this, where wine yeasts are evaluated to ferment more effectively during strenuous winemaking conditions, will be very beneficial to winemakers. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die produksie van gehalte wyn word deur verskillende faktore beïnvloed waarvan druifkwaliteit seker die belangrikste is. Die produksie van gehalte wyn is egter nie moontlik sonder goeie wynmaaktegnieke en effektiewe kwaliteitsbeheer nie. Kritieke kontrole punte (KKP) tydens die wynmaakproses moet dus geïdentifiseer word om sodoende ‘n verlaging in wynkwaliteit te vermy. Druiwemos het ‘n komplekse mikrobiologiese samestelling en bestaan uit verskillende mikroörganismes wat vooren nadelig vir wynkwaliteit kan wees, afhangende van die fisiese en chemiese toestande wat in die mos bestaan. Giste is verantwoordelik vir alkoholiese fermentasie, melksuurbakterieë (MSB) vir appelmelksuurgisting (AMG) en asynsuurbakterieë (ASB) vir die produksie van asynsuur vanaf etanol. Asynsuur word egter ook deur giste en MSB geproduseer en dra so by tot die vlugtige suurheid (VS) van ‘n wyn. Hierdie mikroörganismes kan mekaar op komplekse wyses beïnvloed deur o. a. te kompeteer vir voedingstowwe asook deur die produksie van inhiberende verbindings. Die meeste wynmakers maak gebruik van kommersiële gisrasse om alkoholiese fermentasies mee uit te voer. Gevalle van sogenaamde slepende en gestaakte alkoholiese fermentasies, waar suiker nie volledig na etanol en CO 2 omgeskakel word nie, kom egter nog gereeld in die wynbedryf voor. In sulke gevalle neem die fermentasie gewoonlik langer as 21 dae om te voltooi met ‘n suiker konsentrasie van meer as 4 g/L wat in die wyn oorbly. Dit is nadelig vir wynkwaliteit aangesien dit nie net die kanse vir bederf deur bakterieë en giste verhoog nie, maar ook die kanse vir oksidasie verhoog a. g. v. die verlies van die beskermende CO 2 lagie bo-oor die wyn. Hoe sekere gisrasse, ASB en MSB getalle gedurende fermentasie en AMG beïnvloed deur die produksie van inhiberende verbindings soos medium ketting vetsure en SO 2, is ook nie baie in die verlede ondersoek nie. Sommige spuitstowwe wat gebruik word in die bekamping van swamsiektes bevat koper wat inhiberend kan wees vir gisgroei en alkoholiese fermentasie. Wetlike maksimum limiete en onthoudingsperiodes op spuitstofresidue word egter nie altyd gehoorsaam nie en kan lei tot slepende en gestaakte fermentasies. Dit het ons gemotiveer om ‘n seleksie van kommersiële gisrasse te evalueer in terme van gisgroei en fermentasie in die teenwoordigheid van kopervlakke naby die maksimum limiet. Ons resultate het gewys dat daar nie noemenswaardige verskille in AAB getalle tydens alkoholiese fermentasie tussen behandelings met verskillende kommersiële gisrasse was nie. Een van die gisrasse het wel noemenswaardig meer SO 2 geproduseer wat gelei het tot inhibering van AMG in hierdie wyn. Ons het verder uitgewys watter kommersiële gisrasse instaat is om meer effektief in hoër suiker mos te fermenteer en watter van die rasse minder suksesvol was. Ons het ook rasse geïdentifiseer wat meer weerstandbiedend is teen hoë kopervlakke in mos en sodoende groter kans op ‘n suksesvolle fermentasie sal hê in mos wat koperresidue bevat wat afkomstig is van sekere spuitstowwe. Die effek van die ASB en MSB getalle gedurende fermentasie en AMG is ook ondersoek. Ons resultate het verder gewys watter kommersiële gisrasse instaat was om mos met hoë suikervlakke meer effektief te fermenteer. Vam die gisrasse wat getoets was het VIN 13, N 96 & L 2056 fruktose meer effektief benut as NT 50, RJ 11 & D 80. Ons kon verder onderskei tussen gisrasse wat die laagste (VIN 13 & RJ 11) en die hoogste (WE 372, NT 50 & L 2056) vlakke van VS produseer in mos met hoë inisiële suikervlakke. Gisrasse wat meer tolerant was teen koperresidue in mos is ook geidentifiseer. Ons het ses gisrasse getoets in mos met bygevoegde koper (0. 25 mM Cu 2 +) in die vorm van CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O. Daar is onderskei tussen drie Cu 2 +-tolerante (D 80, Collection Cepage Cabernet & NT 50) en drie minder Cu 2 +-tolerante gisrasse (VIN 13, NT 112 & RJ 11). Hierdie studie lewer ‘n waardevolle bydrae in die invordering van kennis oor kommersieel beskikbare wyngisrasse wat meer effektief sal fermenteer onder sekere streskondisies wat in mos voorkom. Inligting soos hierdie is belangrik om die wynmaker se keuse uit die reeks bestaande kommersiële gisrasse te vergemaklik...|$|R
