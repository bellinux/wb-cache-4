5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends often told a story of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
25|$|The {{harvesting}} machines constantly broke down, {{which resulted in}} shooting beginning late in the afternoon, allowing {{for only a few}} hours of light before it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to go on. One day, two helicopters were scheduled to drop peanut shells that were to simulate locusts on film; however, Malick decided to shoot period cars instead. He kept the helicopters on hold at great cost. Production was lagging behind, with costs exceeding the budget $3,000,000 by about $800,000, and Schneider had already mortgaged his home in order to cover the overages.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} first film, Gremlins 2 is a live action horror comedy film; however, Dante put effort into taking the sequel in new anarchic directions. The film {{is meant to be}} more cartoon-like and less dark than the original, and the {{violence}} is fairly slapstick. There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, most notably Gremlins itself, as well as the Rambo films, The Wizard of Oz, Marathon Man and The Phantom of the Opera. As {{with the first}} film, critical response varied. Some critics who thought the first film <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> gave Gremlins 2 better reviews, but it received a colder reception from fans who thought otherwise.|$|E

McDonald's shut down their Happy Meal promotion for the film. Burton responded, [...] "I like Batman Returns {{better than the}} first one.

500|$|Huds {{budget was}} $2.35million, and Paramount {{executives}} were {{unhappy with the}} film. They felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> and were displeased by the black-and-white cinematography and Hud's lack of remorse and unchanged behavior. Although Martin Rackin asked Ritt to change the film's ending, he and Newman decided to keep the original. After Hud was previewed, Paramount considered dropping the project, feeling {{that it was not}} [...] "commercial enough", but Ritt flew to New York and convinced the executives to release the film unmodified.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Weinstein, {{when the}} episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark,</b> lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. Weinstein {{considers}} this episode {{one of the}} most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he thinks many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein also talks about a [...] "generation gap"—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E

500|$|David Denby of New York {{magazine}} {{felt that}} the film would not make sense to viewers who had not previously read the book. Denby wrote that the film <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> and lacked humor, concluding that [...] "The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end." [...] Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described The Lord of The Rings as one of two films that demonstrated [...] "that Bakshi was utterly lacking in the artistic self-discipline that might have permitted him to outgrow his limitations." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the struggles}} that Whedon had with Fox was {{the tone of}} the show, {{especially}} with the main character Malcolm Reynolds. Fox pressured Whedon to make Mal more [...] "jolly", as they feared he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> in the original pilot, epitomized by the moment he suggests he might [...] "space" [...] Simon and River, throwing them out of the airlock to die. In addition, Fox was not happy that the show involved the [...] "nobodies" [...] who [...] "get squished by policy" [...] instead of the actual policy makers.|$|E
500|$|Gene Roddenberry {{originated}} {{the idea}} for the episode in a single-sentence proposal entitled [...] "The Assassins". Robert Sabaroff expanded this idea to thirty pages, but his version was seen as too expensive. Tracy Tormé was then given the job of rewriting it, but some producers thought the new version <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> until Roddenberry saw it and endorsed the new version. In one of the original versions, it was a faction within Starfleet who were conspirators rather than alien parasites, but Roddenberry did not like showing Starfleet itself in such a dark manner. The premise was based on the Iran–Contra affair.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Stephen Thompson. The {{producers}} wished to develop a Doctor Who episode set on [...] "the high seas." [...] The episode was also made to allow the Doctor and his companions to [...] "kick back and have some fun." [...] As the episode was pirate-themed, the producers wanted to fit in as many elements as possible from pirate fiction, including treasure, mutinies, a stowaway boy, walking the plank, storms, swords, and a pirate with a [...] "good heart" [...] who [...] "isn't really evil." [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot" [...] was originally planned to be ninth in the series, but was moved forward prior to filming as executive producer Steven Moffat felt {{the first half of}} the series <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kate Capshaw {{called her}} {{character}} [...] "not {{much more than}} a dumb screaming blonde." [...] Steven Spielberg said in 1989, [...] "I wasn't happy with Temple of Doom at all. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark,</b> too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E
500|$|Weir {{wanted the}} film to be funnier, feeling that Niccol's script <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark,</b> and declaring [...] "where he [...] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could {{convince}} audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7." [...] Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star, but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar, {{he would not be}} ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.|$|E

500|$|On April 24, 1889, McAleer {{broke into}} the Major Leagues in Cleveland, Ohio, where he {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} graceful outfielder. In 1891, when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders, the club became known for its aggressive tactics. Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who [...] "decided it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to continue a game". On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident. Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, [...] "until the Spiders mended their ways." [...] McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds, Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his bat.|$|E
500|$|Wadsworth {{made her}} fourth depth charge {{attack on a}} U-boat on 29July. At about 17:25, she dropped several charges in what {{appeared}} to be the wake of a submarine proceeding submerged. The conjecture that a U-boat was damaged was supported by the appearance of a large amount of heavy oil on the surface following the attack. Just before 23:00, the warship attacked another supposed submarine wake. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to evaluate the results; but, not long thereafter, [...] struck a submerged metallic object which caused her to list 10° temporarily. Later, Wadsworths wireless operator intercepted messages sent by a German submarine over a period of about half an hour which suggested that Wadsworth may have damaged a submarine, although as with the depth-charge attack of 21June, no definite proof was forthcoming. Early in August, the destroyer concluded her summer of peak activity by escorting the first United States merchant convoy on the last leg of its voyage to Europe. During the mission, on the 16th, the destroyer dropped a barrage on what was thought to be a submarine.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were strongly}} praised. One reviewer appreciated {{the variety of}} styles in the music; it {{has been compared to}} Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times [...] "neutral" [...] and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; Computer and Video Games noted they were [...] "superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension", while Next Generation wrote that Anachronox would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. The Guardian, while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many [...] "little details that bring the game to life" [...] and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that ION Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were [...] "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". The Guardian felt the lighting <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> in general, while Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald found the graphics blocky.|$|E
