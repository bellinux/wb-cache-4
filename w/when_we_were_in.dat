40|$|Looking {{to other}} models of civil {{marriage}} {{can only be}} suggestive rather than prescriptive. It {{is unlikely that the}} solution in any one place will serve as a template or road map {{that can be used to}} navigate very different terrain. One of the most important approaches that <b>we</b> can take <b>when</b> dealing with difficult social and political issues is to think about the issue from the point of view of the minority (<b>when</b> <b>we</b> find ourselves in the religious or political majority) and from the point of view of the majority (<b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a political or religious minority). Ultimately, all of us benefit from the realization that, when it comes to religion, we all belong to a religious minority. In the flat, crowded and dangerous world in which <b>we</b> live, there <b>is</b> no such thing as a religious majority. Even Christians, with their billion or so, and Muslims, with their billion or so, are a religious minority <b>when</b> <b>we</b> think from a global perspective. Remembering the rights and interests of minorities is especially important at times <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find ourselves in temporary or localized majorities. Our claims to be treated fairly and with respect <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the minority will <b>be</b> stronger if <b>we</b> treat others fairly and with respect <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the majority...|$|R

2500|$|During {{training}} in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement {{of the match}} for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: [...] "That {{was the best thing}} that happened to Ali <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Africa—the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box." [...] Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.|$|E

2500|$|As {{president}} of Virginia's constitutional convention {{in the fall}} of 1829, Monroe reiterated his belief that slavery was a blight which, even as a British colony, Virginia had attempted to eradicate. [...] "What was the origin of our slave population?" [...] he rhetorically asked. [...] "The evil commenced <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> our Colonial state, but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature, prohibiting the importation, of more slaves, into the Colony. These were rejected by the Crown." [...] To the dismay of states' rights proponents, he was willing to accept the federal government's financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other countries. At the convention, Monroe made his final public statement on slavery, proposing that Virginia emancipate and deport its bondsmen with [...] "the aid of the Union." ...|$|E

[...] Coincidentally, Asher had played Luke Roberts' mother once before, in the 2001 revival of ITV soap Crossroads. Asher has commented on the co-incidence: [...] "It's the second time I've played Luke Roberts' [...] mother - the first was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Crossroads together [...] We get along really well and are very fond of each other." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle was asked in November 2007: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher [...] and Patsy Kensit [...] - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?", to which she responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At Linares 1994, Polgár lost a {{controversial}} game to the World Champion Garry Kasparov. The tournament {{marked the first}} time the 17-year-old Polgár was invited to compete with the world's strongest players. After four games she had two points. During her game with Kasparov in the fifth round, Kasparov gradually outplayed her and had a clear advantage after 35 moves. On his 36th move, the [...] World Champion reportedly changed his mind about the move of a knight, and moved the piece to a different square. According to chess rules, once a player has released a piece, the move must stand, so if Kasparov did remove his hand, he should have been required to play his original move. Polgár did not challenge Kasparov, in the moment, because, she stated, [...] "I was playing the World Champion and didn't want to cause unpleasantness during my first invitation to such an important event. I was also afraid that if my complaint was overruled I would be penalized on the clock <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> time pressure." [...] She did however look questioningly at the arbiter, Carlos Falcon, who witnessed the incident and took no action.|$|E

And we – his friends – are the living witnesses to his enduring influence for over half a century, he built an empire of friendship, embracing students, scholars and all Jews, regardless of status or station in life And yet, he was more than teacher, colleague, and friend.

Gone will be the gentle wit and gifted storyteller, gone will be the sage counselor and pius Jew, gone will be the humble spirit and songful soul, alas, gone will be Rabbi Alstat. We, his sorrowing family of disciples, mourn his passing but shall ever continue to invoke his spirit. His memory will ever be blessed.|$|E

Using the audio spectrum as basic model for the BG characterization solves the problem of camouflage, because different sounds having the same spectral characteristic (so, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> presence of similar sounds) will produce a spectrum where the spectral intensities are summed over.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors develop a {{descriptive}} theory of choice using anticipated emotions. People {{are assumed to}} anticipate how they will feel about the outcomes of decisions and use their predictions to guide choice. The authors measure the pleasure associated with monetary outcomes of gambles and offer an account of judged pleasure called decision affect theory. Then they propose a theory of choices between gambles based on anticipated pleasure. People are assumed to choose the option with greater subjective expected pleasure. Similarities and differences between subjective expected pleasure theory and subjective expected utility theory are discussed. Emotions have powerful effects on choice. Our actual feelings of happiness, sadness, and anger both color and shape our decisions. In addition, our imagined feelings of guilt, elation, or regret influence our decisions. In this article we refer to these two influences as experienced emotions and anticipated emotions. Experienced emotions affect many levels of cognitive processing. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> good moods, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> better problem solvers (Isen, 1984, 1987, 1993), more likely to remember happy events (Bower, 1981), more risk seeking (Kahn & Isen, 1993), and more optimistic about the chances of favorable events (Wright & Bower, 1992; Nygren, Isen, Taylor, & Dulin, 1996). <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> bad moods, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> more likely to recall negative events (Bower, 1981) and overestimate the chances of unfavorable events (Johnson & Tversky, 1983).

However, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a heavy-tailed context (in particular when our data are described by a Pareto distribution, as <b>is</b> common <b>in</b> much of extreme value theory), the theory of [4] is insufficient, and requires an additional regularization step which we introduce.
