A Philadelphia-based company called NovaThermal Energy partnered with Philadelphia Water on a project that warms a building with heat derived from sewage.

50|$|Energy usage in some homes {{may vary}} widely from these averages. For example, milder regions {{such as the}} Southern U.S. and Pacific Coast of the USA need far less energy for space {{conditioning}} than New York City or Chicago. On the other hand, air conditioning energy use can be quite high in hot-arid regions (Southwest) and hot-humid zones (Southeast) In milder climates such as San Diego, lighting energy may easily consume up to 40% of total energy. Certain appliances such as a waterbed, hot tub, or pre-1990 refrigerator, use significant amounts of electricity. However, recent trends in home entertainment equipment can make a large difference in household energy use. For instance a 50-inch LCD television (average on-time of six hours a day) may draw 300 watts less than a similarly sized plasma system. In most residences no single appliance dominates, and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas {{in order to achieve}} substantial energy savings. However, ground, air and <b>water</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems, solar heating systems and evaporative coolers are among the more energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning and domestic hot water systems available (Environmental Protection Agency), and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 69%.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> in {{comparison}} to air-to-air <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> have significant advantage for heating or cooling applications due to the relatively regulated temperature of most water resources. In the UK, similar to many other countries, disused coal mines have untapped potential for low cost green energy due to the flooding of coal mines with water at reasonable warm temperature due to the availability of geothermal energy at different depths. This allows to use <b>water</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> in locations away from rivers and seas for heating and cooling applications. Extracting energy from flooded coal mines using water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> with open loop systems is still relatively a new concept, but can provide much heating capacity due to eliminating the time needed for heat transfer between the external environment and the heating loop in case of closed loop systems. The use of real systems to conduct research could be an expensive task or impractical to users of the application such as {{the residents of the}} served building. On the other hand, computer simulation includes significant assumptions that might not be accurate in many real situations.

Typically, these <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are capable of both heating and cooling, and historically the design emphasis has been on improving the units' cooling performance. Recently, there has been more interest in improving the heating performance, however, in order to optimize the design for improved heating performance data on the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> components operating in the heating mode are required. These data have not been available for the waterto- refrigerant heat exchangers typically installed in unitary <b>water</b> <b>source</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> The purpose of this work is to provide performance data on such heat exchangers operating as evaporators (data is available for the heat exchangers operating as condensers) {{and to provide a}} numerical model by which a limited amount of evaporator data might be expanded for system modeling and optimization studies. A well instrumented water-to-water <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> was assembled for the purpose of testing two such water-to-refrigerant heat exchangers to determine their heat transfer and refrigerant pressure drop characteristics as evaporators. The overall heat transfer coefficient for each of the two heat exchangers was found to be a strong function of both the water and refrigerant flow rates and a relatively weak function of the refrigerant evaporation temperature. The refrigerant pressure drop was determined to be highly dependent on the refrigerant flow rate and only slightly dependent on the evaporator temperature. The overall heat transfer coefficient showed an apparent difference between parallel and counter flow conditions. This coefficient, as defined by the log-mean temperature difference, was slightly higher for the counter flow condition. A numerical model of the evaporator was developed and compared with the experimental results. The model follows a numerical solution in which the governing equations (continuity, momentum, and energy) are solved for a finite control volume and an appropriate finitedifference scheme is used to continue the solution step-wise {{along the length of the}} heat exchanger. The numerical model accurately predicts the effect of flow rate and temperature on refrigerant pressure drop and the effect of water flow rate and direction on the overall heat transfer coefficient.
