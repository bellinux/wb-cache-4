5|$|Achaea <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> turmoil, {{and some}} cities {{were close to}} revolt; many {{residents}} were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities {{and then went to}} Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's departure, French troops {{held off}} British and Ottoman attacks for another 18 months. In March 1801, the British landed at Aboukir Bay. Menou <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> {{command of the}} French expedition. His troops, {{including}} the Commission, marched north towards the Mediterranean coast to meet the enemy, transporting the stone {{along with many other}} antiquities. He was defeated in battle, and the remnant of his army retreated to Alexandria where they were surrounded and besieged, the stone now inside the city. Menou surrendered on August 30.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding out}} in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> short supply {{and most of the}} men had not eaten for over twenty-four hours.|$|E

5|$|Although Paisley <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> {{charge of}} the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie {{to do the same}} for Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers to defend against a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from the survivors of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} miners {{were able to}} reach a {{settlement}} in early 1990, the case of the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into bargaining until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E

5|$|However, on 14 March, Malenkov {{resigned}} from the secretariat of the Central Committee. This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> charge of the party. The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth and {{his growing}} force then {{continued}} north via Bridgwater, {{where he took}} up residence at Bridgwater Castle (21 June), Glastonbury (22 June) and Shepton Mallet (23 June) in worsening weather. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy captured Monmouth's ships, cutting off any hope of an escape back to the continent. The Royalist forces of Churchill, who <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Chard, and of Feversham, in Bristol, also received reinforcements who had marched from London.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2015, Reinfeldt {{confirmed}} that he <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> {{a relationship with}} Roberta Alenius. Alenius served as Head of Communications (Chief of the Press Secretaries) at the Cabinet Office from 2006 to 2014, while Reinfeldt served as Prime Minister. On 2 May 2017, Alenius gave birth to Reinfeldts fourth child and second daughter.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{the time}} bonus on the finish line, Kristoff <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> third place overall, just 11 seconds behind Terpstra.

5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor. He sought to guard against such a turn by keeping the Crown Prince from a {{position}} of any influence and by using foul means as well as fair to make him unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Though Endeavour <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> good condition, {{her crew}} were not. During the ship's stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94people aboard {{had been taken}} ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time Endeavour set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the {{following}} twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship's surgeon William Monkhouse.|$|E

5|$|Although {{connected}} with the council, Gilbert was tried after the council closed, at a consistory held in the Archbishop of Reims' chambers. A consistory was a specialized form of trial held to investigate questionable theological teachings, and was beginning {{to be used for}} this purpose in this period. The consistory lasted two days, and included John of Salisbury, who had previously been a student of Gilbert's, but <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Eugene's service. The trial likely took place on 2–3 April 1148, as it lasted took two days, and most accounts state that it took place during the week before Palm Sunday, which was 4 April that year. As the consistory took place after the closing of the council on 1 April, that only allows 2 and 3 April for the trial. However, if the council closed earlier than 1 April, then the trial could have taken place on 29–30 March 1148. In the end, no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert, who remained Bishop of Poitiers until his death in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn {{up in front of}} Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E

5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cooperation}} between the Mongols and their Christian subjects in Antioch, other Christians in the Levant regarded the Mongol approach with unease. Jacques Pantaléon, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, saw the Mongols as a clear threat, and had written to the Pope to warn him about them in 1256. The Franks did, however, send the Dominican David of Ashby {{to the court of}} Hulagu in 1260. In Sidon, Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon and Beaufort, described by his contemporaries as irresponsible and light-headed, took an opportunity to raid and plunder the area of the Beqaa Valley in Mongol territory. One of the Mongols killed was Kitbuqa's nephew, and in retaliation, Kitbuqa raided the city of Sidon. These events added to the level of distrust between the Mongols and the Crusader forces, whose own center of power <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> the coastal city of Acre.|$|E
5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
