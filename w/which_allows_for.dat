5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> better retention of velocity. Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> prolonged dives.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

It is the only model to feature a folding front passenger seat, making the storage space into the whole interior of the car except the driver's seat. Extras for the trim include: tinted windows, rear parking sensors, automatic windscreen wipers, a leather and chrome interior, pollen filter, and dual-zone automatic climate control, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> two varying temperature settings simultaneously in the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> a harmonization and simplification {{of linear}} maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, {{the concepts of}} linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{search is}} a simple search {{algorithm}} that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short. If the array must first be sorted, that cost must be amortized over any searches. Sorting the array also enables efficient approximate matches and other operations.|$|E
5|$|Most {{computers}} {{require the}} diver {{to specify the}} mixture before the dive, but some allow the choice of mixture to be changed during the dive, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the use of gas switching for accelerated decompression. A third category, mostly used by closed circuit rebreather divers, monitors the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing mix using a remote oxygen sensor, but requires diver intervention to specify the inert gas constituents and ratio of the mix in use.|$|E

5|$|The BRCA OB1 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB1 has a shallow groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> weak single strand DNA binding. The domain also binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein.|$|E
5|$|The BRCA OB3 domain assumes an OB fold, which {{consists}} of a highly curved five-stranded beta-sheet that closes on itself to form a beta-barrel. OB3 has a pronounced groove formed by one face of the curved sheet and is demarcated by two loops, one between beta 1 and beta 2 and another between beta 4 and beta 5, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> strong ssDNA binding.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 increases that to 340MHz, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E

When mounted in a special chuck <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E

The tiger shark {{must be able to}} twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
