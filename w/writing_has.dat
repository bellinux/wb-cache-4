It is obvious that she had a strong personality probably similar to her mother, Princess Milica of Serbia.

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The <b>writing</b> <b>has</b> been {{compared to that of}} Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E
5|$|The 'Peaks of Excellence' {{curriculum}} is continuous with the 'Broad-Base Curriculum', with more elaborate programmes {{that cater to}} students’ talent development. For instance, the Young Writers Programme, which is open to students {{who are interested in}} <b>writing,</b> <b>has</b> lessons conducted by various renowned Chinese language essayists in the region to expose and familiarise students to different forms of writing, and encourage them to appreciate different forms of written work. Students also have opportunities to attend cultural symposiums, national and international bi-cultural forums, research on contemporary issues, and embark on refined overseas immersions to strengthen their world and cultural views under the Global Classroom Programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya <b>writing</b> <b>has</b> been a long and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts {{having to do with}} numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>writing</b> <b>has</b> made {{language}} {{even more}} useful to humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's <b>writing</b> <b>has</b> received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec <b>writing</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

50|$|The perfect {{aspect is}} {{expressed}} with {{a form of}} the auxiliary have together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the present perfect is <b>have</b> <b>written</b> or <b>has</b> <b>written,</b> and the past perfect (pluperfect) is <b>had</b> <b>written.</b> The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present perfect progressive (continuous) have/has been writing and the past perfect progressive (continuous) <b>had</b> been <b>writing.</b> There is a perfect infinitive (to) <b>have</b> <b>written</b> and a perfect progressive infinitive (to) <b>have</b> been <b>writing,</b> and corresponding present participle/gerund forms <b>having</b> <b>written</b> and <b>having</b> been <b>writing.</b> A perfect subjunctive (<b>have</b> <b>written)</b> is also sometimes used.
