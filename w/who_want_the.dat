He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

On April 5, 2004 Time magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”. Author of Beijing Coma, Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 New York Times article.

He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.|$|E

He said [...] "If the money comes from Birmingham, we'll stay here but if the money comes from people in Timbuktu <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> team in Timbuktu, them we'll move there."

The British and Irish government agreed, under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, that the status of Northern Ireland will not change without the consent of a majority of its population.

With regard to Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's [...] "clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland’s current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland".|$|E
2500|$|The {{concepts}} {{of tradition and}} traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of {{a particular set of}} values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values. Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term [...] "traditionalist Catholic" [...] refers to those, such as Archbishop Lefebvre, <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65. Likewise, Sunni Muslims are referred to as Ahlus Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah (...) , literally [...] "people of the tradition [...] and the community", emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.|$|E
