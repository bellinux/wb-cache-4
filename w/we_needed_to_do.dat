500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We learned we had to do it ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know if we were going to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not the right guy to do this album." ...|$|E

You need to manage your energy as well. You first have to ask, 'What gives me energy?' There can be lots of sources: your family, exercise, your spiritual well-being... In our house, we had a family meeting every week—the family BPR —where we reviewed what <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and the support required to get us through the week. It is another kind of process step, and a really important one." ...|$|E

It was a cool story and the budget {{was going to be a}} lot higher; there were going to be helicopters and Ferraris. It was going to be very classy.

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{members of}} Yood - singer/guitarist Lazer Lloyd, bassist Yaakov Lefcoe, and drummer Akiva Girsh - met and began playing together in Beit Shemesh in 2000, but ultimately separated due to Lloyd's commitment to Reva L'Sheva, {{the outbreak of}} the Second Intifada, and their collective uncertainty about the group's profitability. However, they later regrouped in the fall of 2005, motivated by the controversial dismantling of Gaza settlements by the Israeli government, with Lloyd later saying, [...] "We just knew that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something to counteract {{what was going on in}} the country.
