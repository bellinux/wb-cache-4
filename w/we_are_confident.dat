According to the newspaper, the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875. During the course of construction, John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge. The new South Branch Bridge was completed well ahead of schedule in October 1874. The October 12, 1874, edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a [...] "complete, handsome and durable structure", and further recounted that [...] "the contractors, Messrs.

500|$|Jackson {{then joined}} with Dave McGrath of Lake Technology {{to produce a}} {{commercial}} version of the controller, the Lake Contour, essentially the same hardware but with different software. McGrath and Jackson acquired Clair Technologies LLC, the earlier joint venture. In turn, Dolby Laboratories bought Lake in 2004, Jackson staying with the product line to become {{vice president of the}} live sound division at Dolby, and by 2005 the loudspeaker controller was being used by seven of the ten top concert tours; 3,000 units had been built. Jackson moved back to Sydney in 2005 with Terri—his fourth wife—and their children, but in November he returned to the U.S. to accept his Parnelli Innovator Award. In 2006, the digital audio product was redesigned and introduced as the Dolby Lake Processor, capable of 4-in, 12-out operation as a loudspeaker crossover; 8-in, 8-out operation as a system equaliser; or a combination of 2 crossovers and 4 equalizers—the whole integrated with Smaart audio analysis software. A collaboration between Dolby and Swedish audio electronics company Lab.gruppen was announced in 2007; Jackson's technology would be incorporated into Lab.gruppen's Powered Loudspeaker Management (PLM) system. Two years later, Lab.gruppen acquired the Lake brand for further development of the PLM and other product lines. John Carey of Dolby said, [...] "As we pass the live sound torch to Lab.gruppen <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> that they will continue to innovate and evolve the technology." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{version of}} events {{presented}} by Kadyrov was that his security forces had advance notice of the operation, permitted the fighters to enter the village and disperse, and then cornered them, killing 12 [...] "devils."

Russian officials stated that all twelve slain militants were wearing explosive vests and that seven of those killed had detonated the vests and were thus unidentifiable; rebel sources in the village disputed this, citing unnamed residents of Tsentoroy who claimed {{that at least some}} of the dead identified as attackers were actually young men held in Kadyrov’s notorious private prison that were executed on his orders so as to increase the body count. Militant sources would add that the reason they were said to be “unidentifiable” was because it would have been clear that those dead were indeed long-held prisoners rather than members of the insurgent assault team, an allegation that one analyst stated was “entirely in keeping with what is known of [...] treatment of anyone suspected of abetting, or even sympathizing with the insurgency." ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{alternative}} {{procedures to}} adjust significance levels for multiplicity are the traditional Bonferroni technique, a sequential Bonferroni technique devel-oped by Hochberg (1988), and a sequential approach for controlling the false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). These procedures are illustrated and compared using {{examples from the}} National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). A prominent advantage of the Benjamini and Hochberg (B-H) procedure, as demonstrated in these examples, is the greater invariance of statistical significance for given comparisons over alternative family sizes. Simulation studies show that all three procedures maintain a false discovery rate bounded above, often grossly, by ct (or c~/ 2). For both uncorre-lated and pairwise families of comparisons, the B-H technique is shown to have greater power than the Hochberg or Bonferroni procedures, and its power remains relatively stable {{as the number of}} comparisons becomes large, giving it an increasing advantage when many comparisons <b>are</b> involved. <b>We</b> recommend that results from NAEP State Assessments be reported using the B-H technique rather than the Bonferroni procedure. Two questions often asked about each of a set of observed comparisons are: (a) should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> about the direction or the sign of the corresponding underlying population comparison, and (b) for what interval of values should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> that it contains the value for the population comparison?
