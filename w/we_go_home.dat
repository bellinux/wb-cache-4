500|$|Diplo {{explained}} to Interview magazine that the song's composition happened {{while they were}} drinking one night in the studio. There he played Madonna a Japanese pizzicato melody and a drop, which she liked. Since Madonna preferred to start her compositions on guitar, Diplo added guitar sounds over the melody and then progressed with the writing. Another Instagram post by Madonna confirmed Minaj's involvement in the track, with the photo caption [...] "We go hard or <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> we gon' do this all night long! #werk". Madonna commented about her method working with Minaj: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We don't drink, we don't smoke, {{and we are}} {{actually}} in love and happily married. We love our little girl, <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to each other at night, and we believe in what we are doing.|$|E
2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday {{night at}} Reading Festival 2010 and closed Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We want to have some fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E

60|$|This cost Tom and {{me three}} or four hours. Lieut.-Colonel Ferguson joined us as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and dined at Abbotsford.|$|R
2500|$|Richie {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with This Morning that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is [...] "going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps." [...] At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, [...] "We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will {{do the right thing and}} Tommy will be reunited with Kat." [...] Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was [...] "just doing her job". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> It's drama, that's it." [...] She also praised Womack's acting and vowed to move on to [...] "bigger and better things" [...] after she departed. She added: [...] " [...] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{a good deal about}} our affairs of late, and {{have come to the conclusion}} that the sooner <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would walk}} to the school with you, {{if you wish to}} see her. My aunt will be glad to hear of her, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to-morrow.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{you promised}} {{to show me}} all the {{different}} rocks and soils as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> {{because it was so}} dark when we came from Reading.|$|R
60|$|We saw {{the splendid}} review, {{we saw the}} white-moustached old Crimean soldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing, and then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|THE WIFE. These people {{treat us}} {{as if we were}} dirt beneath their feet. I wonder at you putting up with it, Amby. It would serve them right if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> at once: wouldnt it, Eth? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't believe it," [...] said Jonas. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with a tale {{like that}} we'll hear the recruiting-drum from Newark to Texas, and, ten to one, I'll be drafted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George," [...] said Rollo, as {{they walked}} along, [...] "we are going {{directly}} by the Capitol Hill as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Let us go in now and see the Dying Gladiator." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{struck the}} Holy One--we saw it! Our cattle will be barren--our wives {{will cease to}} bear! The snows will slide upon us as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home...</b> Atop of all other oppression too!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> to the joiner's {{and ordered}} the coffin, and the doctor had a glass of whisky on it; the {{graveyard}} fees were paid, and the doctor sealed the engagement with a drop of brandy; the vicar's port completed the doctor's joviality, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> on {{the evening}} train. Ted and Una came to the station with us, and Una said she would write me {{when she got to}} Japan, and Ted said he would be obliged to us forever and ever.|$|R
60|$|After that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and in {{due course}} Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good arrived for dinner, the latter arrayed in the {{tightest}} and most ornamental dress-suit I ever saw. I remember that the waistcoat was adorned with five pink coral buttons.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> we {{will take}} little Owen with us,' said Honor, kindly. 'It is high time he was taken from Little Whittington-street. Country air will soon make a different-looking child of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Charles. Yes, I'm sure I have. My basket's most full; {{and if we}} [...] hurry, {{we shall}} get ever so many before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> So pick away as [...] fast as you can, Emily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "you shall tell me as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> It {{is time to}} be {{starting}} home, it will take us three hours to get there. Hendrika, Hendrika, bring the horses here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' said Captain Cadurcis. 'So very spiritual! Plantagenet said to me, as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> {{the first}} night, {{that he looked}} like a golden phantom. I think him very like you, Venetia; indeed, {{there can be no doubt}} you {{inherited}} your face from your father.' ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>we</b> heard singing, {{and went}} into the porch of the schoolhouse to listen. A {{fisherman}} entered and told us to go in. It was a psalmody class. One of the girls had a glorious voice. We stayed for half an hour.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the father}} of cinematographer Peer Bode (<b>We</b> Can't <b>Go</b> <b>Home</b> Again).|$|R
6000|$|... 'He can't {{object to}} our living at half the cost, and {{getting out of}} debt; I'll talk him over when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Hunt is as fine a fellow as I ever saw, and as steady as old time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those fellows {{are going}} to get supper," [...] said Randy, [...] "and I move <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and do likewise. We can't learn {{anything}} more standing here, and if we went to the door and showed ourselves those men might get very suspicious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] he resumed, [...] "you will {{remember}} that I made arrangements {{to be away}} a year, if necessary, and perhaps if I {{make the most of}} my opportunities in this country, I may have something worth while to say when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> again." ...|$|E
5000|$|June 2012: [...] "Apopse den pame spiti" [...] (<b>We</b> won't <b>go</b> <b>home</b> tonight) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> and Matteo found {{waiting for}} him a message from Checco, bidding him leave the inn and take up his {{quarters}} {{with me at the}} Palazzo Orsi. On arriving, we found Checco excitedly walking up and down a long corridor lined with statues and pictures.|$|R
5000|$|... "Inchworm": [...] "We were in {{the studio}} {{for the first half}} of the year and we had a setback when we lost a member, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> for a little bit but when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>we</b> made sure we weren't going to be complacent, so I {{recorded}} this. I set up and just played this one riff and just altering the source material of that same riff and just working with this loop, and this was like a two-hour jam with a dancey-type vibe. The key to it was to translate that as a band and John Stanier added that reggaeton beat and Ian Williams brought in all his bass lines and that song was a really successful under pressure-type song that I think is really important for the scope of the album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{what a day}} of {{happiness}} it will be when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> again!" [...] cried Rose. [...] "Pray write to your friend at once," [...] she added, addressing Lomaque, [...] "and say we take the house, before any one else is beforehand with us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, why {{the name}} didn't ye tell us 'twas {{going to be}} a serious kind of thing before? How should I know what folk mean if they don't say? Now, shall we come in, or shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and come back along in a couple of hours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not till <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> I think,' said Cilla, with a blush; and, as if {{to avoid}} farther discussion, she bade Honora good night. Decidedly, she wished Robert to feel more than {{she would like to}} see, or should he betray no feeling, she had rather not be aware of it.|$|E
2500|$|Edmonds: When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> of course, they {{understood}} {{and they said}} {{not to worry about}} it. And our uncle helped us get a lawyer, Mr. Horace Meldahl in Charleston, who was a very understanding person, a nice person. He told us that <b>we</b> had to <b>go</b> back to school every morning for a while.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Darling,' he said, humbly, 'you're a wonder! What {{will they}} say about this at home?' He did pause here for a moment, for it took nerve to say it; but then he went right on. 'Mary, how would it be if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> right away--first train tomorrow, {{and showed it to}} them?' ...|$|R
60|$|After dessert was over, Ada and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{up to the}} nursery, {{leaving the}} gentlemen over their wine, and I believe they would have sat and talked there all night if Ada had not at last sent them message after message to say that tea was ready upstairs. Soon after they came up our fly arrived, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> very much pleased with our evening.|$|R
