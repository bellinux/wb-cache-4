50|$|From Hergiswil station the Brünig line {{runs through}} the Lopper I tunnel, under a {{shoulder}} of Mount Pilatus, to Alpnachstad, which is {{the starting point of}} the Pilatus Railway. The two lines are of different gauges, and there is no track connection. From Alpnachstad station, the Brünig line follows the Sarner Aa and Lake Sarnen to Giswil. Beyond Giswil station, the line's first rack section then allows the line to climb to Kaiserstuhl station. From here, the {{runs through the}} upper basin of the Sarner Aa and alongside Lake Lungern as far as Lungern. This is the steepest adhesion <b>worked</b> <b>section</b> of the line.|$|E
50|$|After Lungern station, {{a second}} rack section lifts {{the line to}} its summit at Brünig-Hasliberg station in the Brünig Pass. Beyond the pass, the line descends its third and final rack section, down the steep side of {{the valley of the}} Aare, to Meiringen. This is the steepest rack <b>worked</b> <b>section</b> of the line. At Meiringen station, the Brünig line reverses {{direction}} with trains both entering and leaving the station from the west end. The Meiringen-Innertkirchen Railway (MIB) connects here, leaving the station from its eastern end. Although there is a track connection between the two lines, they are electrically incompatible, and no through trains operate.|$|E

Probability estimates are included for certain lightning strikes (peak currents of 200, 100, and 50 kA) applicable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, during rollout, on-pad, and boost/launch phases. Results of an extensive literature search to compile information on this subject are presented in order to answer key questions posed by the Space Shuttle Program Office at the Johnson Space Center concerning peak lightning current probabilities if a vehicle is hit by a lightning cloud-to-ground stroke. Vehicle-triggered lightning probability estimates for the aforementioned peak currents are still being <b>worked.</b> <b>Section</b> 4. 5, however, does provide some insight on estimating these same peaks...|$|E

This project debrief is {{presented}} as review of the practices that <b>worked</b> (<b>Section</b> II.) practices that failed (Section III.) and practices that will be considered if the project were to be repeated (Section IV.). Finally the general principles and best practices are considered (Section V.). The motivation for this work was to articulate and capture the general research project management lessons learned as a guide for future project design and work ethic. This is a personal account meaning that the applicability of the practices are relative to my experience and working style. Before the research project I was a trained software engineer with four years of practical work experience in industry. The research project was completed in the field of Computational Intelligence, a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence with strong themes of abstraction information processing and empirical simulation. The general work ethic involved an approximate 50 -hour workweek and explicit separation of work from personal with regard to both physical location and activities undertaken [Introduction]...|$|E

Given multiple reference papers as input, the task aims {{to generate a}} related <b>work</b> <b>section</b> for a target paper. The gen-erated related <b>work</b> <b>section</b> {{can be used as}} a draft for the author to complete his or her final related <b>work</b> <b>section.</b> We propose our Automatic Related Work Generation system called ARWG to ad-dress this task. It first exploits a PLSA model to split the sentence set of the giv-en papers into different topic-biased parts, and then applies regression models to learn the importance of the sentences. At last it employs an optimization frame-work to generate the related <b>work</b> <b>section.</b> Our evaluation results on a test set of 150 target papers along with their reference papers show that our proposed ARWG system can generate related work sec-tions with better quality.
