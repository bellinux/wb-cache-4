25|$|Allochiria {{is often}} {{confused}} with alloesthesia, {{also known as}} false allochiria. True allochiria {{is a symptom of}} dyschiria and unilateral neglect.

25|$|Some {{knowledge-based}} engineering projects experienced similarly {{that there}} is a trade-off between trying to teach programming to a domain expert versus getting a programmer to understand the intricacies of a domain.

25|$|Determining <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{the seal}} should face up may {{be done in}} a number of ways: if there is a carving on top, the front should face the user; if there is an {{inscription}} on the side, it should face {{to the left of the}} user; if there is a dot on the side, it should face away from the user.|$|E

25|$|In {{a forward}} though, the spread in {{exchange}} rates is not trued up regularly but, rather, it builds up as unrealized gain (loss) depending on <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the trade being discussed. This means that entire unrealized gain (loss) becomes realized {{at the time}} of delivery (or as what typically occurs, the time the contract is closed prior to expiration) - assuming the parties must transact at the underlying currency's spot price to facilitate receipt/delivery.|$|E
25|$|After E. Kirby Smith's {{surrender}} of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, Gordon went with Jo Shelby {{and some of}} his officers and men to Mexico. These men could not decide on <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the war between the imperial forces of Maximilian I of Mexico and republican forces led by Benito Juárez. Gordon soon decided to return to Missouri, sparing him some of the difficulties encountered by Shelby and his men before those who had not died during the time in Mexico returned.|$|E
5000|$|To make a direct-to-disc recording, musicians would {{typically}} {{play one}} 15-minute [...] "live" [...] {{set in a}} recording studio per LP side using professional audio equipment. The recording was made without multitrack recording and without overdubs. The performance was carefully engineered and mixed live in stereophonic sound.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a coordinate system is the identification of points on a line with real numbers using the number line. In this system, an arbitrary point O (the origin) is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point P {{is defined as the}} signed distance from O to P, where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the line P lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1947, many of {{the tribes}} did not know to <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the border they belonged. On 17 August, the {{publication}} of the Radcliffe Award put the CHTs in Pakistan. The rationale of giving the Chittagong Hill Tracts to Pakistan was that they were inaccessible to India and to provide a substantial rural buffer to support Chittagong (now in Bangladesh), a major city and port; advocates for Pakistan forcefully argued to the Bengal Boundary Commission that the only approach was through Chittagong.|$|E
25|$|From 'No advantage'. Scoring method {{created by}} Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles {{team to win}} four points wins the game, {{regardless}} of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.|$|E

25|$|Ideological {{disputes}} {{were also}} widespread. Israel had been initially recognized {{by both the}} United States and the Soviet Union. For {{the first three years}} of its existence, Israel was in the Non-Aligned Movement, but David Ben-Gurion gradually began to take sides with the West. The question of <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Cold War Israel should choose created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even had Marxist members leave. The disillusionment particularly set in after the Slánský trial in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried.|$|E
25|$|In arithmetical terms, the Cantor set {{consists}} of all real {{numbers on the}} unit interval that are expressible as a ternary (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. It further follows that the Cantor set has a bijective mapping with the set of infinite binary sequences.|$|E
25|$|Hell Station {{had to be}} rebuilt, and the old station {{building}} was moved to Sunnan Station. Controversies arose over the location of Skatval Station, Levanger Station, Verdal Station, Sparbu Station, with the initial discarding of Mære Station, and Steinkjer Station. The line through Steinkjer was controversial, as the proposal would split the town in two, {{and there was an}} intense debate as to <b>which</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river the station should be built on. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen—and thus avoid the town itself—was discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port.|$|E
