A full interchange will be constructed between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road; the intersection with the former <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a cul-de-sac {{on both sides of}} the expressway. Further north, a partial-access diamond interchange will be built at Downey Road/ Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.|$|E
5|$|The Pleasure Beach Bridge is a movable Warren through-truss {{bridge in}} Bridgeport, Connecticut. Completed in 1927, it {{functioned as a}} toll bridge until the Great Depression, when it was {{transferred}} to the city of Bridgeport. Its service life came to an end after it was badly damaged by fire in 1996, cutting off access to Pleasure Beach. In the decade following the fire, several bonds to fund a new bridge were proposed, but ultimately fell through. Pleasure Beach has become the subject of debate, whether it <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> undisturbed protected salt marsh or be revitalized. An alternate method of access via water taxi service, first made possible by a grant in 2009, was not realized until 2013.|$|E
5|$|Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that <b>Will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

5|$|Whitney gets {{a job as}} a {{teaching}} assistant at Walford Primary School. During one breaktime, she warns Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles) not to run in the playground. He ignores her and falls over, grazing his arm. Whitney does not react in the professional manner she is supposed to, causing Dennis's injury to be ignored. When Dennis's mother, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer Johnny Carter (Sam Strike), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), hope that Johnny and Whitney <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> item, but his sister Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.|$|E
5|$|Xi Telescopii is an {{irregular}} variable star that ranges between magnitudes 4.89 and 4.94. Located 1079 light-years distant, it {{is a red}} giant of spectral type M2III that has a diameter around 5.6 times the Sun's, and a luminosity around 2973 {{times that of the}} Sun. Another irregular variable, RX Telescopii is a red supergiant that varies between magnitudes 6.45 and 7.47, just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing conditions. BL Telescopii is an Algol-like eclipsing binary system that varies between apparent magnitudes 7.09 and 9.08 over a period of just over 778 days (2 years 48 days). The primary is a yellow supergiant that is itself intrinsically variable. Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9.6 to 16.5, RS Telescopii is a rare R Coronae Borealis variableâ€”an extremely hydrogen-deficient supergiant thought to have arisen {{as the result of the}} merger of two white dwarfs; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012. The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by the star. As of 2012, four dimmings have been observed. PV Telescopii is a class B-type (blue) extreme helium star that is the prototype of a class of variables known as PV Telescopii variables. First discovered in 1952, it was found to have a very low level of hydrogen. One theory of its origin is that it is the result of a merger between a helium- and a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, the former will accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> extreme helium star before cooling to become a white dwarf.|$|E
25|$|When two vowels {{come into}} contact across morphemes, the cluster is {{simplified}} to one vowel. Gemination, the repetition of the same vowel, results in that vowel. Any vowel followed by an /i/ <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> /i/. /u/ + /a/ <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> /u/, and /a/ + /u/ <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> /a/. Heath {{was not able to}} acquire enough data to determine a rule for /i/ + /a/ or /i/ + /u/, and only the underlying triple-vowel sequence /uai/, which becomes an /i/, was observed out of all possible three-vowel combinations.|$|E

25|$|Normal swing occurs mostly {{when the}} ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the {{aerodynamics}} of the asymmetry change and {{it is more difficult}} to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very oldâ€”around 40 or more overs oldâ€”it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as reverse swingâ€”meaning a natural outswinger <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> inswinger and vice versa. In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, but here the seam causes the airflow to separate earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.|$|E
25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twinsâ€”76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
