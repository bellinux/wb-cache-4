25|$|Broadchurch {{creator and}} writer Chris Chibnall {{described}} {{the project as}} a labour of love. He {{spent more than a}} decade in the United Kingdom working on various television programs, and initially conceived Broadchurch about 2003 while working on his first series, Born and Bred. The concept <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> how a child's murder affects a small, close-knit community, and how the characters react to the media attention and the mutual suspicion that arises.|$|E

After Alice had recovered, the Le Plongeons made a short excursion to Uxmal.|$|E
25|$|Japanese Canadians {{tried to}} resist the forced sale of their properties. At an {{internment}} camp in Kaslo, BC, Japanese-Canadian property owners formed the “Japanese Property Owners’ Association” with branches at other internment camps across BC.

The claim was delayed in courts until August 28, 1947, and in the meantime, approximately $11.5 million worth of Japanese-Canadian property had been sold for just over $5 million.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, the ACMAA library {{partnered with}} the {{libraries}} of the Kimbell Art Museum and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth {{to create the}} Cultural District Library Consortium (CDLC). The purpose of the consortium <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> new ways of sharing {{the resources of the}} three Fort Worth institutions via online public access. In 1998, with technical assistance from the library at Texas Christian University, the three museums launched an online CDLC catalog that allows website visitors access to the combined collections of all three art museum libraries. Today, the CDLC catalog also gives access to the libraries of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT).

25|$|Mircea Eliade's {{earliest}} works, most {{of which}} were published at later stages, belong to the fantasy genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 Cum am găsit piatra filosofală, showed its adolescent author's interest in themes that he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> throughout his career, in particular esotericism and alchemy. Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the philosophers' stone. These early writings also include two sketches for novels: Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii ("The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants") and Memoriile unui soldat de plumb ("The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier"). In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for satirical commentary. Eliade himself explained that Memoriile unui soldat de plumb was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, abiogenesis, human evolution, and the entire world history.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian government's {{financial}} involvement {{represented a}} shift in the expedition's emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies. In a letter to the Canadian Victoria Daily Times, Stefansson set out these separate aims. The main object <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the [...] "area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between Alaska and the North Pole". The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted. While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist Rudolph Anderson would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s Tippett {{worked on a}} series of {{compositions}} that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: The Shires Suite (1970), The Knot Garden (1970) and the Symphony No. 3 (1972). [...] In The Knot Garden Mellers discerns Tippett's [...] "wonderfully acute" [...] ear only intermittently, otherwise: [...] "thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience". The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a direct quotation from Beethoven's finale. Tippett's intention, explained by the music critic Calum MacDonald, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in Schiller's Ode to Joy, as set by Beethoven. [...] Tippett's conclusion is that while the need to rejoice remains, the twentieth century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.|$|E

500|$|Conceived as a [...] "show about nothing," [...] {{in which}} the main {{characters}} would [...] "just make fun of stuff", Seinfeld said {{that the idea of}} the pilot episode <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the [...] "gaps in society where there are no rules." [...] The storyline, as well as most of the main characters, were inspired by the personal lives of its creators. Jerry was a fictionalized version of Seinfeld, George a fictionalized version of Larry David and Kessler was based on David's neighbor Kenny Kramer. Though Seinfeld was initially concerned the [...] "wacky neighbor" [...] would be too much of a cliché, David convinced him to put the character in the script. However, anticipating that the actual Kramer would exploit the benefits of having a TV character based on him, David hesitated to call the character Kramer. Thus, in the pilot, the character's name was [...] "Kessler". However, intrigued by the name, Seinfeld was convinced that the character's name should be Kramer, prompting Kenny Kramer to call NBC's legal department with various financial and legal demands, most of which he received. The name inconsistency would eventually be corrected in the season 9 episode [...] "The Betrayal" [...] in which Kramer explains that Kessler is the name on his apartment buzzer.|$|E
