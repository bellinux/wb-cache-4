He earned extra money to fund a bicycle upgrade by working as a newspaper boy.

Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by <b>watching</b> <b>and</b> listening to episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses {{when they are}} presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E

5|$|The Matanikau River area {{included}} a peninsula called Point Cruz, {{the village of}} Kokumbona, {{and a series of}} ridges and ravines stretching inland from the coast. Japanese forces used the area to regroup from attacks against U.S. forces on the island, to launch further attacks on the U.S. defenses that guarded the Allied airfield (called Henderson Field) located at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, as a base to defend against Allied attacks directed at Japanese troop and supply encampments between Point Cruz and Cape Esperance on western Guadalcanal, and as a location for <b>watching</b> <b>and</b> reporting on Allied activity around Henderson Field.|$|E

5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then <b>watching</b> <b>and</b> snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E

5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords <b>watching</b> <b>and</b> cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|Romford {{formed a}} chapelry {{in the large}} ancient parish of Hornchurch in the Becontree hundred of Essex; {{as well as the}} town it {{included}} the wards of Collier Row, Harold Wood, and Noak Hill. Through ancient custom the area enjoyed special status and a charter in 1465 removed the parish from the Becontree hundred and the county of Essex and it instead formed the independent liberty of Havering. Over time the vestry of Romford chapelry absorbed the local powers that would usually be held by the parish authorities and in 1849 Romford became a separate parish within the liberty. Improvement commissioners were set up in 1819 for paving, lighting, <b>watching,</b> <b>and</b> cleansing of the marketplace and main streets. As the town grew this arrangement became ineffective at controlling sanitation and in 1851 a local board of health was set up for the parish; although its area was reduced in 1855 to cover only the town ward. The remainder of the parish became part of the Romford rural sanitary district in 1875. These changes and the introduction of the Romford Poor Law Union in 1836 eroded the powers of the liberty and it was finally abolished in 1892 and reincorporated into Essex.|$|E
