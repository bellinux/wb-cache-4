5|$|Combining {{elements}} of death metal, thrash metal, black metal, progressive metal and industrial music, Strapping Young Lad's music {{was characterized by}} the use of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, blast beats and Wall of Sound production.

At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, <b>were</b> <b>major</b> forces in British rock in subsequent years.|$|E

Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President <b>were</b> <b>major</b> steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
