Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS, including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting <b>wiggler</b> built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk. Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting <b>wiggler,</b> for the BMIT beamline.

Many characters, such as Wario, had already appeared in the game's predecessor and several other Mario spin-offs, while {{this was the first}} appearance for <b>Wiggler</b> as a playable character. All of the characters are categorised into six groups that reflect their playing style: all-around, technical, power, speed, defensive, and tricky. Inherent in each character is a set of two unique moves known as [...] "Power Shots". These powerful moves, which are accompanied with an animation each time they are triggered, incorporate the character's specific qualities. They can only be triggered occasionally in the match, but will usually result in defending or scoring a point, {{depending on the type of}} shot chosen. Generic tennis moves, such as slices, dropshots, and lobs, can be applied at any time in the match.|$|E

This method of calculation is based on certain properties of the Fourier transform. It allows the analytical expression of the Fourier transform for the planar magnetic fields through the <b>wiggler's</b> geometry and magnetization of its blocks. The upper theoretical limit for the amplitude of the magnetic field is derived and matched with the field amplitude of planar <b>wigglers</b> with standard designs. The property of universality for planar <b>wigglers</b> is also taken into consideration as it may greatly simplify the analysis of magnetic fields for <b>wigglers</b> with different designs...|$|R

50|$|The first {{suggestion}} of a <b>wiggler</b> magnet to produce synchrotron radiation was made by K. W.

40|$|Absorption of {{synchrotron}} radiation (SR) power generated by <b>wigglers</b> of damping rings {{is a difficult}} technical task. The CLIC damping ring operates with electron (or positron) beams with energy 2. 424 GeV, average beam current is up to 150 mA. The 38 <b>wigglers</b> installed in one straight section of the CLIC damping ring produce radiation with a total power of about 122 kW. Power density {{at the end of}} the straight sections is about 75 W per square mm. Such a power density can destroy vacuum chambers, therefore a careful design and placement of appropriate radiation collimators and absorbers is required. In this paper we describe an algorithm to compute SR power density as well as options for safe absorption of SR power. All the calculations were performed for the current design of the CLIC damping ring and <b>wigglers.</b> Some related problems for absorption of high SR power are described...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinearities {{from any}} {{periodic}} magnet in accelerators may strongly degrade {{the dynamics of}} the beams. This may be especially critical for magnets where the beam excursions are comparable to the good field region, as for example in <b>wigglers,</b> since the beam trajectory can be of the order of the pole width. A general method based on alternately shifting the magnetic axis of each pole to compensate this effect was proposed and applied to the DAΦNE <b>wigglers,</b> where an important integrated octupole was measured. This approach has been optimized by multipolar analyses and the effect on the beam dynamics verified by tracking studies. In this paper we report about the experimental validation of the magnetic model and the verification of the method by beam based measurements. The latter were performed after all the <b>wigglers</b> in the DAΦNE main rings had been modified according to the optimal configuration.
