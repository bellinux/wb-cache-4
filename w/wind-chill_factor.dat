50|$|On January 3, 1982, the Bengals beat Buffalo, 28-21, in an AFC Divisional Playoff game. A week later, {{playing in}} their first AFC Championship Game, the Bengals {{defeated}} San Diego, 27-7, at Riverfront Stadium in a temperature of nine degrees below zero with a <b>wind-chill</b> <b>factor</b> of minus-59. This game {{is referred to as}} the Freezer Bowl.|$|E
50|$|However, the eventual-AFC Champion Cincinnati Bengals, {{playing in}} their first AFC Championship Game, {{defeated}} the Chargers 27-7 in {{what became known as}} the Freezer Bowl. The temperature of −9° with a <b>wind-chill</b> <b>factor</b> of −59° made this the coldest weather conditions for a title game in the history of the NFL. Chargers owner Eugene Klein tried to get the NFL and Bengals to postpone the game but he was turned down.|$|E
50|$|Windstopper is {{the third}} of the three Shell Layer levels and is {{completely}} windproof, eliminating the <b>wind-chill</b> <b>factor</b> on the golf course. Windstopper has two layers made of expanded and porous e-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). An ultra thin protective layer is laminated to a lightweight textile layer to create a microporous structure. These micropores are 900 times larger than a water vapour molecule, which allows for perspiration {{to escape from the}} inside. The Windstopper membrane is characterized by its thermoregulatory function that prevents overheating, but keeps the body up to 2.5 times warmer than comparable materials.|$|E
50|$|The Snow Bowl {{was played}} on December 1, 1985, against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The {{game was played}} in a record snowfall, with {{a foot of snow}} on the field, and four more inches falling during the game. It was nearly delayed, as the tarp {{protecting}} the field was frozen to the ground, and could not be removed until shortly before kickoff. The 35-mph wind produced a <b>wind-chill</b> <b>factor</b> of zero. According to an employee who had been to every Packer home game in their history, it was the worst weather ever at Lambeau Field. The attendance of 19,856, and the 36,586 unused tickets, were the lowest in both Buccaneer and Lambeau Field history. The Packers gained 512 yards to the Buccaneers' 65, as Tampa Bay lost their 18th consecutive road game.|$|E
5000|$|The weather {{constrained}} {{the wind}} farm's construction for the teams from contractor McNicholas and German turbine supplier Nordex. During the final stages, the {{project manager for}} McNicholas was quoted as saying: The weather has undoubtedly been the single biggest challenge we have faced up here. We have worked with wind speeds well in excess of 120mph and temperatures as low as minus 12 degrees Celsius, which is more like minus 25 with the <b>wind-chill</b> <b>factor.</b> I've worked {{on a lot of}} wind farm construction projects but the adverse conditions have made this {{one of the most difficult}} ... We have spent £30,000 on personal protective equipment for the workers. Keeping them warm, fed and moving in these conditions is a massive man management project, but we did it. The wind farm, which stretches across nearly 2 mi of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, was officially opened on 25 September 2008. and was at that time the largest onshore wind farm in England.As of 26 August 2008, 21 of 26 turbines had been commissioned and 4,000 MW·h of electricity had been exported to the National Grid. The turbines are visible from south Manchester, [...] away, and are expected to produce enough electricity to meet the needs of 40,000 average homes. Scout Moor has the capacity to produce a total of 65 MW, compared with the 90 MW capacity of Kentish Flats, the United Kingdom's largest offshore wind farm. The total cost of the Scout Moor project was £50 million, but Peel Holdings expect the turbines to be in operation for at least 25 years. Since its opening, the wind farm [...] "has become a real tourist attraction"; a calendar showing photographs of the wind farm's construction has been featured in local news stories.|$|E
