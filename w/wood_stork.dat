5|$|Dark-plumaged {{immature}} birds may {{be confused}} with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while the pale plumaged adults could feasibly {{be confused with}} the <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> although the latter's long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E

5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
25|$|Eastern bongos, pink-backed pelicans, and Egyptian geese {{are found}} in a center pen that is spacious and tree-shaded. This exhibit has become a home for a large {{breeding}} colony for the highly endangered <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> native to Florida.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{features}} {{several species}} of parrots, owls, and raptors, {{as well as a}} wetland aviary. Birds at the zoo include scarlet macaw, jabiru, great egret, <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> brown pelican, ornate hawk-eagle, harpy eagle, common black hawk, king vulture, spectacled owl, barn owl, mottled owl, yellow-headed amazon, white-fronted amazon, collared aracari, and great curassow.|$|E
50|$|There are roseate spoonbills, snowy egrets, and <b>wood</b> <b>storks.</b> Marine animals include redfish, snapper, mackerel, black drum, snook, trout, and amberjack.|$|R
50|$|Dome swamps {{also provide}} {{breeding}} habitat for rare {{animals such as}} flatwoods salamanders (Ambystoma spp.), white ibis (Eudocimus albus), and <b>wood</b> <b>storks</b> (Mycteria americana).|$|R
50|$|The swamp habitat also {{provides}} for threatened and endangered species, such as red-cockaded woodpeckers, <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> indigo snakes, gopher tortoises {{and a wide}} variety of other wildlife species.|$|R
25|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} {{systems have}} shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the Everglades in Florida {{are used as}} breeding sites {{for a number of}} birds, including the endangered <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria americana). Stormwater treatment ponds can provide important breeding habitat for amphibians, especially where natural wetlands have been drained by human development.|$|E
25|$|The maguari stork (Ciconia maguari) {{is a large}} {{species of}} stork that inhabits {{seasonal}} wetlands over much of South America, and is very similar in appearance to the white stork; albeit slightly larger. It is the only species of its genus {{to occur in the}} New World {{and is one of the}} only three New World stork species, together with the <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> and the jabiru.|$|E
25|$|This stork has a {{markedly}} broad {{diet and}} {{is considered to be}} a generalist compared to the sympatric <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> and jabiru. It feeds on fish, frogs, eels, earthworms, invertebrates, insect larvae, snakes, freshwater crabs, small mammals such as rats, and bird eggs. More rarely, it may take smaller birds; as one case has shown where a large, intact rail was discovered in the gullet of an individual from Patagonia. Despite the maguari stork's apparently generalist diet, one study from Brazil has suggested that this stork may actively target worm lizards Amphisbaenae as prey items. This may be because of the elongated body shape of such taxa that occupies a relatively small volume in the bird's stomach and hence can more compactly fit inside the stomach to optimise the bird's energy intake.|$|E
50|$|The back {{section of}} the park {{contains}} a large bird rookery, where free-roaming local birds species such as egrets, herons, <b>wood</b> <b>storks</b> and roseate spoonbills nest and rear their young.|$|R
5000|$|Central Region: Sandhill cranes, <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> cattle, white-tailed deer, feral hogs, wild turkey, bobwhite quail, river otters, alligators, Red Widow spider, Florida pine snake, black bears, and gopher {{tortoises}} are all {{found in}} the Central Region.|$|R
50|$|The lagoons are {{a feeding}} area for {{hundreds}} of waterfowl including <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> endangered jabiru storks, black-bellied whistling ducks, sandpipers, and others. Many of the birds use the sanctuary as a transmigration point during their seasonal journeys.|$|R
25|$|Breeding {{is highly}} {{synchronised}} {{with the onset}} of rain during the wet season, which usually lasts from May to November in the llanos of Venezuela. However, most breeding of the maguari stork happens from July to mid-September, which is earlier than breeding in both the sympatric <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> and the jabiru. Individuals begin migration to the breeding grounds as the rains begin, although some individuals may migrate and arrive early just before the rains. Despite the lengthy wet season in the llanos, the nesting period in one year never lasts for over four months. Elsewhere in the stork's global range, the timing of the breeding season is slightly different and somewhat shorter. In north east Argentina for example, the breeding season extends from June to August; and in east central Argentina extends from July to October, with eggs probably being laid in late June and early July. On Isla Mexiana in eastern Brazil, the breeding season lasts only from August to September. The timing of onset of the seasonal rain is extremely variable across the maguari stork's global range, with rainfall beginning in some years as early as late March and others as late as June. The start of breeding is therefore correspondingly variable; and in Argentina, nesting may commence as late as August with late rains. In the llanos, breeders may lay eggs as early as late May following unusually early and heavy rainfall; whereas young breeders may lay eggs as late as October with late-arriving rain.|$|E
500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in this zone is dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E
500|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} in mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks with the glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in flooded fields, and the two species select different food items with little overlap; the former foraging for crabs and aquatic insects and the latter feeding mainly on grain. The <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> {{is also found in}} the same habitat in Florida, but hunts larger prey and a higher percentage of fish, so there is little overlap. In the Llanos, where American white ibis coexist with the scarlet ibis, their diets differ, the former consuming more bugs, fish and crustaceans, while the latter eat a much higher proportion of beetles. The willet (Tringa semipalmata) has been observed trailing American white ibis and catching prey disturbed by them, and even kleptoparasitizing (stealing) from them, in J. N. [...] "Ding" [...] Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island in Florida. An isolated event of [...] predation in juvenile American white ibis has been observed, where a juvenile attacked and consumed a chick from another nest.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{wildlife}} {{of the park}} are white-tailed deer, bobcats, and river otters. There are many birds in the park, including bald eagles, falcons, and hawks, as well as egrets, <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> white ibis, wild turkeys, and herons.|$|R
50|$|The bays are {{especially}} rich in biodiversity, including some rare and/or endangered species. Species that {{thrive in the}} bays' habitats include birds, such as <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> herons, egrets, and other migratory waterfowl, mammals such as deer, black bears, raccoons, skunks, and opossums.|$|R
50|$|The NFSLR {{contains}} mainy {{federal and}} state protected species, including American alligators, manatees, North American river otters, nesting <b>wood</b> <b>storks,</b> little blue herons, brown pelicans, snook and opossum pipefish. The NFSLR also contains rare tropical peripheral fish species, including gobies, sleepers, and pipefish.|$|R
2500|$|The maguari stork {{lives in}} sympatry with jabiru and <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> where the ranges {{of these three}} species overlap, {{especially}} in the Venezuelan llanos. [...] Of all American stork species, the maguari stork has the smallest geographical range.|$|E
2500|$|Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge holds {{hundreds}} of species of animals including birds, fish, plants, and mammals. [...] The wetlands of Pelican Island {{are a major}} ecological system supporting the huge biological diversity. [...] Fifteen federally listed threatened and endangered species live in Pelican Island NWR and around Indian River Lagoon. [...] Of the endangered species, West Indian manatees and sea turtles occupy parts of the lagoon. [...] Around the lagoon in the refuge are two <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> refuges. [...] These birds along with other wading birds that nest on the island thrive on the tremendous fish population. [...] Pelican Island is home to many nesting birds including brown pelicans, great egrets, snowy egrets, reddish egrets, great blue heron, little blue heron, tricolored heron, black-crowned night heron, American white ibis, glossy ibis, double-crested cormorant, anhinga, and American oystercatcher.|$|E
2500|$|What is now Everglades National Park {{was created}} in 1947, and is {{recently}} as 1998, {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the most endangered national park in America." [...] Some of the environmental issues facing the Everglades are, disrupted water flow, a drastic decline in the wading bird population, invasion of exotic species and the survival challenges facing the Florida panther, of which there are only 160 left in the wild, an increase from 20 wild Florida panthers in the 1970s. Additionally, species such as the <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> the Cape Sable seaside sparrow and the manatee have an uncertain future in the Everglades as a result of environmental issues. [...] Former Secretary of Friends of the Everglades, Sharyn Richardson said that she got started with the organization, attracted by its philosophical ideals, stating, [...] "when you see an injustice and you become aware of that injustice, you have to take responsibility for it." ...|$|E
50|$|The ACE Basin NERR is {{intended}} to protect the natural environment, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area.

2500|$|This {{relatively}} large stork stands at 97–120cm tall and {{is similar in}} size to the congeneric white stork. It is intermediate in size between the smaller <b>wood</b> <b>stork</b> and the larger jabiru, the two other stork species with which the maguari stork exists in sympatry {{in some parts of}} its range. Much of the adult plumage is white, with black flight feathers and a forked blacked tail. This forked tail is shorter than the stiff white undertail coverts, so that these protrude from underneath the tail and may function aerodynamically in flight. The forked tail clearly distinguishes the maguari stork from the white stork, [...] and is easily seen in flight through the white undertail coverts by an observer from the ground. During flight, this stork offers an impressive sight. It soars at least a hundred metres above the ground with an outstretched neck and extended legs, intermittently beating its broad wings to gain momentum for long glides. It flaps its wings at a rate of 181 beats per minute and the wingspan measures 150–180cm. This stork needs to give three long jumps before it can take off from the ground.|$|E
