Owing to a week's premature rains the ground was all flooded when I returned, and the plants just coming into ear were yellow and dead. Not a grain would be obtained by the whole village, but luckily it is only a luxury, not a necessity of life. The rain was the signal for ploughing to begin, in order to sow rice on all the flat lands between us and the town. The plough used is a rude wooden instrument with a very short single handle, a tolerably well-shaped coulter, and the point formed of a piece of hard palm-wood fastened in with wedges. One or two buffaloes draw it at a very slow pace. The seed is sown broadcast, and a rude <b>wooden</b> <b>harrow</b> is used to smooth the surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{conception}} of industrialization {{in reference to}} agriculture of six North-Western Gubernyias being a considerable part of the Taken Lands, has quite different dimension than in other sectors of partitioned Poland. Using two terms – industrialization of agricultural production and employment of modern methods of increasing this production – is more adequate here. The 1890 s {{and the beginning of}} the 20 th century are the years of intensive development in using new tools and agricultural machines in Polish manors, where <b>wooden</b> <b>harrows</b> and primitive ploughs had been still used in the 1870 s, but at the turn of the 19 th century, multiple furrow ploughs, cultivators, reaping machines, mowers and steam-threshers occurred. Many landlords invested money in alcohol distillery, increasing potatoes raising. Growing specialization of agricultural production can be clearly seen – Belorussian Gubernyias were the second in the production of milk and its products in European part of Russia. The reasons of this big modernizing development, as for the borderlands gubernyias, lie mainly in the falling profitability of traditional corn-growing and in the eagerness of Polish landlords for increasing profits from their properties...|$|R
