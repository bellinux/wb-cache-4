The 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade issued orders in the morning of 10 June to the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse). At [...] on 11 June, the attack toward Cheux was ordered to begin as soon as possible that day. The commander of the 1st Hussars had no time conduct a reconnaissance with the R Group (a reconnaissance group composed of attached arms, an artillery representative and the squadron leaders) and then complete an appreciation of the situation before issuing orders; the squadron commanders would have then issued detailed orders to the troop leaders. The 6th CAR tried to get ready, [...] "In the morning we were told <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>moving</b> at [...] Sunday 11 June.
