40|$|Abstract: SPKI/SDSI is a {{framework}} that combines a simple public-key infrastructure and a simple distributed security infrastructure with a means of defining local name spaces. It allows principals, {{which can be a}} person or an organization, to locally create groups of principals and delegate rights to other principals or groups of principals by issuing certificates. To prove authorizations, principals need to search for necessary certificates that are, in general, in the form of certificate trees. This paper defines {{a framework}} based on SPKI/SDSI which allows principals to give <b>weights</b> to <b>certificates.</b> <b>Weights</b> can be used to address many authorization issues such as access control of limited resources. The paper shows a connection between SPKI/SDSI and the theory of pushdown systems, and presents an algorithm that solves the authorization problem by computing minimum-height certificate trees. ...|$|R

Dispensing systems for individual syringes preparation are preferably based on direct radioactivity determination using dose calibrators: in this case the dose calibrator is the critical component, whose calibration status need to be verified during OQ (see below). One more example of critical components in dispensing systems are the pumps often used to draw / push fluids through tubing assemblies; again, a verification of their calibration (e.g. by measuring dispensed volumes with a reference precision balance) should be performed during OQ; v) a verification of data backup and restore.|$|R
50|$|However, even if Filipina {{women do}} not have an NNEB background, many women {{received}} degrees through various universities in the Philippines. These women “even {{go so far as to}} draw equivalency between a university degree in Canada and one from the Philippines”. Thus, these Filipina women have high educational statuses behind them and have every means to be at par with European women who have NNEB status. However, this is not the case as differentiation through ethnicities takes hold again. It seems that “nanny agents display an odd forgetfulness about Filipinas’ educations while assigning the NNEB <b>certificate</b> <b>weight</b> and importance”.|$|R

Within its traditional character, classification of ships was made against class rules developed by the societies themselves and based upon routine, annual and special surveys. Notwithstanding the <b>weight</b> of these <b>certificates</b> in the insurance market, they have never been considered to be conclusive evidence of the vessel’s seaworthiness (The Toledo [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 40) but rather as supporting evidence to the owner’s due diligence in providing a seaworthy ship under the Hague and Hague-Visby Rule...|$|R
40|$|Cities are {{responsible}} for 70 % of greenhouse gas emissions, {{as well as the}} depletion of agricultural land and natural resources. The sustainable urban design can achieve the required balance, in addition to measuring convergence with sustainable development and the possibility of dealing with long term urban problems. It also encourages community participation by involving people in the design process through its various stages, and asks them to contribute to decision-making, which represents one of the foundations of collective action in creating sustainable urban design. The vision {{of this paper is to}} clarify the concept of sustainability assessment of urban design. The analysis of current situations is based on a critical review and comparison among six assessment tools from the UK, USA, Japan, Portugal, UAE and Qatar. The study focuses on finding out the strengths, weaknesses, the content use, <b>weighting,</b> scoring, <b>certificates</b> rating and context of the assessment tools. The findings of this study suggest that the existing assessment tools focus on environmental issues; and some extent social issues of sustainable urban design, while economic indicators are not emphasized in any of the tools, with ambiguity in the mechanism of local adoptions and community participation...|$|R

The following year, he earned his BCRPA Fitness Knowledge certification and a BCRPA <b>Weight</b> Room Instructor <b>certificate.</b> In 1994, O'Toole competed at the British Columbia Bodybuilding Championships where a scoring error gave the initial light heavyweight class win to another competitor. This decision was reversed by the organization a few weeks later, but only the class win could be reversed and not the overall competition, which all those present including guest poser Dennis Newman had assumed would go to O'Toole ...|$|R
40|$|Positivstellensatz is a {{fundamental}} result in real algebraic geometry providing algebraic certificates for positivity of polynomials on semialgebraic sets. In this article Positivstellensätze for trace polynomials positive on semialgebraic sets of n× n matrices are provided. A Krivine-Stengle-type Positivstellensatz is proved characterizing trace polynomials nonnegative on a general semialgebraic set K using weighted sums of hermitian squares with denominators. The <b>weights</b> in these <b>certificates</b> are obtained from generators of K and traces of hermitian squares. For compact semialgebraic sets K Schmüdgen- and Putinar-type Positivstellensätze are obtained: every trace polynomial positive on K has a sum of hermitian squares decomposition with weights and without denominators. The methods employed are inspired by invariant theory, classical real algebraic geometry and functional analysis. Procesi and Schacher in 1976 developed a theory of orderings and positivity on central simple algebras with involution and posed a Hilbert's 17 th problem for a universal central simple algebra of degree n: is every totally positive element a sum of hermitian squares? They gave an affirmative answer for n= 2. In this paper a negative answer for n= 3 is presented. Consequently, including traces of hermitian squares as weights in the Positivstellensätze is indispensable...|$|R
40|$|Birth {{weight and}} risk of renal cell cancer. BackgroundThe {{prenatal}} period has been suggested to be important for future cancer risk. Conditions in utero are also important {{for the development of}} the kidney, and birth weight, a marker of fetal nutrition and growth, is linearly correlated with the number of nephrons and the structural and functional unit of the kidney. An association between birth weight and renal cell cancer, the major form of kidney cancer, is biologically plausible, but has never been studied. MethodsWe conducted a population-based, case-controlled study in Sweden of men and women aged 20 to 79 years. We collected self-reported information on categories of birth weight from 648 patients with newly diagnosed renal cell cancer and from 900 frequency-matched control subjects. We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) as estimates of the relative risks. ResultsAn increased risk of renal cell cancer was observed among men with a birth weight of ≥ 3500 g (adjusted OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI, 1. 0 to 1. 8) compared with men with a birth weight between 3000 and 3499 g, especially in the subgroup without hypertension or diabetes (adjusted OR = 1. 8, 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 2. 6). No clear association among men with a birth weight < 3000 g or among women was found. ConclusionsOur study shows that conditions in utero, reflected by birth weight, might affect the risk of renal cell cancer in adulthood. It is unclear why no association was found among women. Further studies, based on <b>weight</b> from birth <b>certificates,</b> are needed to clarify this relationship...|$|R
