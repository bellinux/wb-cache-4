2500|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, the Four Tops focused on touring and live performances. They {{recorded}} only one album, returning again to Motown for 1995's Christmas Here <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>On</b> June 20, 1997, 59-year-old Lawrence Payton {{died as a}} result of liver cancer, after singing for 44 years with the Four Tops who, unlike many Motown groups, never had a single lineup change until then. At first, Levi Stubbs, Obie Benson, and Duke Fakir toured as a trio [...] called The Tops. In 1998, they recruited former Temptation Theo Peoples to restore the group to a quartet. By the turn of the century, Stubbs had become ill from cancer; Ronnie McNeir was recruited to fill the Lawrence Payton position and Peoples stepped into Stubbs' shoes as lead singer. Stubbs later died on October 17, 2008 at his home in Detroit.|$|E
2500|$|E.V.Ramasamy {{was clear}} about {{the concept of a}} {{separate}} multi-linguistic nation, comprising [...] Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada areas, that is roughly corresponding to the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. The proposition was made with a view to safeguarding the national self-respect of Dravidians threatened by Indo-Aryan culture, language, political leadership, and business interests. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu. With the promised grant of full self-government after World War II, and posed another threat to the Indian Freedom Movement However, it failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress. By the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy supported Muslim League's claim for a separate Pakistan, and expected its support in return. In an interview with the Governor of Madras, Jinnah, the main leader of Muslim League, said that India should be divided into four regions: Dravidistan, Hindustan, Bengalistan and Pakistan; Dravidistan would approximately consist of the area under the Madras Presidency. Jinnah stated [...] "I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and you establish Dravidistan where the 7 per cent Muslim population will stretch its hands of friendship and live <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> lines of security, justice and fairplay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked {{controversy}} in December 2013 {{during an interview}} with the Al-Ahed website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: [...] "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan , although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: [...] "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, {{and at the same time}} too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". [...] "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," [...] Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf [...] "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: [...] "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: [...] "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might disagree <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> political matters, but personally have [...] fondness for you, because of your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on. If such a person were to say that he or she liked someone, then all hell would break loose".|$|E

2500|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduces}} [...] "Pro Mode" [...] to the Rock Band franchise {{for both}} guitar and bass players, where players finger specific strings and frets instead of colored buttons in Easy to Medium mode, while on Expert mode players {{are required to}} play the actual guitar chords and solos, note for note. [...] Two completely new guitar controllers were developed for use in this mode - both of them legitimate MIDI guitars. The first one MadCatz created {{was based on the}} bass version of the Fender Mustang, featuring 105 buttons each representing every spot possible on the neck up to 17 frets, and a [...] "string box" [...] where the player strums strings, it was made of plastic and can be a step up from the legacy five lane controllers. [...] The second takes an authentic, actual Squier Stratocaster guitar by Fender, the complete guitar with strings and up to the standard 22 frets, added a [...] "string box" [...] near the strumming area for hit detection, and rebuilt the neck to have a fret-sensing feature in order to tell the game where the player's fingers are on the fret board. [...] There is also a [...] "mute bar" [...] built into the guitar which can be raised or lowered; in the raised position the strings of the guitar are softly muted so as to not ring out. [...] This mute bar is what allows the string box to detect and translate individual string hits for the game. [...] In the lowered position, the guitar strings wont be muted and therefore lets the strings ring out for normal guitar playing outside of the Rock Band game. [...] Tuning this specialized guitar is not necessary for playing Rock Band, as for the game the guitar functions in MIDI mode and the guitar's sound comes from sound files of the actual guitar playing in the songs painstakingly designed from audio master stems of each song for the game. [...] Both of these officially made MIDI guitars utilize Pro Mode, allowing for accurate fingering while playing with the added effect of learning how to play the song for real on guitar, either alone or with friends playing the song <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> any other instrument or controller, even online. [...] Of the two Pro guitars, only the MadCatz Mustang model - with 105 buttons - was capable of playing [...] "legacy" [...] (5-lane) guitar or bass charts. The Mustang was the first available unit, with the Squier becoming available in March 2011.|$|E
