500|$|In 1919 Major {{taught at}} the Stephen A. Douglas Elementary School, the same school she had {{attended}} as a child. In his biographic sketch of 1927 her husband noted {{that it was a}} distinctive honor to be appointed school clerk since [...] "95 per cent of the teachers were non-Aframerican." [...] She left the teaching profession in 1923 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> moved to Manhattan. She later said she found herself with nothing to do in New York and was [...] "positively miserable" [...] until 1925 when she participated in a fund raising effort for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Early in March of that year she composed and distributed a public announcement for the annual NAACP Dance in Harlem's Manhattan Casino. The release, which appeared in the New York Age on March 7, led to the job offer that would prove to be the starting point for her career in journalism.|$|E

500|$|Those {{who knew}} Stone well thought {{her voice was}} lacking strength. In August <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> Harry wanted {{to take part in}} more {{meetings}} at the Exposition, she was too weak to go. Stone was diagnosed as suffering from advanced stomach cancer in September. She wrote final letters to friends and relatives. Having [...] "prepared for death with serenity and an unwavering concern for the women's cause," [...] Lucy Stone died on October 18, 1893, at the age of 75. At her funeral three days later, 1,100 people crowded the church, and hundreds more stood silently outside. Six women and six men served as pallbearers, including sculptor Anne Whitney, and Stone's old abolitionist friends Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Samuel Joseph May. Mourners lined the streets for a sight of the funeral procession, and front-page banner headlines ran in news accounts. Stone's death was the most widely reported of any American woman's up to that time.|$|E

Margaret's slave Joshua was put in charge of the carpentry to build her a new house. [...] Nancy, Margaret and sister Antoinette devoted their time to activities in Grand Cane's Concord Baptist Church, of which they were founding members. She continued to be a wife who was happiest <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> stayed close to home. Although she accompanied him to President Andrew Jackson's Tennessee funeral in the summer of 1845, she did not attend fetes held in her husband's honor by his old friends and supporters. During the latter part of the year, Antoinette's husband William died, followed a few months later by the death of Vernal's wife Mary. Prior to her death, she had elicited a promise from Margaret to assume the trusteeship of Virginia Thorne.|$|E
500|$|In August 1940, the Duke and Duchess {{travelled}} {{by commercial}} liner to the Bahamas, where the Duke was installed as Governor. Wallis performed {{her role as}} the Bahamas' first lady competently for five years; she worked actively for the Red Cross and in the improvement of infant welfare. However, she hated Nassau, calling it [...] "our St Helena", in a reference to Napoleon's final place of exile. She was heavily criticised in the British press for her extravagant shopping in the United States, undertaken when Britain was enduring privations such as rationing and the blackout. Her attitude towards the local population, whom she called [...] "lazy, thriving niggers" [...] in letters to her aunt, reflected her upbringing. In 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill strenuously objected <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> planned to tour the Caribbean aboard a yacht belonging to a Swedish magnate, Axel Wenner-Gren, who Churchill said was [...] "pro-German". Churchill felt compelled to complain again when the Duke gave a [...] "defeatist" [...] interview. Another of their acquaintances, Charles Bedaux, who had hosted their marriage, was arrested on charges of treason in 1943, and committed suicide in jail in Miami before the case was brought to trial. The British establishment distrusted the Duchess; Sir Alexander Hardinge wrote that her suspected anti-British activities were motivated by a desire for revenge against a country that rejected her as its queen.|$|E

During this trip, she experienced open-air markets, produce stands, and fresh cooking ingredients for the first time. Upon returning to the U.S., she began to cultivate her culinary abilities by studying the volumes of Julia Child's seminal cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.

2500|$|She {{said her}} Living Rooms project evolved from her {{examination}} of Fabiani's architecture both in Vienna and other cities. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> took {{possession of the}} building in Chicago that was their home {{they were given a}} set of floor plans for the structure. [...] The plans and inspiration from Fabiani led to a series of drawings and paintings she created during the decade from 2001 to 2011. [...] She made all the paintings at the same time, keeping them in view on the walls of her studio as her ideas evolved during the period of their creation. [...] Each is one seventh the size of the room it represents and all are abstracted dramatically by elimination of elements in the plans from which she worked and by inclusion of shapes that denote motion and light. Her intention was to use these marks to convey life as she experienced it in the rooms. [...] Describing them as [...] "acrobatic," [...] she aimed to activate the marks {{in the eye of the}} observer.|$|E
