Even though, new <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> have been set in hospital as well as in medicinal family centers, they are not being used as much. Medicinal pills are thrown in normal <b>waste</b> <b>disposals.</b> When medicinal pills stay for a long time without valid usage time, then they release dangerous substances for human’s health. The Municipal Family Medicine Center in Pristina releases 60 tons/year medicinal waste. Medicinal waste is found also in some pharmacies in Pristina. The central pharmacy of Pristina has declared 200 kg of medical waste. Other pharmacies have also reported medical waste, such as Agani Warehouse.|$|R

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the exhaust {{emission}} of <b>waste</b> plastic <b>disposal</b> fuel on single cylinder YANMAR diesel engine. The objectives of this report are to analyze the fuel consumption and the emission characteristic of a single cylinder diesel engine that are using <b>waste</b> plastic <b>disposal</b> fuel compared to usage of ordinary diesel that {{are available in the}} market. This report describes the setups and the procedures for the experiment which is to analyze the emission characteristics and fuel consumption of YAMNAR diesel engine due to usage of the both fuels. The experiment used diesel engine with no load which means no load exerted on it. Detail studies about the experimental setup and components have been done before the experiment started. Data that are required for the analysis is observed from the experiments. Calculations and analysis have been done after all the required data needed for the thesis is obtained. The obtained data indicated that the diesel fuel is better than <b>waste</b> plastic <b>disposal</b> fuel in term of fuel consumption, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2). By the end of the report, the successful of the project have been stated which is YANMAR engine is able to run with <b>waste</b> plastic <b>disposal</b> (WPD) fuel but the engine needs to run by using diesel fuel first, then followed by <b>waste</b> plastic <b>disposal</b> fuel and finished with diesel fuel as the last fuel usage before the engine turned off...|$|R

The reaction is started by producing copper(II) fluoride with a charged metal reactor that contained copper oxide and then adding HF at high temperatures from there it is exposed to benzene and fluoroaromatics take place causing the formation of fluorotoluene or fluorobenzene or some other fluorinated benzene derivative. This enables fluoroaromatics to be done in large scale quantity without the <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> of the current fluorination processes.|$|R
