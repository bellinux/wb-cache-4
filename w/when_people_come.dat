Amphilochius of Pochayiv (in world Yakiv Holovatyuk 1894 - 1971) {{was born}} on November 27, 1894 in the village Mala Ilovytsya, in Shumsk raion of Ternopil oblast in western Ukraine. In 1925 he became a monk and joined the {{community}} of Pochayiv Lavra. In 1936, Amphilochius {{had been given the}} rank of hieromonk (priest-monk). His healing gifts attracted the attention of many people. Archimandrite of Lavra blessed the monk in this work and allowed him to settle in a little hut near the cemetery. In the summers, the pilgrimage to Amphilochius (then called father Joseph) was increasing, reaching 500 people daily. On the 11 / 12 May 2002, he was canonized by the Orthodox Church after the church commission researched his life. Just before Easter his relics were uncovered fully intact.

The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>come</b> up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>come</b> out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

2500|$|Christians will {{sometimes}} {{point out that}} in their points of view, the wrongdoings of other Christians are not the fault of their religious scriptures but {{of those who have}} wrongly interpreted it. They posit that the mistakes of Christians do not refute the validity of their teachings, but merely proves their weakness and sinful nature, of which they then turn to Christ. Thus, according to them, the [...] "Word of God" [...] can still be true and valid without it having been accurately followed. According to Ron Sider, an Evangelical theologian, [...] "The tragedy is that poll after poll by Gallup and Barna show that evangelicals live just like the world. Contrast that with what the New Testament says about what happens <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>come</b> to living faith in Christ. There's supposed to be radical transformation {{in the power of the}} Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17, 1 Cor 10:13). The disconnect between our biblical beliefs and our practice is just, I think, heart-rending." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} sparked {{debate among}} biologists and primatologists on whether gorillas and other primates {{should be held}} in captivity at all. Primatologist Jane Goodall said that according to the video it seemed Harambe was {{trying to protect the}} child. Goodall later issued a longer explanation {{in an interview with the}} president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, concluding that the zoo had no choice but to kill Harambe. She wrote, [...] "It was awful for the child, the parents, Harambe, the zoo, the keepers and the public. But <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>come</b> into contact with wild animals, life and death decisions sometimes have to be made." [...] Goodall said that as long as humans and wild animals are kept in close proximity in zoos, there is no way to prevent accidents from happening, but she believed that zoos [...] "with the highest standards of care" [...] could play an important role. Zookeeper Jack Hanna strongly defended the zoo's actions as the [...] "correct decision", noting that a tranquilizer dart might have taken five or ten minutes to take effect and could have aggravated Harambe further. Primatologist Frans de Waal said he saw few options for the zoo: [...] "A gorilla is so immensely strong that even with the best of intentions—and we are not sure that Harambe had those—the child's death was a probable outcome.” ...|$|E
