25|$|Womack and {{her husband}} are best friends with Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> to kiss his sister.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{served as}} regent of the Netherlands {{so well that}} Charles forced her to retain the post and granted her more powers than their aunt had enjoyed. Unlike her aunt, Mary was deeply unhappy during her tenure as {{governor}} and never enjoyed her role. In May 1531, having governed for only four months, Mary told her brother Ferdinand the experience <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> a rope around her neck. While Margaret had been considered truly feminine, flexible, adaptable, humorous and charming, Mary was unyielding and authoritarian. Margaret accomplished her goals using a smile, a joke, or a word of praise, but Mary used cynical and biting comments. Unlike her aunt, Mary was unable to forgive or forget. She recognized this lack of [...] "power as a woman" [...] as her main problem.|$|E
500|$|Occasionally, Kraft {{intervened in}} order to ensure that his {{conception}} of the flight director's authority was maintained. By the time that the Apollo 7 mission flew, he had been promoted to head of the flight operations division; thus, it was Glynn Lunney who served as lead flight director and had to deal directly with behavior by the crew that Kraft considered [...] "insubordinate". As Kraft commented in his memoirs, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> a ringside seat at the Wally Schirra Bitch Circus." [...] Mission commander Wally Schirra, annoyed by last-minute changes in the crew's schedule and suffering from a bad cold, repeatedly refused to accept orders from the ground. Although Schirra's actions were successful in the short term, Kraft decreed in consultation with astronaut chief Deke Slayton that none of the Apollo 7 crew would fly again. However, Schirra had decided before the flight that he would retire after Apollo 7.|$|E

500|$|Achieving Darla's {{look was}} a {{struggle}} for Benz. She said: [...] "Taking that makeup off, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> six layers of skin ripped off your face every time. It was miserable and the contact lenses were terrible. I don’t wear contacts and I don’t know how people do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If she’s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, she’s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz {{points out that in}} the Buffy pilot episode, Darla—attempting to dress like a high school student—exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where she was a little more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E
500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar. [...] The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. [...] "Without a bank, we didn’t have a movie," [...] Lee explained. [...] "But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> a back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|All-Pro {{defensive}} tackle Roger Brown appeared in five Playoff Bowls, the most by any player, {{and was on}} the winning side each time (Detroit Lions, 19606162; Los Angeles Rams, 1967, 1969). He said playing in those seemingly meaningless contests <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> [...] "the worst inferiority complex."

2500|$|In the 1980s, wineries in New Zealand, {{especially}} in the Marlborough region, began producing outstanding, some critics said unforgettable, Sauvignon blanc. [...] "New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is like a child who inherits {{the best of both}} parents—exotic aromas found in certain Sauvignon blancs from the New World and the pungency and limy acidity of an Old World Sauvignon blanc like Sancerre from the Loire Valley" [...] (Oldman, p.152). One critic said that drinking one's first New Zealand Sauvignon blanc <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> sex for the first time (Taber, p.244). [...] "No other region in the world can match Marlborough, the northeastern corner of New Zealand's South Island, which seems to be the best place in the world to grow Sauvignon blanc grapes" [...] (Taber, p.244).|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, Guillermo del Toro {{signed on}} as {{executive}} producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>having</b> our own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E
