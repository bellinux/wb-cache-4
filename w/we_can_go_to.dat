6000|$|... "Yes'm. We don't have to; but we wanter, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{the circus}} that's comin' to-morrer. He made his'n ketchin' trout; so he's helpin' me," [...] {{explained}} the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Holiday. [...] "We shall sail {{directly}} by it {{in going to}} the head of the lake, and if we stop there <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> it very easily." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> all <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the villain's lair today.|$|R

3000|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> our {{operator}} L {{and establish}} the following regularity results, differentiating twice the representation formula: [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have a {{guide in}} the matter of their taste," [...] said James. [...] "We can see what Wright's are doing--and Jordan's--and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hathersedge and Knarborough and Alfreton--beforehand, that is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go to Virginia Water in it," [...] said Jone, [...] "and when we {{come back}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. I made a mistake, but I've got to stand by it or be called a greenhorn." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he said: [...] "The {{best place}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> is to bed. If {{we can get}} some sleep in this wood, now {{everyone}} has cleared out of it, it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> in <b>to</b> the others. Remember what I {{told you}} about omitting the first seven pages. The society won't stand {{introductory}} remarks in a thesis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} honour of {{personal}} acquaintanceship with Mlle. Lange. An {{you care for}} an introduction <b>to</b> her, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> round <b>to</b> the green room after the play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were on our}} way to Hope Seminary. I suppose <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> around <b>to</b> the Upper Road, but it will be four or {{five miles}} out of our way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, we can {{get into}} the omnibus," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "and go {{directly}} up to Lausanne, or <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the hotel here, and take lodgings, and then go up to Lausanne to see the town after dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eugenio's our courier. He doesn't like to {{stay with}} Randolph; he's the most fastidious man I ever saw. But he's a splendid courier. I guess he'll stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the castle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend Basil Grant," [...] I said, [...] "is {{the best}} man <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to.</b> He and I were to {{have gone to the}} same dinner tonight; but he will just have come back by now. Have you any {{objection}} to taking a cab?" ...|$|E
50|$|At this point, we are {{finished}} with a model asset. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> shot production. There are various steps for shot production and {{they are based on}} what was created already.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll <b>go</b> direct <b>to</b> the Outlook Hotel," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "And then, if we can't {{find out}} anything about father, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> down <b>to</b> {{the offices of}} Pelter, Japson & Company in the morning." ...|$|R
3000|$|... ‘So we {{take the}} bike, we go up there since there are cycling tracks. They’re safe so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> the {{playground}} by bike. And they can ride.’ (Mother, two children, area 3) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "See? It ain't no use," [...] said Legget, {{spreading}} out his hands, [...] "Let him go. He'll outwit the bordermen if any redskin's able to. The sooner he goes the quicker he'll git back, an' <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work. You ought'er be satisfied to git the girl----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say. I wouldn't be {{astonished}} if they did. Anyhow, I'm dead {{played out}} and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep, because dad and Webster mean {{to sit up}} all night. I don't know whether you noticed that the coffee pot was on the stove and dad had his cigar box out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Softly, softly, child!" [...] said Thumb. [...] "It is {{only your}} giddy eyes rolling. What's more," [...] he said, pretending to laugh, [...] "those old hairy Men of the Mountains, {{even if only}} Meermuts, must have come from somewhere.

6000|$|... "That's right, my dear," [...] the Duchess said, smiling, [...] "stick up {{for your}} countrymen. I suppose he'll find us {{sometime}} during the evening. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> all <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the theatre together; the omnibus is outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll try {{to think}} of a place that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> at the seaside." [...] Having said those words she slowly moved away to the door, and turned back, remembering the packet of letters. She took it up, paused, and looked toward the window. The streets still {{interested}} him. She left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or, if {{you don't}} {{choose to go}} so far in a day," [...] {{continued}} Rollo, [...] "you can go in half a day {{to the entrance of}} the valley, where there {{is a good place to}} stop, and then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Chamouni the next day. I have studied it all out in the guide book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, Corny," [...] said Guert, {{rising and}} {{stretching}} his fine frame like a lion roused from his lair, [...] "here's off. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Ravensnest to sleep, to-day; and, to-morrow {{we will work}} our way out into the highway, and fall into the line of march of the army. I shall have another opportunity of seeing Mary Wallace, and of telling her how much I love her. That will be so much gained, at all events." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, see 't y' do. I can't do it; I've got {{bread to}} mix an' a chicken to dress. Say, if you don't begin cuttin' till day after to-morrow, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> down <b>to</b> the sociable to-morrow night. Last one o' the season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she exclaimed, {{coloring}} a little. [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> that, now." [...] He did not insist, and {{she said}} presently, [...] "I thought the sailors had a superstition about ships that are lucky and unlucky. But you've kept your boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{raise him}} up, an' you needn't {{be careful about}} lettin' him drop. The sooner {{he gets to the}} bottom the quicker <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the store. Put the bundles near the mouth of the shaft, an' {{in a couple of days}} {{somebody}} will find him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is capital," [...] Hector said. [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work. We need {{carry this}} crowbar no farther. In {{the first place}} we will cross this roof and other roofs {{as far as we}} can go; the sentry at the corner is {{probably}} standing up for shelter in a doorway, and we may as well get {{as far as we can}} from him, and at the same time not go far enough to get near the one at the next corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true {{that the}} race is a bad one, and the {{circumstances}} show what injury a set of false notions, transmitted from father to son, for generations, may do in a family. We cannot think of keeping these dear girls here, one hour after to-morrow, Hugh. To-morrow, or to-day, for it is now past two o'clock, I see;--to-day is Sunday, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church; to-night we will be watchful, and Monday morning your uncle shall start for Satanstoe, with all three of the girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," [...] {{looking from}} the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. [...] "It is an {{excellent}} plan to have some place where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> further <b>to</b> {{establish}} the centrality c(.) {{as an extension}} of the eigenvector centrality to groups of nodes along broadly similar lines as those advocated by Everett and Borgatti. To introduce the main result here, we need to present the (intuitive) definitions of union and intersection of subgraphs.|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} whether a potential node is a viable scapegoat, we need to check its α-weight-balanced property. <b>To</b> do this <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the definition: size(left) <= α*size(node) size(right) <= α*size(node)However a large optimisation {{can be made by}} realising that we already know two of the three sizes, leaving only the third having to be calculated.|$|R
3000|$|To get the PAPR {{distribution}} in this case, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> let N <b>go</b> <b>to</b> infinity in Equation 21; then, we obtain the following formula: [...]...|$|R
