2500|$|He {{has written}} and spoken {{publicly}} {{about the fact}} that, despite past scepticism, he believes the Earth's climate is warming {{in a way that}} is cause for concern, and that this can likely be attributed to human activity. He summed up his thoughts at the end of his 2006 documentary [...] "Can <b>We</b> <b>Save</b> Planet Earth?" [...] as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2016 interview, guitarist Jon Hudson {{stated that}} he has been [...] "working on a few ideas" [...] for the next Faith No More album, and added that [...] "it's {{something}} that [...] wanted to focus on after the tour ended." [...] When asked about the prospect of more music from Faith No More, Patton told Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I don't know whether or not we're going to attack it, but there is some stuff we wrote {{around the time of the}} last one and said, 'Why don't <b>we</b> <b>save</b> this for the next record?'. So we'll see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinicians {{have responded}} that they are unwilling to {{consider}} the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is [...] "far-riskier" [...] than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, [...] "I don't know anyone who offers women the option of doing nothing." [...] Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis {{is the fact that it}} is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that [...] "even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating all these women, <b>we</b> <b>save</b> a bunch of lives". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{seven years}} after Shahak's death, the {{controversy}} of religious interpretation continued when Rabbi Shmuley Boteach doubted the veracity of Shahak's report of Jewish injustice against a non-Jew: [...] "From the beginning, the story was curious. What prohibition could there possibly be, in allowing someone else to use one's phone on the Sabbath?" [...] In support, he cited Eli Beer, the chief coordinator of Israel's volunteer ambulance service (1,100 medical personnel, 60 per cent Orthodox), who said, [...] "If someone would say we won't save a non-Jewish life on the Sabbath, he is a liar. If he is Jewish, Christian, or Muslim <b>we</b> <b>save</b> everyone's life on {{any day of the}} year, including the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, and I have done so myself. Indeed, as an Orthodox Jew it is my greatest honor {{to save the life of}} a non-Jew, and I would violate any of the Jewish holy days to do so." ...|$|E
60|$|So then, it remaineth that I show you, FIRST, How <b>we</b> are <b>saved</b> by {{the grace}} of the Father. SECOND, How <b>we</b> are <b>saved</b> {{by the grace}} of the Son. And, THIRD, How <b>we</b> are <b>saved</b> {{by the grace of}} the Spirit.|$|R

2500|$|In Lévy's 1988 paper [...] "", {{he defines}} {{a notion of}} optimal sharing, such that no work is duplicated. For example, {{performing}} a beta reduction in normal order on (λx.xx) (II) reduces it to II (II). The argument II is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, <b>we</b> <b>save</b> work because work is not duplicated: (λx.xx) (II) reduces to (λx.xx) I. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on (λf.f I) (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) yields (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) I, (λx.xx) (II) which we know we can do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields (λf.f I) (λy.y I (y I)), (λy.y I (y I)) I, I I (I I), and now work is duplicated.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Gabriel!--and are you? I {{have come}} about them. The weather awoke me, and I {{thought of the}} corn. I am so distressed about it--can <b>we</b> <b>save</b> it anyhow? I cannot find my husband. Is he with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will even}} answer the mighty earl [...] That asked of Wessex men [...] Why they be meek and monkish folk, [...] And {{bow to the}} White Lord's broken yoke; [...] What sign have <b>we</b> <b>save</b> blood and smoke? [...] Here is my answer then.|$|E

60|$|Still, <b>we</b> <b>saved</b> quite {{a number}} of {{household}} articles. Some things we broke and some we forgot, and some things were too big to move in this way; but we did very well, considering the circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|... "We met by hazard," [...] said Sybil, {{in a calm}} tone, {{and with}} an {{expression}} that denoted {{she was thinking of}} other things, [...] "and in all probability we shall never meet again. Talk not of these trifles. Stephen; my father, how can <b>we</b> <b>save</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't {{our place}} to run after you," [...] said the medical man, picking {{a thread of}} cotton from his purple sleeve. [...] "Why should <b>we</b> <b>save</b> you in particular? You see--from one point of view--people with imaginations and passions like yours have to go--they have to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our over-keenness," [...] {{returned}} Edgar, [...] "was not right, perhaps, but our {{course of}} action was quite legitimate--for {{it is a good}} turn done not only to ourselves but to the world when <b>we</b> <b>save</b> property; and the salvor of property--who necessarily risks so much--is surely worthy of a good reward in kind." ...|$|E
50|$|On the {{way back}} to town, Rela slips and nearly drowns. <b>Wes</b> <b>saves</b> her life. Ashamed of his ways, Wes offers to ride back to town {{alongside}} Rela to turn himself in to the law and accept his fate.|$|R
60|$|Going into Cairo, we {{came near}} killing a {{steamboat}} which {{paid no attention}} to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows. By doing some strong backing, <b>we</b> <b>saved</b> him; which was a great loss, for he would have made good literature.|$|R
6000|$|... "An' it's jes' as well," [...] Bob replied hoarsely, as {{a volume}} of flame burst from the companion-way. [...] "Nothin' less than a {{fire-engine}} would do any good now. It's time <b>we</b> <b>saved</b> what'll be needed ashore. Knock off, Joe, an' we'll load the raft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will make}} no difference," [...] Boldero said. [...] "In that case {{we will make}} off with him alone. Everything else will go on just the same. Of course, I should be very sorry not to save the girl; but, {{as far as we}} are concerned, if <b>we</b> <b>save</b> the father it will answer our purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{were not}} crabs, but {{lobsters}} and crawfish," [...] remarked the mermaid. [...] "They are very intelligent creatures, and {{by making them}} serve us <b>we</b> <b>save</b> ourselves much household work. Of course, they are awkward and provoke us sometimes, but no servants are perfect, it is said, so we get along with ours {{as well as we}} can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; not so. Your {{duty and}} mine are the same,--as should be hers. We must forget {{ourselves}} while <b>we</b> <b>save</b> the family. Do not I bear all? Have not I borne everything--contumely, solitude, ill words, poverty, {{and now this}} girl's unkindness? But even yet I will not give it up. Take the property,--as it is offered." ...|$|E
60|$|To get the tallow or grease {{with which}} to make these rushlights, <b>we</b> <b>saved</b> the fat of the deer, or the bear, or even {{a portion of the}} grease from turkeys, and, having {{gathered}} sufficient for the candle making, mixed them all in one pot for melting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had better not, Bill. I have got sixpence. We will put that by, with the sixpence <b>we</b> <b>saved</b> the other day, for the hostler. We haven't given him {{anything}} for some time. Your eightpence will get us a good breakfast in the morning." ...|$|R
