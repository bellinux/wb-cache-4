5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> again.|$|E

In 1964, David M.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, {{the trade}} {{appeared}} to make some sense from the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.|$|E

[...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it...

500|$|Virginian {{newspapers}} praised Pickett's Virginia division {{as making}} the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success {{as a means of}} criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure. Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett's role in the battle. W. R. Bond wrote in 1888, [...] "No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting." ...|$|E

500|$|Feller began 1947 {{by setting}} up a barnstorming tour, pitting his own {{selected}} team against a Negro league baseball team led by Satchel Paige. Feller's team included Stan Musial and Phil Rizzuto while Paige's included Buck O'Neil and Hilton Smith. They played in 22 games across the United States, and {{at the conclusion of}} the tour, each player had made nearly as much money as the St. Louis Cardinals made as a team for their 1946 World Series win. Against the St. Louis Browns in Feller's second start of the season, he extended his major league record for one-hitters when he recorded his ninth one-hit game in a shutout win on April 22. In a June 13 game against the Philadelphia Athletics, having already amassed 10 strikeouts through four innings, Feller fell from the mound, which rain had made slippery, and injured his back. [...] "My fastball <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> after that", Feller said. He ended the season as the AL leader in wins (20) and shutouts (5), and led the majors in strikeouts (196) and innings pitched (299).|$|E

500|$|Rhodes {{believed}} that the 1903–04 tour {{was a turning point}} in his career as a bowler and that afterwards he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Part of the reason was a change in his bowling style. He had noticed that it was necessary for him to bowl faster in Australia to be effective, and on his return to England he continued with this faster style until the First World War. Rhodes thought that another reason for his relative bowling decline was the development of his batting which took up much of his time. [...] His biographer, Sidney Rogerson, speculates that further deterioration may have been caused by the strain of regular bowling on his fingers and wrist, and his more robust, muscular frame in his mid-twenties. Rogerson believes that Rhodes was affected by the break-up of the successful Yorkshire team which had peaked between 1900 and 1902. More batting responsibility was placed on his shoulders, and he received less support in the field as the team personnel changed. Consequently, Rhodes scored more runs and moved further up the batting order after 1903, but his bowling gradually declined until the war.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Greg Ryan, Keogh was [...] "unanimously {{regarded as}} the best back in the colony" [...] and also [...] "one of the most gifted, colourful and ultimately controversial figures of early New Zealand rugby." [...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators {{knew what he was}} going to do next. He was the first player to bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E
500|$|St Hill {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{successful}} black batsmen in West Indies. As a batsmen, St Hill's performances reached their highest standards on the biggest occasions and against the best bowlers. Although not possessing quick footwork, he was capable of quickly judging where the ball would land. This enabled him to get into position quickly gave him extra time to play shots, which he often delayed until the ball was very close to him. Many of his runs were hit behind point and square leg. St Hill's favourite stroke was the leg glance; the shot carried the risk of falling leg before wicket (lbw) if he missed but his placement was very precise. He also played a range of cut shots. If a bowler restricted his scoring, St Hill improvised attacking shots to break free. Learie Constantine wrote a description of an innings he saw St Hill play as a young man. Facing the fast bowling of George John, St Hill [...] "flicked his wrists and the ball flew to the boundary faster than sound. The next went the same way. The boy batted from his wrists; he never seemed to use any force. I don't believe he had the strength even if he so desired. His was just perfect timing." [...] However, he always insisted on playing his own style of game, whether he was in form or not. The result was often his dismissal without scoring many runs. This was the case in England in 1928. After 1926, St Hill <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> batsman and according to James was as likely to get out cheaply as he was to make a big score.|$|E
