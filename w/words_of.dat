Each activity, itself small and relatively unimportant, could escalate through <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth to create strong, positive brand images and beliefs. A major characteristic of chaos theory, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) is at work in <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. This paper reviews <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth literature from a chaos/complexity theory perspective. Using a multiple case study approach, the significance <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth in turbulent markets is assessed. It was found that more successful companies tended to use <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth proactively, and that it is an effective marketing tool for turbulent environments. Furthermore, chaos theory is shown as a good lens through which to view <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. This paper is important because <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth has had little attention from the academic community, with the exception of electronic or Internet based <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. Furthermore, it suggests an academic theory to underpin <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth that has not been considered before.
