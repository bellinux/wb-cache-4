We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Dan Houser of Rockstar Games {{said that}} {{despite what the}} general public might think, Rockstar likes to [...] "spend a bit of time" [...] {{at the end of}} {{projects}} before deciding what to do next. [...] "Basically we have been meaning to start [...] for a while, but we have limited bandwidth and limited studios, and more games to make than we've started. So suddenly it was a good slot," [...] Houser said, explaining why it took eight years to follow up [...] [...] "Also, contrary to a lot of people, we like to {{take a little bit of}} time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> in the next game." ...|$|E

[...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will see what we can do with Bully." ...|$|E
2500|$|After World War II {{broke out}} in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{returned}} Stimson to his post {{at the head of}} the War Department. The choice of Stimson, a conservative Republican, was a calculated effort by the president to win bipartisan support for what was considered an almost inevitable US entrance into the war. Ten days before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson entered in his diary the following statement: [...] " [...] brought up the event that we are likely to be attacked perhaps next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> The question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves." [...] During the war, Stimson oversaw a great expansion of the military including the conscription and training of 13 million soldiers and airmen, and the purchase and transportation of 30% of the nation's industrial output to battlefields [...] He worked closely with his top aides Robert P. Patterson (who succeeded Stimson as Secretary), Robert Lovett (who handled the Air Force), Harvey Bundy and John J. McCloy (Assistant Secretary of War).|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, Guillermo del Toro {{signed on}} as {{executive}} producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E
