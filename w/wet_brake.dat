40|$|The {{authors have}} {{reported}} that the micro wavy surface formed by machining combined with laser heat treatment have higher static coefficient of friction compared with the surface finished by polishing or cutting. Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify the surface formation mechanism {{in order to control}} micro wavy height and the influence of lubricant viscosity on static frictional force. In practical use, high viscosity lubricant is used in <b>wet</b> <b>brake</b> to prevent oil leakage. At cutting after laser heat treatment, when the higher thrust force was, the higher micro wavy height was obtained. Thus, decreasing cutting speed or increasing feed rate, the obtained micro wavy height became higher. The static coefficient of friction of surface finished by polishing was decreasing with lubricant viscosity. This tendency was also seen at micro wavy surface. However, the static coefficient of friction of micro wavy surface was constantly higher than polished surface regardless of lubricant viscosity. © 2011 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Increased machine {{performance}} through reduction of drivetrain power losses {{is an important}} goal in powertrain engineering. One key area of power loss in the driven axles of heavy on-road vehicles and off-highway vehicles is the disengaged <b>wet</b> <b>brake</b> conjunctions. The resultant power loss, particularly under cold start conditions, can be quite significant. The addition of patterned grooves into the brake friction linings assists lubricant flow to dissipate heat during contact, which complicates the prediction of performance, making design improvement a multi-variate problem. A Reynolds-based numerical model with the inclusion of lubricant inertial terms is developed, allowing time efficient prediction of the conjunctional torsional viscous losses. The numerical model is validated with CFD as well as experimental measurements, using a developed component based test rig. Good agreement is found for predictions against measurements for lower viscosity lubricant flow at higher bulk oil temperatures. The results show deviations at lower temperatures promoting higher viscosity inlet starvation, which is not taken into account with the assumed fully flooded inlet...|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain an}} insight to high humidity-caused {{friction}} modulation in brake pad-rotor interface, the adhesion phenomenon {{due to a}} liquid bridge is simulated using an advanced particle method by varying the shearing speed of the interface. The method, called generalized interpolation material point for fluid-solid interactions (GIMP-FSI), was recently developed from the material point method (MPM) for fluid-solid interactions at small scales where surface tension dominates, thus suitable for studying the partially <b>wet</b> <b>brake</b> friction due to high humidity at a scale of 10 m. Dynamic capillary effects due to surface tension and contact angles are simulated. Adhesion forces calculated by GIMP-FSI {{are consistent with those}} from the existing approximate meniscus models. Moreover, the numerical results show that capillary effects induce modulations of adhesion as slip speed changes. In particular, the adhesion modulation could be above 30 % at low speed. This finding provides insights into how the high humidity-caused friction could cause modulations of brake, which are unable to be achieved by conventional models. Therefore, the numerical analysis helps to elucidate the complex friction mechanisms associated with brakes that are exposed to high humidity environments...|$|E

5000|$|Examples of {{stick-slip}} can {{be heard}} from hydraulic cylinders, tractor <b>wet</b> <b>brakes,</b> honing machines etc. Special dopes {{can be added to}} the hydraulic fluid or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the stick-slip effect.

Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon include the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a stopping train. Stick-slip also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage. Another example of the stick-slip phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a glass harp by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass. One animal that produces sound using stick-slip friction is the spiny lobster which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head. Another, more common example which produces sound using stick-slip friction is the grasshopper.|$|R

40|$|This work {{is dealing}} with the {{investigation}} of sliding friction of elastomers on rough surfaces with regard to the application of passenger car tires <b>braking</b> on <b>wet</b> surfaces under ABS conditions. Other than with pure elastoplastic friction partners, with viscoelastic elastomers complex contact conditions appear which are influenced by the mechanical-dynamical moduli, sliding velocity and temperature. Since a long time known velocity dependent friction curves show a surface- and elastomer dependent maximum the reason for which is suggested diversely in literature (adhesion or hysteresis friction). The here chosen attempt consists of a quantitative description with a nowadays concept of hysteresis friction. Special attention lies on the influence of the geometrical surface roughness to the friction coefficient. In a laboratory experiment, velocity dependent friction curves are obtained on two silicon-carbide surfaces with different granulation and on a smoothed steel surface. Water and paraffine oils with different viscosity are used as lubricants. The braking distances obtained in outdoor <b>wet</b> <b>braking</b> tire tests under ABS conditions are mainly influenced of friction processes in the contact area.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in the friction coefficient to unacceptable levels for frictional brake pad applications in a rainy and humidly environment is considered as a serious problem as it influences {{the safety of the}} vehicle. Thus, in the present work, particular emphasize were given to the effect of water spray on the level and behaviour of friction and wear characteristics of frictional brake pad (FBP) materials. Four different non-commercial FBP materials (NF 1, NF 2, NF 4, and NF 5) were developed and evaluated along with other two chosen commercial FBP materials (CMA and CMB) using a small-scale tribo-tester of pad-on-disc type. The results confirmed that in spite of spraying water to the disc, no evidence of HD water film could be observed. Hence the friction behaviour was influenced by factors other than HD film. The values of friction coefficient obtained under wet condition were in the range of dry friction, mixed and boundary lubrication friction. For instant, some values of friction coefficient for NF 1 &NF 4 were less than 0. 05 which was in the range of friction in mixed lubrication. Regardless of the type of brake pad materials, the results indicated that spraying water eliminates the establishment of the transfer layer at the friction interface and suppresses the temperature rise in the disc and so the formation of the char or other reaction products such as oxides. Besides, wear rate of all FBP materials behaved linearly with contact pressure. Qualitative assessment of the SEM morphologies of brake pad surfaces confirmed that tribofilms were hardly formed in <b>wet</b> <b>braking.</b> in addition, all brake pad surfaces showed formation of contact plateaus "patches" and disintegrations of various sizes and locations depending on the braking condition. Furthermore, the removal of material was associated with either mechanical crushing action performed by entrapped wear debris or due to disintegration of plateaus which were accelerated by spraying the water.

30|$|For the WC 55 Y shield hauler, {{a moving}} speed brake was developed, which {{integrates}} a planetary speed retarder {{and a large}} torque <b>wetted</b> multi-disc safe <b>brake.</b> Traditional brake concentrates on the high-speed end of wheel-side retarder, and is small in dimension. However, under a larger braking torque and repeated braking, the system generates large amount of heat and consistently fails. The working condition of the shield hauler is harsh. In the aspect of driveless axle hydraulic-driven design, {{there have been no}} successful braking studies anywhere in the world. Fully enclosed, high torque and large brake power, small in size, and high efficiency heat dissipation are the difficulties in the study. Meanwhile, the road underground is potholed, thus during the movement of heavy-loaded vehicles, the wheel-side retarder will withstand a greater shock load, and therefore must have enough strength. Otherwise, it will cause failures in the retarder’s bearing, such as broken parts. In response to these technical bottlenecks, a “modular integrated technology” was used to design a new planetary gear of <b>wetted</b> multiple-disc <b>brake.</b> Also, an integrated motor-cartridge wheel drive and brake retarder was invented. It is a wheel-side planetary retarder, and integrates all brake functions. The brake was designed as a fully closed wetted-type multi-disc brake with spring braking and hydraulic release. Through the spline, friction tablets and steel tablets are coupled with fixed parts and turned parts respectively. Through the motor input, retarder part input torque, delivered via a two level planetary deceleration device, the torque will be transmitted to the wheels. The brake cavity and retarder cavity are completely insulated by a pair of high reliable floating seals to avoid the interference of two different functions. The braking torque of the integrated brake-retarder is greater than 60, 000  N m, thermal equilibrium temperature is less than 90 C° under long term braking, and the average life of the friction disc is greater than 5000  h. Furthermore, it is safe, reliable, has good pollution resistance, and increases operational safety.|$|R
