25|$|For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was {{the symbol}} of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the {{financial}} difficulties of the nation were placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal, and under the new republican ideas of {{what it meant to}} be a member of a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor. The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had done its work.|$|E

25|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{replied to}} {{the critics of}} the Cetiya {{building}} project that the building had begun before the crisis, when the economy was still booming; therefore, the timing was not wrong. The temple also raised examples of other important Thai building projects that had been realized during crises. Finally, the temple posed the question: if, despite the crisis, people were still buying alcohol and cigarettes and still going to the movies, then <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> donating for a religious building? The temple also responded to its critics about the accusations of wealth, stating that the temple's wealth {{was used for the}} laypeople and Buddhist education, not for other purposes. Building large buildings benefited Buddhism as a whole, not just the temple, because it helped strengthen the religion. Apart from donating to hospitals or schools, financially supporting Buddhism should also be done, because it would help foster ethics in society.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
25|$|Jarrett was sidelined for a {{month before}} making his return at Slammiversary VIII, where he cost Sting his TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Rob Van Dam. On the June 24 episode of Impact!, Sting {{assaulted}} Jarrett {{to the point that}} TNA president Dixie Carter suspended him for 30 days without pay the following week. During Sting's suspension, Jarrett found a new enemy in Kevin Nash, who claimed that Jarrett himself, and not Sting, was <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> TNA. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 episode of Impact!, wearing a new red face paint, and, together with Nash, beat down Jarrett, Bischoff and Hogan. On the August 26 episode of Impact!, Jarrett attempted to recruit Samoa Joe to help him against Nash and Sting, but was turned down. Thus Jarrett was left alone for a match, where he was defeated by Nash, after an interference from Sting. The following week, Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Kevin Nash. After the match, Samoa Joe joined Jarrett and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender, Jarrett and Joe defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert gave the film a [...] "Thumbs down" [...] rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review, which he began with the following: [...] "Ridley Scott's Hannibal is a carnival geek show. We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity; if it proves nothing else, it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn't get the NC-17 rating for violence, nothing ever will." [...] Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39%, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10 from 163 reviews.|$|E
500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, wringing her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E

This meant that Herbert did not set {{a time in the}} session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head {{did a good job of}} protecting me. For sure I am not very happy about this, but I believe that the team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem." [...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E

500|$|Previously Mitch Albom had {{chronicled the}} Fab Five {{in a book}} {{entitled}} Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream, and Fox Sports had attempted to review the group. The press regarded this as the first complete recounting of the fabled group. Rose describes this film as [...] "almost like the Bible of the Fab Five Story". An ESPN commentator describes the five players as the greatest incoming college basketball recruiting class ever. He notes that they were presented {{to the world as}} the embodiment of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> college sports because they wore revolutionary baggy shorts and black socks and blasted hip-hop music while talking a lot of trash. The film documents the [...] "formation, rise, scandal and epilogue of the team". It documents the 1991–92 and 1992–93 teams, the University of Michigan basketball scandal, and related off the court issues such as hate mail. Forbes notes that the legacy of the quintet, which includes successive appearances in the championship game of the NCAA Men's DivisionI Basketball Championship, was overshadowed by the scandal, which necessitated the removal of Final Four banners and vacating of games. The film is noted for presenting the inside story a group of players who the contemporary media derided as thugs and villains, while enterprise rode them as a multimillion-dollar merchandising juggernaut.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come to understand <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|In game seven at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 5–2 {{lead through}} seven innings {{due to an}} {{ineffective}} start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martínez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martínez to complete the inning. Martínez then gave up a ground-rule double to Hideki Matsui, and Yankees catcher Jorge Posada blooped a double into center field that drove in two runners and tied the game. The game went into extra innings and {{in the bottom of}} the eleventh inning, leadoff hitter Aaron Boone, grandson of Ray Boone, a (retired) longtime scout with the Red Sox, hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield to left field, ending the game and the series, giving the Yankees their 39th American League pennant. The Long Island, New York, newspaper Newsday went to the press before the game was over, and thinking Boston would win the game, editorialized as to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the Yankees, and why they had lost the ALCS to the Red Sox. In a postgame interview, Red Sox firstbaseman Kevin Millar described the emotions in the Red Sox locker room: [...] "It was like we were all back in high school, like we'd all just gotten beat in the state playoffs, and everyone was going to graduate....
