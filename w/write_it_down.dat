5|$|Immediately after Randolph {{finished}} {{laying out}} the Virginia Plan, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina presented his own plan to the Convention. As Pinckney did not <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> the only evidence of the plan are Madison's notes, so the details are somewhat vague. It was a confederation, or treaty, among the thirteen states. There {{was to be a}} bicameral legislature made up of a Senate and a House of Delegates. The House would have one member for every one thousand inhabitants. The House would elect Senators who would serve by rotation for four years and represent one of four regions. Congress would meet in a joint session to elect a President, and would also appoint members of the cabinet. Congress, in joint session, would serve as the court of appeal of last resort in disputes between states. Pinckney did also provide for a supreme Federal Judicial Court. The Pinckney plan was not debated, but it may have been referred to by the Committee of Detail.|$|E

25|$|A common {{aspect of}} the {{initiation}} was a trick played on the postulant; after they {{had been made to}} swear that they would never reveal the hidden word that was the alleged source of the group's power, they would later be commanded to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> If he tried to do so, thereby breaking his oath, he would be flogged across his back or knuckles.|$|E

25|$|The Turner-Ownbey long {{distance}} telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned {{herself in the}} Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records {{were supposed to be}} sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.|$|E
25|$|The journey {{began at}} Folly Bridge in Oxford and ended 3 miles (5km) north-west {{in the village}} of Godstow. During the trip, Dodgson told the girls a story that {{featured}} a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for her. He began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version no longer exists. The girls and Dodgson took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of Alice, and in November he began working on the manuscript in earnest.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the hundreds-column will contain three digits: the hundreds-digit of the ones-row, the tens-digit of the tens-row, and the ones-digit of the hundreds-row. Find the sum of these three digits, then if there is a carry-digit from the tens-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the hundreds-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> under the second line in the hundreds-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the hundreds-column, and carry the first digit over to the thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten thousands-digit under the line.|$|E

25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), and if there is a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E
25|$|On Friday episodes {{which ran}} short, {{during the first}} season, a game was played with {{audience}} members for a small cash prize, usually $50. The game was played with regular panelist Brett Somers first. A word or phrase with a blank would be asked of Somers, and she would <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> on her card. Rayburn would then circulate amongst audience members who raised their hands to play, and if the audience member matched the answer Somers had written down, then they would win $50. Rayburn would continue picking on audience members until someone matched the answer. If there was more time left, the same game would be played with Charles Nelson Reilly responding to and writing down an answer for another audience member to guess. Rayburn sometimes seemed frustrated by {{this part of the}} show and with the answers given by some of the audience members; {{at the end of one}} episode, he was shown collapsed in one of the audience seats, seemingly exhausted.|$|E

500|$|From Mahler's later {{comments}} on the symphony's gestation, {{it is evident that}} the four-movement plan was relatively short-lived. He soon replaced the last three movements with a single section, essentially a dramatic cantata, based on the closing scenes of Goethe's Faust, the depiction of an ideal of redemption through eternal womanhood (das Ewige-Weibliche). Mahler had long nurtured an ambition to set the end of the Faust epic to music, [...] "and to set it quite differently from other composers who have made it saccharine and feeble." [...] In comments recorded by his biographer Richard Specht, Mahler makes no mention of the original four-movement plans. He told Specht that having chanced on the Veni creator hymn, he had a sudden vision of the complete work: [...] "I saw the whole piece immediately before my eyes, and only needed to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> as though it were being dictated to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch is it for me to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b> Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E
500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

50|$|With a {{first person}} {{narrative}} {{it is important}} to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> telling <b>it</b> out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are <b>writing</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> is <b>it</b> something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.|$|R

500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to <b>write</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
