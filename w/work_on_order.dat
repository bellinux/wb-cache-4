40|$|Recent <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>order</b> domains and {{linearization}} in HPSG, {{and also}} conceptually related work in categorial grammar, is argued to mirror the key ideas that motivated {{the separation between}} c-structure and f-structure in the earliest work in LFG (Bresnan 1982). This paper argues that: (i) to be descriptively adequate, all constraint-based frameworks do indeed need a dissociation between functor-argument structure and surface phrase structure, (ii) while linearization HPSG can technically {{be regarded as a}} one-level/one-stratum architecture, the complex attribute-value matrix representations proposed are better thought of as encoding multiple `virtual levels', and (iii) once this is noted, there is a general equivalence between the analyses that can be proposed in linearization HPSG and LFG, although certain differences are noted.

40|$|In {{computer}} science, {{there are}} many sorting algorithms. But all the computer algorithms are done through a certain steps of operations. What these algorithms are really done is not so clear, so it usually is {{difficult for people to}} figure out the thought of the algorithm and further improve it. Set theory and binary relations have order relations which have a close relationship with sorting in computer science. But traditional research mainly focuses on the pure mathematics operations on set theory. Pansystems strengthen the research work in set theory by combining mathematics with its philosophy background. In this paper, using pansystems PMT-combination [1] method, we re-inspect the reflexive relation and equivalence relation in set theory and find out the common characteristic of them. Then using pansystems body-expansion, we expand the traditional partial order to a new kind of order-relation. Furthermore, we point out the relationship between pansystems body-shadow relation, partial order, extended partial order and semi-partial order.

40|$|Small-scale weaving {{businesses}} that make production {{in a highly}} competitive environment in textile industry need to properly calculate the unit cost of the products, which they produce or trade, {{in order to survive}} under the market conditions. But as most of the small enterprises in the industry have a workshop-type manufacturing structure on order basis, the cost calculation processes are usually carried out based on professional experiences without a specific method. The main factors that affect the unit cost of fabrics which are woven in enterprises that <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>order</b> basis are weaving preparation, raw material, labour, energy and amortization costs. Besides these main cost elements, the incalculable hidden cost factors and the cost factors of yarn waste, product waste and shrinkage ratio must be included in the unit cost calculation. The calculations involving all these elements do not seem possible to be made by the business owners in a continuous, correct and rapid way based on the professional experiences. In this study, software to calculate the unit cost of the products that are manufactured by small weaving enterprises was created and run in a sample application. The interface of this calculation software was created in ASP. NET programming language by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 application development software.

40|$|Empirical <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>order</b> {{fulfillment}} strategies {{suggests that}} building products to customer order {{is an important}} driver of organizational value. Similarly, the experimental literature indicates that customers derive value from customization. The modeling literature provides a more equivocal perspective, suggesting {{that a combination of}} build-to-forecast (BTF) and build-to-order (BTO) fulfillment modalities may lead to the best system-wide outcomes. Using an industry studies approach, we build on these theoretical perspectives to examine order fulfillment at a global automotive producer. Interviews with key decision makers and a statistical analysis of 48, 534 individual vehicle sales enable the development of four propositions on the organizational and profitability implications of the firm’s evolution in order fulfillment strategy. Our analyses indicate that building products to customer order is a source of higher unit profit margin. The build-to-order process also exposes fault lines and generates opportunities for operational improvement, both in the order-to-delivery system and in the broader organization. Build-to-order evolves to provide the firm with insight on customers’ willingness to trade delivery lead times against their product attribute preferences. This information allows build-to-order to incorporate a demand management role, for example, by shifting custom orders to later time periods to accommodate excess demand. These changes lay the groundwork for a multi-modal order fulfillment strategy that no longer distinguishes between the order source or production modality. This strategy enhances customer responsiveness, while addressing manufacturing capacity management imperatives. Our findings open new avenues for theory building, as well as experimental, empirical and modeling research in order fulfillment...|$|E

40|$|The {{statistics}} {{literature has}} mostly {{focused on the}} case when the data available {{is in the form}} of a random sample. In many cases, the observations are not identically distributed. Such samples are called heterogeneous samples. The study of heterogeneous samples is of great interest in many areas, such as statistics, econometrics, reliability engineering, operation research and risk analysis. Stochastic orders between probability distributions is a widely studied concept. There are several kinds of stochastic orders that are used to compare different aspects of probability distributions like location, variability, skewness, dependence, etc. In this dissertation, most of the work is devoted to investigating the properties of statistics based on heterogeneous samples with the aid of stochastic orders. We will see the effect of the change in the stochastic properties of various functions of observations as their parameters change. The theory of majorization will be used for this purpose. First, order statistics from heterogeneous samples will be investigated. Order statistics appear everywhere in statistics and related areas. The k-out-of-n systems are building blocks of a coherent system. The lifetime of such a system is the same as that of the (n-k+ 1) th order statistic in a sample size of n. Stochastic comparisons between order statistics have been studied extensively in the literature in case the parent observations are independent and identically distributed. However, in practice this assumption is often violated as different components in a system may not have the same distribution. Comparatively less work has been done in the case of heterogeneous random variables, mainly because of the reason that their distribution theory is very complicated. Some open problems in the literature have been solved in the dissertation. Some new problems associated with order statistics have been investigated in the thesis. Next, stochastic properties of spacings based on heterogeneous observations are studied. Spacings are of great interest in many areas of statistics, in particular, in the characterizations of distributions, goodness-of-fit tests, life testing and reliability models. In particular, the stochastic properties of the sample range are investigated in detail. Applications in reliability theory are highlighted. The relative dependence between extreme order statistics will be investigated in Chapter 4. In particular, the open problem discussed in Dolati, et al. (2008) is solved in this Chapter. In the last Chapter, convolutions of random variables from heterogeneous samples will be investigated. Convolutions have been widely used in many areas to model many practical situations. For example, in reliability theory, it arises as the lifetime of a redundant standby system; in queuing theory, it is used to model the total service time by an agent in a system; in insurance, it is used to model total claims on a number of policies in the individual risk model. I will compare the dispersion and skewness properties of convolutions of different heterogeneous samples. The tail behavior of convolutions are investigated as well. The work in this dissertation has significant applications in many diverse areas of applied probability and statistics. For example, statistics based on order statistics and spacings from heterogeneous samples arise in studying the robust properties of statistical procedures; the <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>order</b> statistics will also provide a better estimation of lifetime of a coherent system in reliability engineering; convolution results will be of great interest in insurance and actuarial science for evaluating risks...|$|E
