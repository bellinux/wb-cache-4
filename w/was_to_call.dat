5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at Sines, Portugal, {{to lighten}} the load of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1950, Clements {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees. Wetherby's popularity soared {{as a result of this}} session, and he seriously considered running for the Senate seat vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no {{evidence}} of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|When the new Parliament {{opened in}} 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{suggested}} that tariff reform {{was the best}} way to solve Britain's economic difficulties. Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised that there would be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a new general election. In the ensuing election Baldwin's Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party. Hastings himself was re-elected without difficulty, increasing his majority.|$|E
5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{a special session}} of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E

25|$|Finding it {{increasingly}} impossible to govern, Attlee's only chance <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a snap election in October 1951, {{in the hope}} of achieving a more workable majority and to regain authority.

Attlee tendered his resignation as Prime Minister the following day, after six years and three months in office.|$|E

25|$|Ghiberti won the competition. His {{first set}} of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was {{commissioned}} to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground {{for many of the}} artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. They were a unifying factor, a source of pride and camaraderie for both the city and its artists. Michelangelo <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> them the Gates of Paradise.|$|E

Shortly before he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the 1990 men's Division I college basketball championship game on April 2, 1990, Musburger was fired by CBS management. Cross, meanwhile, was made a color analyst alongside Tim Ryan for two seasons before he left after the 1991 season. In addition, both Butkus and McDonough left the network after this game; McDonough moved to NBC's pregame team while Butkus {{decided to return to}} acting and philanthropic work. CBS elected to go with a two-man team for the next year, pulling Bradshaw and Greg Gumbel off of their respective broadcast teams and naming them the new hosts for The NFL Today.|$|E

Singing at the 20 Grand, Reeves was spotted by Motown A director Mickey Stevenson, who recognized her talent, gave her his business card and invited her to audition.

Stevenson asked her to answer phones while he took care of other business. Using the skills she had learned in commercial courses in high school, Reeves answered phones, took notes, administrated payroll for Motown's famed Funk Brothers, and made herself invaluable.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2009 Turner {{was freed}} on $500,000 bond, and was ordered {{not to use}} a {{computer}} or any device that can access the Internet. His trial started on November 30, 2009 and ended on December 4, 2009, with the defense opting not to call any witnesses. After two hours of deliberation, the jury announced it was deadlocked. Three days later the judge declared a mistrial, and a retrial was set for March 1, 2010. This second trial, overseen by Western District of Louisiana judge Donald Walter, was moved from the Northern District of Illinois to the Eastern District of New York: since the prosecution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the three judges to the stand, the defense felt that Turner would not get a fair hearing if the trial was conducted {{in the same city}} where the judges worked.

But this change in the commandment of the imperial forces, had not brought lucidity and organization in the imperial commandment, because the first thing that Jelačić gave after the commencement of his interim High Commandment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off Windisch-Grätz's plan of establishing the gathering point of the imperial armies around Esztergom, and with this to give a chance to this not bad plan.|$|E
