25|$|The {{traditional}} {{religion of}} the island is ancestor worship. In one oral tradition, the earliest residents knew {{the name of the}} creator, but thought his name was so holy that they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their children. Instead, they instructed their children to address their requests to their ancestors, who would be their mediators. In some parts of Malaita the high god responsible for creation, who has now retired from active work, is known as Agalimae ("the god of the universe"). Congregations of local descent groups propitiate their ancestors at shrines, led by ritual officiants (fataabu in northern Malaita). On Malaita, many shrines have been preserved, not only for their sanctity but also because they serve as territorial markers that can resolve land disputes.|$|E
25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

The season {{begins with the}} aftermath of Dell's death, including his funeral {{and what happens to}} his daughter Betsey. Violet and Pete get married in the season premiere and finally begin a new life with their son Lucas. Addison and Sam reveal their romance to the staff of Oceanside Wellness, which causes Naomi to leave town to learn to accept their new relationship. Cooper and Charlotte's relationship continues to get stronger as they get engaged. Charlotte is raped and badly beaten by one of the patients at her hospital and decides to only tell Addison and make her keep it a secret. Charlotte later decides she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> anyone she was raped, not even Cooper. Later everyone finds out but Charlotte won't identify Lee McHenry, her rapist. Later we find out Violet was raped while she was in college. Charlotte finally decides to identify Lee because Sheldon tells her to do so. She goes to the police station, but since she did not accuse him and because of the long history of Charlotte not telling, the lawyer does not accept to charge Lee, who is later stabbed by his girl friend in self-defense. She tells the authorities about almost getting killed, which finally leads to Lee's arrest, but before this, he is saved at the surgeon's slab with Charlotte granting the procedure in spite of her being victimized by him. In the season finale it was decided that they will close down Oceanside Wellness and open another practice; and Naomi decides {{it would be best to}} move to New York to be with Gabriel.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] {{had been}} the least {{well-known}} of Harrison's three tracks on Revolver, it gained greater renown after he began performing it live in the early 1990s. A live version from his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton opens Harrison's Live In Japan album, released in 1992. Harrison said that, even before rehearsals, he had chosen [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] as the opening song for the tour, which marked his first series of concerts since 1974, and {{his first visit to}} Japan since the Beatles had played there during their 1966 world tour. On this live version, he and Clapton extend the song by each playing a guitar solo. [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] was also Harrison's opener at the Natural Law Party Concert, held at London's Royal Albert Hall in April 1992, which was his only full-length concert as a solo artist in Britain. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Jeff Lynne performed [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] at the Concert for George tribute, where it served as the first song of the main, Western-music portion of the event. Lynne was backed by a large band, including Clapton and other musicians who had supported Harrison on the 1991 tour and at the Natural Law Party Concert.|$|E
500|$|Ted Nugent covered [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] on his 1979 album State of Shock, {{a version}} that Billboards {{reviewer}} said was [...] "probably enough {{to sell the}} album". Nugent's recording was also released as a single that year, and later appeared on his 1998 compilation Super Hits. The Lambrettas and Mike Melvoin are among the other artists who have recorded the song. The Grateful Dead included [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] in their live performances in 1994, before which Jerry Garcia had occasionally performed it live with his long-running solo project, the Jerry Garcia Band.|$|E
500|$|In his {{overview}} of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You", Alan Pollack highlights Harrison's descending guitar riff as [...] "one of those all-time great ostinato patterns {{that sets the}} tone of the whole song right from the start". Producer and musician Chip Douglas has stated that he based the guitar riff for the Monkees' 1967 hit [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] on that of the Beatles' song. Neil Innes of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band (and later the Rutles) recalls being at Abbey Road Studios while the Beatles were recording [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] and his band were working on a 1920s vaudeville song titled [...] "My Brother Makes the Noises for the Talkies". Innes said he heard the Beatles playing back [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] at full volume and appreciated then, in the words of music journalist Robert Fontenot, [...] "just how far out of their league he was, creatively". Innes has since included his recollection of this episode in his stage show.|$|E

500|$|According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Harrison's Revolver {{compositions}} – [...] "Taxman", {{which opened}} the album, the Indian music-styled [...] "Love You To", and [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] – established {{him as a}} songwriter within the band. Recalling the release in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that Revolver displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from the Beatles' [...] "prettiest music" [...] to [...] "their scariest", among which [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] represented the band at [...] "their friendliest". Commenting on the unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a Beatles album, Harrison told Melody Maker in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator, as Lennon and McCartney were to one another. He added: [...] "when you're competing against John and Paul, {{you have to be}} very good to even get in the same league." ...|$|E
500|$|In America, {{due to the}} {{controversy}} there surrounding Lennon's remark that the Beatles had become more popular than Christianity, the initial reviews of Revolver were relatively lukewarm. While commenting on this phenomenon in September 1966, KRLA Beats reviewer described [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] as [...] "unusual, newly-melodic, and interesting" [...] and lamented that, as with songs such as [...] "She Said She Said" [...] and [...] "Yellow Submarine", it was being denied the recognition it deserved.|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock group}} the Beatles from their 1966 album Revolver.

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] address {{problems}} in communication and {{the inadequacy of}} words in conveying genuine emotion. Writing in 1969, author Dave Laing identified [...] "serene desperation" [...] in the song's [...] "attempt at real total contact in any interpersonal context". Author Ian Inglis notes that lines such as [...] "My head is filled with things to say" [...] and [...] "The games begin to drag me down" [...] present in modern-day terms the same concepts regarding interpersonal barriers with which philosophers have struggled since the pre-Socratic period.|$|E
500|$|Is it {{reasonable}} for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while {{the producer of}} poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic.

One thing is for sure: Current prices [...] do not support all producers.|$|E
500|$|When writing [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You", Harrison drew {{inspiration}} from his experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The lyrics address what he later termed [...] "the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties of achieving meaningful communication. The recording {{marked the first time}} that McCartney played his bass guitar part after the band had completed the rhythm track for a song, a technique that became common on the Beatles' subsequent recordings.|$|E

500|$|EMI's Parlophone label {{released}} Revolver on 5 August 1966, {{one week}} before the Beatles began their final North American tour. [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] was sequenced between Lennon's song about a New York doctor who administered amphetamine doses to his wealthy patients, [...] "Doctor Robert", and [...] "Got to Get You into My Life", which McCartney said he wrote as [...] "an ode to pot". For the North American version of Revolver, however, Capitol Records omitted [...] "Doctor Robert", together with two other Lennon-written tracks; as a result, the eleven-song US release reinforced the level of contribution from McCartney and from Harrison.|$|E
500|$|According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone, [...] "Harrison's {{openness}} to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his {{rock and roll}} compositions. His use of dissonance on... 'Taxman' and 'I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky..." [...] In 1997, Gerry Farrell commented: [...] "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement... that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples {{of this type of}} fusion." ...|$|E
500|$|Among music {{critics and}} Beatles biographers, many writers have admired the group's {{performance}} on the track, particularly McCartney's use of Indian-style vocal melisma. Harrison performed [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] as the opening song throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton. A version recorded during that tour appears on his Live in Japan album. At the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, the song was used to open the Western portion of the event, when it was performed by Jeff Lynne. Ted Nugent, the Smithereens, Thea Gilmore and the Melvins are among the other artists who have covered the track.|$|E

500|$|... "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] {{is in the}} key of A {{major and}} in a {{standard}} time signature of 4/4. It contains a low-register, descending guitar riff that music journalist Richie Unterberger describes as [...] "circular, full" [...] and [...] "typical of 1966 British mod rock". The riff opens and closes the song and recurs between the verses. Particularly over the introduction, the rests between the riff's syncopated notes create a stammering effect. The metric anomalies suggested by this effect are borne out further in the uneven, eleven-bar length of the verse. The main portion of the song consists of two verses, a bridge (or middle eight), followed by a verse, a second bridge and the final verse.|$|E
500|$|In 1971 {{the song}} was issued as the title track of an EP release in Mexico. Part {{of a series of}} Beatles {{releases}} sequenced by Lennon, the EP also included the Harrison-written tracks [...] "Love You To", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] and [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You". In 1978 [...] "Within You Without You" [...] appeared as the B-side to the [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"/"With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] medley, on singles released in West Germany and some other European countries. An instrumental version of the track, at the original speed and in the key of C, appeared on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 2.|$|E
500|$|In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Schaffner wrote that, {{next to the}} {{dominant}} Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership, Harrison's three compositions on Revolver – [...] "Love You To", [...] "Taxman" [...] and [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> You" [...] – [...] "offered ample indication that there were now three prolific songwriting Beatles". Schaffner also commented that, through his championing of the sitar and Shankar's music, Harrison {{came to be seen}} as [...] "the maharaja of raga-rock", as other Western musicians began adopting Indian musical stylings. In the Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine, a brief portion of the song is used to introduce Harrison's character, as a guru-like figure, standing on a hill.|$|E
