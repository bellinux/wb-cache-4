DWRs incorporating side-chain fluorinated polymers based on long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are being phased out due to the recognition of the hazard they pose to humans and the environment. In this thesis the first steps towards a holistic environmental assessment of alternative DWRs are presented. A hazard assessment focussing on diffusively released substances showed that the available alternatives have better hazard profiles compared to the DWRs based on long-chain PFAS. Hydrocarbon based DWRs were assessed as most benign while properties of concern were identified for both side-chain-fluorinated polymers based on short-chain PFASs and silicones. To fully assess the human health and environmental toxicity impacts of the alternatives, including the possible trade-offs creating other types of negative impacts, risk assessment and life cycle assessment (LCA) are recommended methods and will be used to establish a substitution scheme. In addition to risks to {{human health and the environment}} due to chemical releases, a sound substitution scheme must also consider risks connected to DWR failure, and strive towards minimal release of hazardous substances.

50|$|The high {{surface tension}} of water causes {{droplets}} {{to assume a}} nearly spherical shape, since a sphere has minimal surface area, and this shape therefore demands least solid-liquid surface energy. On contact with a surface, adhesion forces result in wetting of the surface. Either complete or incomplete wetting may occur depending {{on the structure of}} the surface and the fluid tension of the droplet.The cause of self-cleaning properties is the hydrophobic water-repellent double structure of the surface. This enables the contact area and the adhesion force between surface and droplet to be significantly reduced resulting in a self-cleaning process.This hierarchical double structure is formed out of a characteristic epidermis (its outermost layer called the cuticle) and the covering waxes. The epidermis of the lotus plant possesses papillae with 10 µm to 20 µm in height and 10 µm to 15 µm in width on which the so-called epicuticular waxes are imposed. These superimposed waxes are hydrophobic and form the second layer of the double structure. This system regenerates.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{progress}} in relating {{the incidence of}} <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> to other soil attributes, relating the severity of <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> to different soil management and landuses and determining the value of soil survey in predicting the risk of <b>water</b> <b>repellency.</b> Data sets of soils from south-western Australia are used for this analysis. The relationship between <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> and other soil attributes such as clay and organic matter contents {{has been found to}} be multivariate in nature, with a general form: <b>Water</b> <b>repellency</b> ≃ a Organic Matterb/Clay(c) where a, b and c are constants. Multiple regressions, which use a variety of attributes related to soil organic matter and soil surface area (e. g. clay, silt, amorphous iron contents), can explain up to 63 % of the variation in <b>water</b> <b>repellency.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>repellency</b> increases in severity with increasing organic carbon content or decreasing soil surface area and vice versa. This relationship explains the poor or non-existent bivariate relationships between various soil attributes and <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> reported in several studies and allows the re-interpretation of studies into the effects of liming, zero-till and different rotation lengths on <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> as each affect soil organic carbon (OC) content. It is also consistent with observations that <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> is more prevalent on sandy soils and reported reductions in <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> following applications of clay and fine inorganic materials. It similarly explains the occurrence of <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> on soils with > 5 % clay; accumulation of sufficient amounts of OC can induce <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> in any soil. Soil management and landuse affect <b>water</b> <b>repellency.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>repellency</b> is less severe in soils under crops compared to pastures and this has been considered as being caused by differences in organic matter composition. This is re-interpreted as being due to differences in organic matter amount as cultivation mineralises and dilutes soil organic matter in the topsoil. <b>Water</b> <b>repellency</b> is also a feature of soils under natural vegetation (Eucalyptus, Banksia spp.) and may be more severe than that for agricultural soils. Increments of organic matter from natural vegetation can induce <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> to a greater extent than equivalent amounts of organic matter from agricultural species. Thus, <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> can be considered as a natural feature of soils, rather than a form of land degradation due to farming. Comparisons between the <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> associated with different soil management or landuses are problematic due to differences in not only OC content and composition but also other soil properties such as surface area, due to the spatial separation of the areas compared. Given the underlying relationship between clay content and <b>water</b> <b>repellency,</b> field texture data from soil surveys can be used to predict the risk of <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> developing, this providing a basis for optimum management practice. The degree to which this <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> develops will be dependent on management practices and their effects on soil organic matter content. Quite costly, but profitable, ameliorative management (e. g. clay application) can thus be applied to sites where required, rather than to large areas on a non-specific basis...|$|E

Soil <b>water</b> <b>repellency</b> appeared to be the rule rather than the exception, both before and after fire, and was strongly related to soil moisture and organic matter content.

Synergistic superhydrophilic-underwater superoleophobic surfaces were fabricated by spray deposition of nanostructured TiO[subscript 2] on {{stainless steel mesh}} substrates. The coated meshes were then used to study gravity driven oil–water separation, where only {{the water from the}} oil–water mixture is allowed to permeate through the mesh. Oil–water separation efficiencies of up to 99 % could be achieved through the coated mesh of pore sizes 50 and 100 μm, compared to no separation at all, that was observed in the case of uncoated meshes of the same material and pore sizes. An adsorbed water on the TiO[subscript 2] coated surface, formation of a water-film between the wires that form the mesh and the underwater superoleophobicity of the structured surface are the key factors that contribute to the enhanced efficiency observed in oil–water separation. The nature of the oil–water separation process using this coated mesh (in which the mesh allows water to pass through the porous structure but resists wetting by the oil phase) minimizes the fouling of mesh so that the need for frequent replacement of the separating medium is reduced. The fabrication approach presented here can be applied for coating large surface areas and to develop a large-scale oil–water separation facility for oil-field applications and petroleum industries.
