She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Love.|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{point of}} this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point {{is not that it}} is impossible to define [...] "game", but that we don't have a definition, and we don't need one, because even without the definition, we use the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for [...] "game", [...] "", has a different sense than in English; the meaning of [...] "Spiele" [...] also extends to the concept of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "playing." [...] This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein's context in the remarks regarding games.|$|E

2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The hydrological cycle moves water around different reservoirs {{on the surface of the}} earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly fractionated. [...] As the primary moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. In the hydrological cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation. It should be pointed out that oxygen isotopic composition (18O/16O) of water is also an important tracer in the hydrological cycle, and cannot be separated from hydrogen isotopes <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> isotope fractionation processes associated with water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said {{it had to be done}} in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.|$|E

You have a quick mind, Miss De Ormond. Two months ago some half-dozen of us went in a motor-car for a day's run into the country. We stopped at a road-house for dinner.

Half a score of pompous old muddlers with their fat wives egging them on: sons of the fools before them; talkers who have wormed {{themselves}} into power by making frothy speeches and fine promises. My Country!" [...] he laughed again. [...] "Look at them. Can't you see their swelling paunches and their flabby faces? Half a score of ambitious politicians, gouty old financiers, bald-headed old toffs, with their waxed moustaches and false teeth. That's what we mean <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'My Country': a pack of selfish, soulless, muddle- headed old men.

6000|$|Now in the {{constitution}} of a modern state, because of the conflict and confusion of ideas, {{all or most of}} these five sub-classes may usually be found intertwined. The British constitution, for instance, is a complicated tangle of arrangements, due to a struggle between the ideas of Class I.(2), Class II.(3), tending to become Class II.(1) and Class II.(2) in both its aristocratic and monarchist forms. The American constitution is largely dominated by Class I.(2), from which it breaks away {{in the case of the}} President to a short-term monarchist aspect of Class II.(1). I will not elaborate this classification further. I have made it here in order to render clear first, that what we moderns mean by democracy is not what the Greeks meant at all, that is to say, direct government by the assembly of all the citizens, and secondly and more important, that the word [...] "democracy" [...] is being used very largely in current discussion, so that it is impossible to say in any particular case whether the intention is Class I.(2) or Class II.(1), and that we have to make up our minds whether we mean, if I may coin two phrases, [...] "delegate democracy" [...] or [...] "selective democracy," [...] or some definite combination of these two, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "democracy," [...] before we can get on much beyond a generous gesture of equality and enfranchisement towards our brother man. The word is being used, in fact, confusingly for these two quite widely different things.|$|E
6000|$|But of {{one thing}} I must warn you, that you must not {{confound}} Madam How and Lady Why. Many people do it, and fall into great mistakes thereby,--mistakes that even a little child, if it would think, need not commit. But really great philosophers sometimes make this mistake about Why and How; and therefore {{it is no wonder}} if other people make it too, when they write children's books about the wonders of nature, and call them [...] "Why and Because," [...] or [...] "The Reason Why." [...] The books are very good books, and you should read and study them: but they do not tell you really [...] "Why and Because," [...] but only [...] "How and So." [...] They do not tell you the [...] "Reason Why" [...] things happen, but only [...] "The Way in which they happen." [...] However, I must not blame these good folks, for I have made the same mistake myself often, and may do it again: but all the more shame to me. For see--you know perfectly the difference between How and Why, when you are talking about yourself. If I ask you, [...] "Why did we go out to-day?" [...] You would not answer, [...] "Because we opened the door." [...] That is the answer to [...] "How did we go out?" [...] The answer to Why did we go out is, [...] "Because we chose to take a walk." [...] Now <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> other things beside ourselves, we must remember this same difference between How and Why. If I ask you, [...] "Why does fire burn you?" [...] you would answer, I suppose, being a little boy, [...] "Because it is hot;" [...] which is all you know about it. But if you were a great chemist, instead of a little boy, you would be apt to answer me, I am afraid, [...] "Fire burns because the vibratory motion of the molecules of the heated substance communicates itself to the molecules of my skin, and so destroys their tissue;" [...] which is, I dare say, quite true: but it only tells us how fire burns, the way or means by which it burns; it does not tell us the reason why it burns.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am trying}} to feel {{my way through the}} most {{difficult}} problem, the most difficult situation that a responsible Government can have to face. Of course, I am dependent upon information. But as I read it, as I listen to serious Indian experts with large experience, it all sounds estrangement and alienation even though it be no worse than superficial. Now that is the problem that we have to deal with. Gentlemen, I should very badly repay your kindness in asking me to come among you to-night, if I were to attempt for a minute to analyse or to prove all the conditions that have led to this state of things. It would need hours and days. This is not, I think, the occasion, nor the moment. Our first duty--the first duty of any Government--is to keep order. But just remember this. It would be idle to deny, and I am not sure that any of you gentlemen would deny, that there is at this moment, and there has been for some little time past, and very likely there will be for some time to come, a living movement {{in the mind of the}} peoples for whom you are responsible. A living movement, and a movement for what? A movement for objects which we ourselves have all taught them to think desirable objects. And unless we somehow or other can reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideas and aspirations, gentlemen, the fault will not be theirs. It will be ours. It will mark the breakdown of what has never yet broken down in any part of the world--the breakdown of British statesmanship. That is what it will do. Now I do not believe anybody--either in this room or out of this room--believes that we can now enter upon an era of pure repression. You cannot enter at this date and with English public opinion, mind you, watching you, upon an era of pure repression, and I do not believe really that anybody desires any such thing. I do not believe so. Gentlemen, we have seen attempts, in the lifetime of some of us here to-night, attempts in Continental Europe, to govern by pure repression. Has one of them really succeeded? They have all failed. There may be now and again a spurious semblance of success, but in truth they have all failed. Whether we with our enormous power and resolution should fail, I do not know. But I do not believe anybody in this room representing so powerfully as you do dominant sentiments that are not always felt in England--that in this room there is anybody who is for an era of pure repression. Gentlemen, I would just digress for a moment if I am not tiring you. ("Go on,") About the same time as the transfer, about fifty years ago, of the Government of India from the old East India Company to the Crown, another very important step was taken, a step which I have often thought since I have been concerned with the Government of India was far more momentous, one almost deeper than the transfer to the Crown. And what do you think that was? That was the first establishment--I think I am right in my date--of Universities. We in this country are so accustomed to look upon political changes as the only important changes, that we very often forget such a change as the establishment of Universities. And if any of you are inclined to prophesy, I should like to read to you something that was written by that great and famous man, Lord Macaulay, in the year 1836, long before the Universities were thought of. What did he say? What a warning it is, gentlemen. He wrote, in the year 1836:--"At the single town of Hooghly 1,400 boys are learning English. The effect of this education on the Hindus is prodigious.... It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal thirty years hence. And this will be effected merely by the natural operation of knowledge and reflection." [...] Ah, gentlemen, the natural operation of knowledge and reflection carries men of a different structure of mind, different beliefs, different habits and customs of life--it carries them into strange and unexpected paths. I am not going to embark you to-night upon these vast controversies, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> education, are we not getting very near the root of the case? Now to-night we are not in the humour--I am sure you are not, I certainly am not--for philosophising. Somebody is glad of it. I will tell you what I think of--as I have for a good many months past--I think first of the burden of responsibility weighing on the governing men at Calcutta and Simla and the other main centres of power and of labour. We think of the anxieties of those in India, and in England as well, who have relatives in remote places and under conditions that are very familiar to you all. I have a great admiration for the self-command, for the freedom from anything like panic, which has hitherto marked the attitude of the European population of Calcutta and some other places, and I confess I have said to myself that if they had found here, in London, bombs in the railway carriages, bombs under the Prime Minister's House, and so forth, we should have had tremendous scare headlines and all the other phenomena of excitement and panic. So far as I am informed, though very serious in Calcutta--the feeling is serious, how could it be anything else?--they have exercised the great and noble virtue, in all ranks and classes, of self-command. Now the Government--if you will allow me for a very few moments to say a word on behalf of the Government, not here alone but at Simla--we and they, for after all we are one--have been assailed for a certain want of courage and what is called, often grossly miscalled, vigour.|$|E
