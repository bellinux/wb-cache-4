5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|With their closed valence shells, {{the noble}} gases {{have the highest}} first {{ionization}} potentials in each of their periods, and feeble interatomic forces of attraction, with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points. That is <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all gases under standard conditions, even those with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the plans}} for Tracy and Jenna, Jack tells Liz—the head writer for TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Liz {{recruits}} TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to help in her search, planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent. Both agree {{to try to keep}} the process secret from the cast and crew for fear that they would be angered over the idea of a new actor joining the cast. Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff. They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) who, angered by the news, quits the show.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies about <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob {{to watch what}} happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

5|$|Doggett soon attacks Mulder {{for looking}} into his son's case, but Reyes {{explains}} <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> investigating. She reveals that Bob Harvey, {{a suspect in}} Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his major}} prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which {{contained}} a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus {{was one of the}} first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> credited to him. It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used bibliomancy for this—randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.|$|E
5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion shots. Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and tracking system shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> still used to this day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E
