500|$|Nothing {{would have}} {{happened}} without the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I believe in this." [...] What they were saying was: [...] "It's a load of shite. I'm going to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I don't care what people think." [...] That {{was the key to}} it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I {{am not going to}} back down from it.

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was {{admitted}} to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired. I still feel engaged by <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I still have people who like to watch it." ...|$|E

His songs {{have appeared on}} more than 50 compilation CDs, and he has made nearly 40 guest appearances on the albums of artists including Lori McKenna, David Wilcox and Mark Erelli. When {{asked if he would}} rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, [...] "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like [...] "American Pie" [...] or something, but I'm just gonna do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> take what I can and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have. So I don't have [...] Springsteen-esque hopes. I just want to write great songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now. She continued {{to do well in}} Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.|$|E
500|$|On August 10, 2012, Beyoncé {{appeared}} at the Assembly for the rehearsals prior to the performance. Julia Stiles, The-Dream and Diane Warren were the celebrities who attended the performance. Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being". He further recalled a [...] "dark day {{in the history of}} the U.N." [...] when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Iraq on August 19, 2003 adding that the event and the World Humanitarian Day both honor those lost lives and encourage others to join the effort. He further interviewed guests whose relatives lost their lives in the accident. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also appeared encouraging everyone to log on to the website WHD-IWasHere.org by August 19 and commit to doing one good act to help someone in need further saying, [...] "I told Beyoncé: It's great that we have her, because she can reach millions of people. I could spend the rest of my life doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I wouldn't reach a 10th of that number. And she said: 'Don't sell yourself short.'.|$|E
60|$|And there I paused. The {{thought of}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the {{consequences}} must be rushed suddenly upon me. I shivered {{as a man}} shivers in awaking. I dropped on my knees before her, bowing my head and flinging wide my arms.|$|R

500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
2500|$|By this time, Rollins {{had become}} {{well known for}} taking {{relatively}} banal or unconventional songs (such as [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business" [...] on Work Time, [...] "Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye" [...] on The Sound of Sonny, and later [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] on the Grammy-winning album This Is <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do)</b> <b>and</b> using them as vehicles for improvisation.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{an instant}} success, the novel {{steadily}} increased in sales, eventually attracting a following behind its core idea of [...] "Generation X". Over his own protestations, Coupland was dubbed the spokesperson for a generation, stating in 2006 [...] "I {{was just doing}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> people sort of stuck that on to me. It's not like I spend my days thinking that way." [...] Terms popularized by Coupland in the novel, including Generation X and McJob, ultimately entered the vernacular.|$|E

"But, Your Grace," [...] cried Sir Rowland, so {{fiercely}} {{that one}} of the tything-men set a restraining hand upon his shoulder, [...] "I am ready to swear that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> my friend Mr. Westmacott did, was done in the interests of His Majesty.

2500|$|In February 2012, Adelson told Forbes {{magazine}} {{that he is}} [...] "against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections. But as long as it's doable I'm going to do it. Because I know that guys like Soros {{have been doing it}} for years, if not decades. And they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money. I have my own philosophy and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it. I don't want to go through ten different corporations to hide my name. I'm proud of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I'm not looking to escape recognition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her {{in a bit of a}} state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E
