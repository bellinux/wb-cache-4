5|$|In July 1973, {{designs for}} the {{memorial}} had been received from 38 sculptors but the top two prizes were not awarded; {{it was found that}} no entry was deemed <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> honour by the AIS panel of judges earlier. Instead, five sculptors received merit awards from AIS, together with a token S$250.|$|E
5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church {{but also because it}} has always been looked upon as an honor. It is a chance for children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position.|$|E

5|$|Following this action, Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a {{corps of}} 10,00012,000 men {{in his first}} {{independent}} command. There he participated in the Battle of Hoyerswerda with General Frederick August Finck. Prince Henry, in overall command of the army, surprised von Daun at Hoyerswerda by punching {{a hole in the}} Austrian defensive line. This success gave Frederick the first good news he had had in weeks and confirmed to Frederick that Wunsch had been <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trust placed in him.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{hero and}} heroine split {{up to find}} the Mana Sword. After the hero passes trials to prove himself <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword, which first appears as a rusty blade, the two join forces to storm the Mana Tree and defeat Julius. They do so, but the tree is killed in the process; prior to death, the tree reveals {{that she was the}} heroine's mother, and asks the heroine to replace her as the next Mana Tree. The heroine agrees, and the two protagonists part ways.|$|E

50|$|He {{was a very}} {{distinguished}} and literate person, who socialized with Alexandre Herculano, António Feliciano de Castilho {{and other}} <b>worthies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, reached a position of a certain relief in Letters {{since he was a}} student, when he published poems in the Trovador, to which group he belonged.

5|$|After Arthur's {{death in}} January 1943, Ninah Cummer began {{collecting}} art in earnest. During the fifteen years before her death, Ninah expanded her art collection to sixty pieces, {{all of which}} are still in the Museum’s collection today. In 1957, the year before her death, Ninah announced that her gifts would “make only a small beginning toward a large vision” and hoped “that others will share this vision and by their interest and contributions will help establish here a center of beauty and culture <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community.” She created the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation, named for the deceased infant daughter of the Cummers, to manage her vision after her death.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, Lutosławski {{started work}} on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez {{conducted}} the second movement, Direct, in 1966, and when the first movement, Hésitant, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony {{is very different from}} a conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the Sonning Award, Denmark's highest musical honour.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to borrowing deities from the Celestial Masters and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists {{is known as}} the Yuanshi Tianzun or the Celestial <b>Worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the Celestial Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging {{at the beginning of the}} Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the Celestial Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in the celestial hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Indonesian Film Festival Awards, the Citra Award was first given at the IFF in 1955. There were two {{recipients}} that year: A.N. Alcaff of Lewat Djam Malam and A. Hadi of Tarmina. The multiple winners, {{also found in the}} Best Film and Best Leading Actress categories, was controversial; film critics considered Lewat Djam Malam by far the better film and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik's funding of the festival had influenced Tarmina win. Succeeding festivals were held in 1960 and 1967. The IFF was held annually from 1973. Awards were presented at all IFF ceremonies except in 1980; that year, the jury decided that none of the nominated actors had put on performances <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prize. After the 1992 IFF, a sharp decline in film production led the festival to be discontinued. It was reinstated as an annual event in 2004, after receiving funds from the Indonesian government. The most recent winner of this Citra Award is Dedy Soetomo, who was recognised at the 2015 IFF for his performance in Mencari Hilal.|$|E

Although steeped in history, Scotland's burghs remained <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's system <b>of</b> local government for centuries. Burgh status conferred on its citizens the right to elect their own town councils, run their own affairs and raise their own local taxes or rates.|$|R

30|$|It is {{possible}} to notice in particular that while the G peak shape and position are unaffected by laser exposure (only {{a slight increase in}} intensity is <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> note), <b>the</b> D and 2 D peaks change significantly their structure.|$|R

25|$|Division II (Excellent). An unusual {{performance}} {{in many respects}} but not <b>worthy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest rating due to minor defects in performance or ineffective interpretation. A performance of distinctive quality.|$|E
