25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

500|$|Farrell met English {{actress and}} singer Amelia Warner at {{the premiere of}} Quills in 2000. They dated from July to November 2001. There was {{speculation}} that they married; of the experience, the actor said [...] "Too fast, too young." [...] However, in December 2011 Warner told The Sun that the marriage was never legal: [...] "We had a ceremony {{on a beach in}} Tahiti that was by no means legal and we knew it wasn't... It was just a thing we did on holiday. We went shark feeding and then <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel." [...] Farrell has a tattoo of Amelia's name around his ring finger.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for your call time. So when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high." [...] Vocalist Tom Araya said that there [...] "are two principal music writers in this band, so you're {{going to get a}} combination of speed and heaviness," [...] and later said that the [...] "writing is really aggressive and fast, while Jeff likes things to be fast, but with melodies and grooves. In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when we get together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E

500|$|All guitars on {{the album}} were tuned down a {{half-step}} in order to [...] "make the music a little lower", according to Corgan. On some songs, like [...] "Jellybelly", the first string was tuned down an additional whole step to C (referred to by Corgan as [...] "the 'grunge tuning'"). There was a greater variety {{to the number of}} guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, [...] "n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn't really the train of thought this time, although <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> too." [...] "To Forgive" [...] consists of only one live guitar take, while [...] "Thru the Eyes of Ruby" [...] contains approximately 70guitar tracks. The various sections of [...] "Porcelina of the Vast Oceans" [...] were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools. Corgan and Iha shared soloing duties; Iha estimated that the guitar solo duties were divided [...] "half and half" [...] on the record.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity... it was pop." ...|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That was the first time <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> back and forth, which he always does with me until I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|After several {{workshops}} of {{the show}} with co-star Craig Bierko, including a topless scene, Levering said: [...] "It's a very physically draining show.

On the contrary", and that [...] "We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [...] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking". He also said, [...] "Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state". In October 2014, Netanyahu said [...] "We don't just hand over territory, close our eyes and hope for the best. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> in Lebanon and we got thousands of rockets. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> in Gaza, we got Hamas and 15,000 rockets.
