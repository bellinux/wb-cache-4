25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are Unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a flatbed truck and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used {{for an extended period of}} time, they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the <b>waste</b> <b>receptacle.</b> For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cigarette}} receptacle is {{a container}} or device for extinguishing {{and disposal of}} cigarette waste. Other common names for cigarette receptacle include: ash urn, ash pan, butt receptacles, butt bins, butt holders, snuffers, smokers poles, cigarette <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles,</b> smokers <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles,</b> and ash/trash combination. Originally provided as a courtesy to smokers in public places, cigarette receptacles are now commonplace as smoking bans and designated smoking areas require proper disposal methods. A typical receptacle can hold hundreds - even thousands - of disposed cigarette butts. [...] While the United States congress has not attempted to pass a nationwide smoking ban, many states and local governments have enacted their own statutes addressing smoking in public places.|$|R

Their purpose was simply to justify the publisher's claim to a title, thereby preventing a competitor from publishing the same title or a similar one. Ashcans were also produced to demonstrate the publications to potential advertisers.|$|E
5000|$|Any chametz {{that remains}} {{following}} {{the completion of}} three meals is disposed of. If chametz is found after Passover begins, it is customary to bag it and place it outdoors until it can be disposed of in proper <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles</b> following {{the third day of}} Passover. (It is not disposed of immediately because of the restriction of working or carrying money on the first and last two days of Passover, similar to the restrictions on laborious activities on Shabbat.)

50|$|It is {{advised that}} each {{community}} assess the overlooked chametz, and, if the amount is substantial, donate double in fresh chametz (bread and bread products) directly {{to those in}} need, through organizations that feed those in need, immediately following {{the second day of}} the Passover. The actual extra chametz would likely become too stale for human consumption by the time it could reach those in need, so it is considered a mitzvah (good deed) to leave this extra chametz in public areas as food for birds and squirrels. Some national laws do not allow this because it may attract dangerous or unwanted wildlife, so instead the extra chametz should simply be thrown out in outdoor <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles.</b> This practice is decided by the rabbis in each community. Individuals generally consult with a local rabbi in the event of finding any substantial chametz during Passover.|$|R

50|$|In {{parts of}} India, Sri Lanka and {{southern}} China, areca nuts {{are not only}} chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used {{in the preparation of}} Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines. Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some dentifrices. Other traditional uses include the removal of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a decoction, or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids. According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against bad breath. Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with Uncaria gambir during his visit to China in the 1830s. After chewing a betelnut, the red residue, buai pekpek, is generally spat out and is considered an eyesore. This has led many places to ban chewing buai as many people spit the pekpek on the ground rather than in a spit cup or <b>waste</b> <b>receptacle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Judging by {{observation}} and past watershed projects, our group saw that recycling at Edgewood was not effective. We also {{noticed that the}} hallway <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles</b> on campus were more effective than classroom receptacles. Since recycling has so many benefits, we thought that making the classroom receptacles more similar to the hallway receptacles might improve the recycling on campus. Our group constructed tops for the classroom receptacles that reassembled the hallway receptacles and labeled the tops more clearly and obviously. We found that the “new/improved ” tops were effective in improving recycling on campus. We suggest some minor improvements with our experiment for further research, such as more communication with custodial staff and more extensive labeling. Recycling has both environmental benefits as well as financial benefits. Some of these environmental benefits include the conservation of energy, the reduction of pollution, decreases {{in the amount of}} global climate change, and limits the disruption to biodiversity.

40|$|Many waste {{collection}} operations {{run on the}} traditional fixed round - fixed time service, where commercial and domestic customers have their bins serviced at agreed intervals. With remote sensing technology now coming onto the market that allows <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles</b> to report their fill levels at regular intervals (e. g. daily), there is the opportunity for dynamic optimisation of collection schedules to better meet their true servicing needs. This paper investigates this possibility using a case study involving collections of donated goods (e. g. clothing, books) from Oxfam charity banks and shops. Oxfam operates a network of around 1300 donation banks across the UK, currently serviced on a fixed schedule basis, and there is considerable interest in the transport cost reductions that could be realised through optimising collections using real-time feedback on donation rates (a dynamic and heterogeneous variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with time windows, working time restrictions and customer selection). The case study is based on one of Oxfam’s 33 defined operating areas in the UK comprising collections from 37 bank sites and 50 shops...|$|R
40|$|Quantities {{and types}} of solid wastes {{generated}} at Ogbomosho leprosarium (Oyo State, Nigeria) have been investigated. Data collection, through waste sampling and analysis, interviews, questionnaire surveys and field observations, was conducted between August and November 2006. Results indicate a notably low mean waste generation rate of 241. 5 g/h/d, which included bandages, paper, food waste, animal waste, wood ash, yard trimmings, amongst others. There is no national policy on waste handling. Domestic waste is mixed with biomedical waste without sorting. Moreover, waste-handlers deal with waste materials by hand and without protective clothing or gloves, which needlessly exposes them to greater health risks. Similarly, primitive hygiene facilities (e. g. pit latrines, plus inadequate and intermittent water supplies) constitute a health risk to patients, staff and visitors. Recommendations include i) provision of separate <b>waste</b> <b>receptacles</b> at generation points to facilitate proper sorting and segregation; ii) adequate training and protective clothing for waste handlers; and iii) national and international action for leprosy patients housed in these ‘out of sight, out of mind’ communes...|$|R
5000|$|Reese recalls Odessa as a “growing city” {{requiring}} street pavement, {{the extension}} of sewer lines, and plans for managed growth. When sanitation workers went on strike, Reese went to their workplace and told them, “If you’ll go back to work, we’ll figure out something” to relieve their back-breaking work and low wages. As a result, Odessa began the use of dumpsters placed in an alley or along the streets with mechanically-embellished trucks lifting the plastic <b>waste</b> <b>receptacle</b> with a forklift and depositing the garbage and trash into the truck bed, usually equipped with a compactor. This technology was first advanced in the 1950s in Knoxville, Tennessee, by brothers with the unlikely name of Dempster. Two large metal arms grab the standardized container, lift it over the cab, and tip the garbage into the hopper. [...] That system is now universal in most cities, as workers ride {{in the comfort of}} air-conditioned cabs and rarely leave the truck while on their errands. Technology hence relieved the workers of past drudgery. Reese recalls that Odessa was the first city in his region to utilize the new technology.|$|E
40|$|One serious {{consequence}} of the current consumer society is {{the transformation of the}} environment into a <b>waste</b> <b>receptacle</b> arising from human activities. Because of the potential toxic effects of chromium solid waste containing this metal there are grounds for serious concern for the tanning and leather processing industry. The application of tannery waste as organic fertilizer has led to extensive contamination by chromium in agricultural areas and may cause the accumulation of this metal in soils and plants. This work evaluated the extraction of Cr+ 3 and Cr+ 6 contained in solid waste from the leather industry through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Gibbs free energy calculations reveal that the chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) forms more stable complexes with metal ions of chromium compared with the structures of the complexes [Cr(NTA) (H 2 O) 2] and [Cr-collagen], the latter used to simulate the protein bound chrome leather...|$|E

The increasing solid waste generation {{in the city of}} Bulawayo is evidenced by increased number of illegal dumping of waste in the urban communities. In this paper, a model that identifies cost-effective and efficient combinations of scientific and engineering tools to manage solid waste and also incorporating the key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics for solid waste management services has been designed. Literature on different types of waste management models, quantitative analysis of waste at Ross camp, direct observations made in the city locations and policy documents of the Zimbabwean Government (EMA acts), founded the development of this model. The design shows a clear depiction of the environmental management acts (EMA) and the municipality by-laws. Performance measurement which is very critical in waste management has been incorporated.
