500|$|The {{story of}} the golden crown {{does not appear in}} the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the {{practicality}} of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the <b>water</b> <b>displacement.</b> Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in hydrostatics as Archimedes' principle, which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. Galileo considered it [...] "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." [...] In a 12th-century text titled Mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance {{to solve the problem of}} the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.|$|E
2500|$|Tsunami can be {{generated}} when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water. Tectonic earthquakes are {{a particular kind of}} earthquake that are associated with the Earth's crustal deformation; when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea, the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position. [...] More specifically, a tsunami can {{be generated}} when thrust faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move abruptly, resulting in <b>water</b> <b>displacement,</b> owing to the vertical component of movement involved. Movement on normal (extensional) faults can also cause displacement of the seabed, but only the largest of such events (typically related to flexure in the outer trench swell) cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami, such as the 1977 Sumba and 1933 Sanriku events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{visual effects}} for Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis are {{predominantly}} produced by [...] Rainmaker Digital Effects, a notable visual-effects studio. [...] However, some effects, including the entire Ori battle sequence in the episode , were done [...] "in-house". [...] The unstable vortex effect, {{both in the}} film and the early seasons of the series, on account of being [...] "difficult to achieve" [...] was generated only once and recorded from various angles; this recording was the same used for all gate opening shots early in the series. [...] Rather than being a jet of water, it is actually the image of high-pressure air being blasted into a tank of water. The effect was achieved by mounting a jet airplane engine two feet above a water tank, and using its [...] windstream to create the sufficient <b>water</b> <b>displacement.</b> In post production, the surrounding water was removed with computer editing, {{and the image of}} the air-jet pasted {{into the center of the}} opening stargate. This technique was only used for earlier episodes, and the effect was replicated digitally soon after to allow more flexibility in shots.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{methods for}} delivering calibrated mechanical displacements to antennal mechanoreceptors in zooplankton while simultaneously recording related neural traffic. Mechanosensory neural responses to small <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> (0. 0 1 - 1 μm) were studied {{over a wide}} frequency range (30 to > 3000 Hz) Receptors could be localized and properties (thresholds, phase locking, habituation) examined. These methods have been tested on calanoid copepod first antennae (antennules), but may be suitable for other preparations. Extracellular recordings are made by holding the animal in stainless steel forceps and raising it into a layer of mineral oil, leaving {{one of the first}} antennae projecting into the underlying sea water. Nerve impulse traffic is recorded between the forceps and a chlorided silver wire in the seawater. Antennae are stimulated by <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> produced by a vibrating sphere attached to either an electromagnetic or piezoekctric transducer. A fiberoptic sensor continuously monitors displacement. A computer-controlled waveform generator and amplifier drive the transducer with various frequencies, amplitudes and waveforms. The amplified sensor output and neural activity are digitized for later analysi...|$|R
50|$|Because the 1600 km fault {{affected}} by the earthquake was in a nearly north-south orientation, the greatest strength of the tsunami waves was in an east-west direction. Bangladesh, which lies at {{the northern end of}} the Bay of Bengal, had very few casualties despite being a low-lying country relatively near the epicenter. It also benefited {{from the fact that the}} earthquake proceeded more slowly in the northern rupture zone, greatly reducing the energy of the <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> in that region.|$|R

40|$|Frogs swim by kicking water {{backwards}} with a synchronised {{extension of}} their hind limbs (Gray, 1968). The main forces acting during swimming are thrust from the backwards-moving webbed feet during the kick phase, and parasite {{drag on the}} forward-moving body during the kick {{as well as the}} retraction (glide) phase (Alexander, 2002; Nauwelaerts and Aerts, 2003). When looking at the overall swimming cycle, these forces should balance. In the absence of methods to quantify <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> and derive thrust forces directly, several modelling approaches have been used to map instantaneous propulsion throughout the kick-and-glide cycle in frogs and other self-propelling aquatic animals with a similar swimming style. These models were based on the thrust vs drag force balance that explained the movement of the centre of mass and were expressed i...|$|R
40|$|Frogs propel {{themselves}} by kicking water backwards using a synchronised extension of their hind limbs and webbed feet. To understand this propulsion process, we quantified the <b>water</b> movements and <b>displacements</b> resulting from {{swimming in the}} green frog Rana esculenta, applying digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to the frog’s wake. The wake showed two vortex rings {{left behind by the}} two feet. The rings appeared to be elliptic in planform, urging for correction of the observed ring radii. The rings’ long and short axes (average ratio 1. 75 : 1) were about {{the same size as the}} length and width of the propelling frog foot and the ellipsoid mass of water accelerated with it. Average thrust forces were derived from the vortex rings, assuming all propulsive energy to be compiled in the rings. The calculated average forces (Fav= 0. 10 ± 0. 04 N) were in close agreement with our parallel study applying a momentum–impulse approach to <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> during the leg extension phase. We did not find any support for previously assumed propulsion enhancement mechanisms. The feet do not clap together at the end of the power stroke and no ‘wedge-action’ jetting is observed. Each foot accelerates its own water mantle, ending up in a separate vortex ring without interference by the other leg. ...|$|R

40|$|Diffusion-based {{magnetic}} resonance imaging holds the potential to noninvasively demonstrate cellular-scale structural properties of brain. This method was applied to fixed baboon brains ranging from 90 to 185 days gestational age to characterize the changes in diffusion properties associated with brain development. Within each image voxel, a probability-theory-based approach was employed to choose, {{from a group of}} analytic equations, the one that best expressed <b>water</b> <b>displacements.</b> The resulting expressions contain eight or fewer adjustable parameters, indicating that relatively simple expressions are sufficient to obtain a complete description of the diffusion MRI signal in developing brain. The measured diffusion parameters changed systematically with gestational age, reflecting the rich underlying microstructural changes that take place during this developmental period. These changes closely parallel those of live, developing human brain. The information obtained from this primate model of cerebral microstructure is directly applicable to studies of human development...|$|R
50|$|The sensory epithelia of {{the inner}} ear are very {{specifically}} differentiated, enabling the olm to receive sound waves in the water, as well as vibrations from the ground. The complex functional-morphological orientation of the sensory cells enables the animal to register the sound sources. As this animal stays neotenic throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air, which is probably also possible for Proteus as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general. The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of Proteus is between 10 Hz and up to 15,000 Hz. The lateral line supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency nearby <b>water</b> <b>displacements.</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{interpretation}} of their environment, fish and aquatic amphibians have evolved a lateral line system that detects displacements in the local water field. Neuromasts are the basic unit of the lateral line system and consist of bundles of mechanoreceptive hair cells, which are comprised of a single kinocilium and numerous stereovilli protruding into a gelatinous cupula. The hydrodynamic properties of the neuromast act as a mechanical filter for sensory hair cells (van Netten, 1991). Hair cells are grouped into neuromasts located either upon the skin surface (superficial neuromasts) or enclosed within subdermal canals (canal neuromasts). Canal neuromasts function as water acceleration detectors, and superficial neuromasts act to determine water velocity (Kroese and Schellart, 1992). Behavioral and electrophysiological experiments have illustrated that the lateral line functions in schooling behavior (Partridge and Pitcher, 1980), rheotaxis (Montgomery et al., 1997) and localization of underwater objects (Weissert and von Campenhausen, 1981).

Given the pressures to develop offshore wind farms, {{there is an}} urgent need to assess population-level impacts on protected marine birds. Here we refine an approach to assess aspects of their ecology that influence population vulnerability to wind farm impacts, also {{taking into account the}} conservation importance of each species. Flight height appears to be a key factor influencing collision mortality risk but improved data on flight heights of marine birds are needed. Collision index calculations identify populations of gulls, white-tailed eagles, northern gannets and skuas as of particularly high concern in Scottish <b>waters.</b> <b>Displacement</b> index calculations identify populations of divers and common scoters as most vulnerable to population-level impacts of displacement, but these are likely to be less evident than impacts of collision mortality. The collision and displacement indices developed here for Scottish marine bird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere, and this approach will help in identifying likely impacts of future offshore wind farms on marine birds and prioritising monitoring programmes, at least until data on macro-avoidance rates become available...|$|R
50|$|Bunn-O-Matic {{also came}} out with a {{different}} drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200207 °F or 9397 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water {{to the bottom of the}} boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, <b>water</b> <b>displacement</b> method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the <b>water</b> <b>displacement</b> method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic coffee brewer, which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the surface Lagrangian residual circulation (LRC) over 2. 5 day intervals in the Iroise Sea, west of France, and evaluates, for operational purposes, {{the influence of}} the different physical mechanisms that govern it. The method consists of the calculation of <b>water</b> <b>displacements</b> with a diagnostic Lagrangian tool that computes the trajectories of numerical particles in a given velocity field. The LRC is inferred from trajectories integrated over five M 2 tidal cycles. The analysis is applied to both gridded genuine current measurements and ocean model outputs: the sea surface currents are derived from high‐frequency (HF) radar measurements and from MARS, a 3 ‐D regional ocean model used here in idealized configurations. To substantiate the analysis, the Lagrangian residual currents are also compared to genuine movements of drifters released in the Iroise Sea in 2005 and 2007. The LRC is mapped for typical scenarios identified from the Lagrangian analysis of HF radar surface currents measured in winter and summer, under weak (10 m/s) wind conditions, and in neap tide and spring tide seasons. Idealized numerical simulations that switch on and off each individual physical process are used to isolate in the LRC the patterns induced by the atmospheric forcing, tides, and density‐driven currents...|$|R
