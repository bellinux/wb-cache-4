500|$|After retiring, Grant {{became a}} less {{prominent}} public figure {{and focused on}} hunting and fishing and supporting environmental reforms. He has been a spokesperson against Native American hunting and fishing treaty rights in Minnesota. In 1993, Grant's efforts resulted in a death threat. In 2005, he spoke at a Capitol rally in Minnesota {{for the conservation of}} wetlands, wetland wildlife, and water. Grant addressed 5,000 supporters, saying, [...] "In this legislative session, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> action. It's more important than any stadium they could ever build in this state." ...|$|E
500|$|According to guitarist Huw Bunford {{the track}} had the working title [...] "Miami Vice" [...] as it {{featured}} a drum roll {{similar to one}} used in the theme tune to the 80's television show of the same name. The band decided not to keep this name as they were keen to avoid links with a particular place—Bunford gave {{the example of the}} song's use on a travel documentary about Miami as something the group did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Some</b> promotional copies of Phantom Power featured [...] "Slow Life" [...] as the first track although it eventually appeared as the last track on the officially released version of the album. Gruff Rhys has stated that the song had to go at either the beginning or the end of the record as it is the [...] "most sonically impressive" [...] track on the album. Rhys has described his lyrics as [...] "regurgitating what we hear on the news, recycled, vomiting them all back". The Guardian has interpreted the song as a [...] "cutting critique of middle-east colonialism".|$|E

500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> slasher movie.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Since around 1968, Presley {{wanted to}} make some changes and hoped to do a world tour, he remarked: [...] "Before too long I'm going to make some {{personal}} appearance tours. I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> places I've never seen before. I miss the personal contact with audiences." [...] However, throughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States—all of them in Canada (Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver), during brief tours there in 1957. Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. The real reason why Presley never toured abroad was probably because Parker feared that if he left the U.S., they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that Parker was an illegal immigrant born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands who left to go to the U.S. at the age of 29. Parker ultimately squelched any notions Presley had of working abroad, claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude.|$|E

Commenting on the {{difficulties}} of securing guests Gervais stated that [...] "either they'd heard of me or they hadn't. Either way it was a problem".|$|R
2500|$|On July 31, 2007 the City of Columbus filed {{a lawsuit}} to evict the {{management}} company, Simon Property Group, which held the lease on the underlying land, {{to gain control of}} the mall. [...] The city alleges that mall management grossly neglected the property, allowed it to fall into disrepair, did not pay real estate taxes for some time, and failed to make a rent payment for the land in excess of $200,000. Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman said of possible redevelopment for the property, [...] "I have many, many ideas, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> retail back in it, offices as well. We have thousands of people moving downtown and there's a great need for retail activity. Our downtown is on the move. This is the only thing holding us back.". In the last minutes before eviction was to take place, the city was able to negotiate a purchase agreement to buy the property from Simon and take over full control.|$|E
