5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the {{electron}} mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for a single electron moving around a heavy nucleus.|$|E

Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E

He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed {{he had no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used for.

25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to do the same to a human.|$|E
25|$|As the {{two women}} sip coffee Kitty admits {{she has to go}} to {{hospital}} for a few days and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E

25|$|The {{same two}} factors {{influence}} {{the direction of}} the effective gravity (as determined by a plumb line or as the perpendicular to the surface of water in a container). Anywhere on Earth away from the Equator or poles, effective gravity points not exactly toward the centre of the Earth, but rather perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} geoid, which, due to the flattened shape of the Earth, is somewhat toward the opposite pole. About half of the deflection is due to centrifugal force, and half because the extra mass around the Equator causes a change in {{the direction of the}} true gravitational force relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on a spherical Earth.|$|E
25|$|The up {{and down}} {{fluctuation}} of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if the aorta were not compliant. The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|The above {{result may}} or may not be {{perceived}} as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below) would certainly be required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.|$|E

500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been.</b> A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R

25|$|Applying these {{concepts}} {{to a whole}} sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains sente in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses sente and takes gote. Accepting gote should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the yose (endgame) can consist of playing available sente sequences, and then taking the largest gote sequence on the board, though that description is a simplification. A reverse sente play is a special type of gote play, preventing the opponent from making some sente move. The relative value of reverse sente plays depends on the overall position, but one can count it as twice the value of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if purely gote.|$|E

Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E
