5|$|After four seasons, Benfica proved {{ready to}} {{challenge}} for the European Cup in 1987–88. After eliminating teams like Anderlecht and Steaua București, they reached their sixth final in the competition, where they met PSV in a match played at Stuttgart's Neckarstadion, on 25 May 1988. Following a goalless draw {{at the end of}} extra-time, the match was decided by a penalty shootout. The Dutch team – fielding five Netherlands national football team players that would go on to conquer the UEFA Euro 1988 a month later – converted all of their penalty kicks, whereas António Veloso allowed goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen to defend his penalty kick, and secured Benfica's fourth consecutive European Cup final loss. Benfica did not <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> to make another appearance in the European Cup's showpiece match, as two years later – and with Swedish manager Eriksson again in charge – a team including Brazil's starting centre-backs, Ricardo Gomes and Aldair, together with midfielders Valdo and Jonas Thern, eliminated Marseille with a controversial handled goal from Vata to reach their seventh European Cup final. Before the final, Eusébio visited Béla Guttmann's grave, asking for forgiveness in hope of ending the curse. On 23 May 1990, Benfica faced title-holders Milan at Vienna's Praterstadion and were unable to prevent Frank Rijkaard to score the winning goal and give the Italian side its fourth and second consecutive European Cup title.|$|E
5|$|With the RUF rapidly {{advancing}} on Freetown {{and controlling}} {{most of the}} interior of Sierra Leone, {{the only means of}} rapidly evacuating entitled persons or reinforcing UNAMSIL was by air via Lungi airport. Thus, the enhanced 1 PARA was flown to Dakar on 7 May, where C Company and the special forces squadron were almost immediately put aboard RAF Hercules C-130s with orders to secure the airport. They arrived at Lungi before sunset and were joined by the remaining elements of 1 PARA the next morning. The soldiers were able to deploy rapidly and with minimal equipment, knowing that they would not have to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> for the ARG's reinforcements and supplies should they be needed. The soldiers immediately set about securing the areas that would be vital to an evacuation, including the Mamy Yoko hotel, which became the evacuation centre, and Lungi airport. Jones requested in the afternoon of 8 May that Richards commence the evacuation—codenamed Operation Palliser—which Richards did almost immediately. Entitled persons who wished to leave were instructed to assemble at the Mamy Yoko hotel. From there, they would be helicoptered to the airport by Chinooks and then flown to Dakar.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{probably}} could not <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> to replace Richard, as the Welsh were resurgent under the charismatic leadership of Gruffudd ap Cynan. According to the Historia Regum, Richard's death prompted the Welsh to raid Cheshire, looting, killing, and burning two castles. Perhaps {{because of his}} recognised military ability and social strength, because he was loyal {{and because he was}} the closest male relation to Earl Richard, Henry recognized Ranulf as Richard's successor to the county of Chester.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} {{the first member of}} Destiny's Child to release a solo album in 2002 (Heart to Yours), Williams did not <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> to start work on its follow-up in 2003.

Before taking over the lead role in the Broadway musical Aida on November 18, 2003, Williams began working on the album.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to <b>wait</b> <b>long,</b> and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E

25|$|With the French Revolution of 1790 making war inevitable, the Navy again {{expanded}} and Harvey {{was subject to}} special request from Admiral Lord Howe who desired him to command the new and powerful 74-gun ship of the line HMS Brunswick in the Channel Fleet. The Channel Fleet was not forced to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> before joining action, Britain going to war in 1793 {{and a year later}} becoming embroiled {{in the battle of the}} Glorious First of June, an engagement intended to cut off France's grain supply from the young United States. Howe had been chasing the French fleet protecting the convoy for some days, and several short and sharp actions had been fought without conclusion. On 1 June 1794 however, Howe finally gained the wind on the French and overhauled them in a long line of battle.|$|E
25|$|The replay {{was played}} {{in front of}} a small but very vocal Boro crowd who were fired up by an {{unfortunately}} worded letter from the club seemingly asking them to sit down and be quiet in their last home game. The fans didn't have to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> for a goal as in the fifth minute Stewart Downing curled an unstoppable free-kick over the wall and into the top-right hand corner of the net. Tuncay doubled the lead with a volley as West Ham's defense failed to clear the ball. The visitors dominated the possession but could not convert it to goals, and with Middlesbrough threatening on the counterattack, they couldn't afford to neglect their defensive duties. In the end, the 2–0 was enough to see Middlesbrough through to the last eight for the fourth consecutive season.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step up and take on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Whittall {{made his}} Test debut on 1 December 1993 against Pakistan in the Defence Housing Authority Stadium. Zimbabwe {{would go on}} to lose the game by 131 runs and Whittall contributed an innings of 33 and the wicket of Basit Ali. He would not have to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> to make his mark, with his maiden Test century coming in just his 6th Test. At Harare Sports Club in February 1995, Whittall scored an unbeaten 113 to help his side to a {{historic}} first-ever Test victory, against the Pakistanis. Two years later he wrote his name into the record books with an unbeaten 203 at Queens Sports Club against New Zealand. Whittall was well short of his double ton when the number 11 Everton Matambanadzo came to bat. The New Zealanders did their bit to help, giving field placings designed to give easy singles thus giving Matambanadzo the strike. The milestone eventually came with a boundary through the slips.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Cambridge University against Warwickshire on 24 April 1971. He opened the batting, making 10 and 3, and bowled without success as Warwickshire won by 109 runs. However, Edmonds {{would not have}} to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> for success. In the following match against Leicestershire, he would record his first 5-wicket haul in an innings, taking 5/50, and back up with 4/48 in the second innings to help Cambridge University to a seven-wicket win. After taking 7/56 in the first innings of the annual University Match against Oxford University, finishing the match with his first 10-wicket haul in a first-class match, Edmonds made his debut for Middlesex in a thrilling match against Essex at Lord's Cricket Ground on August 4. He bowled solidly, returning figures of 2/51 and 3/42, and was the last batsman in with Middlesex still needing 16 runs off the final two overs to win. In the end, Middlesex ran out of time and had to defend the final ball to escape with a draw, which they managed.|$|E
25|$|In June 1916, the {{battalion}} {{was transferred to}} the European theatre along with the other battalions of the four Australian infantry divisions that were in the Middle East at that time and they arrived in France {{at the end of the}} month. Following this, the 55th Battalion took its place in the trenches along the Western Front in mid-July, amidst heavy fighting on the Somme. The battalion did not have to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> before they experienced their first engagement of the campaign, being committed to the Battle of Fromelles a week later on 19 July. Initially they were placed in reserve, but as the attack stalled, the 55th Battalion was tasked with providing the rearguard for the withdrawal of the assault formations. After spending the winter in the trenches on the Somme, in 1917 they took part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line that followed the German withdrawal that had been affected as part of a German plan to shorten their lines and free up reserves. The battalion then played a defensive role in the Second Battle of Bullecourt before moving to Ypres in Belgium where they took part in the Battle of Polygon Wood on 26 September 1917.|$|E

500|$|After Lewis's departure, {{the program}} hit {{an all-time low}} in 1960 under first-year head coach Gene Corum, posting its worst season to date: 0–8–2. The Mountaineers were simply outclassed by their opponents, being outscored 40–259 on the season. [...] The Mountaineers rebounded, however, and by 1962 were back to their winning ways, posting an 8–2 record and 4–0 conference record. Despite their undefeated conference record, once again the SoCon crown eluded the Mountaineers {{in favor of the}} VMI Keydets and their 6–0 record in conference play. [...] West Virginia did not have to <b>wait</b> <b>long</b> for its next SoCon title, however, as the program won the title in the 1964 and 1965 seasons consecutively. [...] The Mountaineers {{finished}} 7–4 in 1964 and participated in the Liberty Bowl against Utah, West Virginia's first bowl game in 11 years as well as the first major college football bowl game ever played indoors and to be broadcast nationwide in the United States. Corum's tenure ended thereafter, posting a 29–30–2 record over his six seasons as head coach. Corum's legacy went well beyond wins and losses, however, as he integrated WVU football in 1963 with the program's first African-American recruits in Roger Alford and Dick Leftridge.|$|E
