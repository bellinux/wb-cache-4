The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70–100kg/ML of <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3).

50|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} {{is proportional to the}} amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks (if {{they are part of the}} process configuration) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110-170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70-100 kg/ML of <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60-100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180-270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge.</b>|$|E

The handling and disposal of this sludge accounts for more than 40 % of operational costs in a typical waste water treatment plant (WWTP). There were 26, 000 tonnes of dry sludge produced in Melbourne during the years 2009 - 2010 according to the annual report by Melbourne Water and $ 43 million has been invested in Western Treatment Plant to improve the sludge treatment. 5840 tonnes of the sludge was collected and sent to a landfill for disposal, at a total cost of $ 494, 210. Therefore, attention has been given to modifications to the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> process with potential for minimization of excess sludge.

Ultrasound {{can be used as a}} pretreatment method for <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge.</b> It has a disintegrating effect on the sludge and causes lysis of bacteria in the sludge.

Ultrasonic degassing of sewage sludge has not been examined previously. The present study aims to investigate the effect of ultrasound on <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> as well as the potential of ultrasound to speed up the degassing of digested sludge. A semi-continuous, lab-scale digestion experiment was performed with four reactors: two receiving untreated sludge and two receiving treated sludge. The effect of the sonicator was 420 W and the treatment time was 6 min, which corresponds to an energy input of 8. 4 kWh/m 3. Total solids (TS) of the <b>waste</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> was ~ 3. 5 %. The ultrasonic treatment caused an increase in gas production of 13 %. There was no difference in methane content. The concentration of filterable chemical oxygen demand (fCOD) increased 375 %, or from 2. 8 % to 11 % of total COD. In terms of energy loss/gain the increase in gas production resulted in a loss of 2. 7 kWh/m 3, i. e. more energy is needed to treat the sludge than the potential energy of the increased gas production. However, if the sludge is thickened to a TS > 5 %, a net energy gain should be reached. The effect of ultrasound on the degassing of digested sludge was examined in three barrels. The degassing was measured with and without circulation as well as with ultrasonic treatment. The digested sludge had a gas emission rate of 115 L/(m 3 day). No direct burst of gas occurred due to ultrasonic treatment. Over two days more gas was emitted from the barrel equipped with ultrasound, probably due to an induced post-digestion.

The samples were all negative for Salmonella spp. From total of 99 (49, 5 %) strains Listeria spp., Listeria innocua 92 (46 %) and L. monocytogenes 7 (3, 5 %) were identified. 47 samples were positive for S. aureus. L. monocytogenes and S. aureus were detected in raw waste water 1 (1, 6 %) and 14 (22, 6 %), in <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> 3 (5, 5 %) and 23 (41, 8 %), in excess sludge 1 and 1, in treated water 2 (3, 1 %) and 8 (12, 3 %). These results demonstrate a prevalence of L. innocua and S. aureus in waste waters from dairies. During cleaning process pathogenic bacteria were not devitalized.

40|$|The {{operation}} without <b>sludge</b> <b>wasting</b> from <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> {{processes for}} wastewater was studied {{by increasing the}} solid retention time (SRT) as long as possible. Two sets of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> processes were prepared: one was an usual activated process with 8 hours detention time. To another was added an anaerobic tank with 2 hour detention time, to observe the effects of an anaerobic condition on sludge production. Both processes treated the effluent from a primary settling tank of a {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} in Fukui City, Japan, and were operated for about 160 days without withdrawing any excess sludge. After the MLSS was accumulated to around 10, 000 mg/L, both processes were suffered from the washout of sludge from the sedimentation tank, and the quality of effluent was not very bad. The anaerobic tank appeared to have little influence on sludge reduction. The experimental results implied that it was proper to maintain the MLSS below a certain concentration...|$|R
