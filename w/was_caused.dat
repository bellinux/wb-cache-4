5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E

5|$|Despite never officially {{reaching}} typhoon strength, Bilis {{was responsible}} for $4.4billion (2006 USD) in damage and 859 fatalities in the Philippines, Taiwan, and China.

Many of the areas Bilis flooded were later affected by Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and intense Typhoon Saomai.|$|E

40|$|Ehrlichiosis is a {{group of}} diseases, usually named {{according}} to the host species and the type of white blood cell most often infected. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia canis and, occasionally, E. chaffeensis. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii. Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis/Potomac horse fever <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Neorickettsia risticii (formerly Ehrlichia risticii).
