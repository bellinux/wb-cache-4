50|$|Jones' post Formula One {{career was}} {{initially}} spasmodic in nature. Briefly {{in demand for}} his services as a Touring Car co-driver, he raced occasionally in his home country's biggest endurance race, the Bathurst 1000 but success was elusive. In 1982 he attempted his first full season of racing, driving a Porsche 935 to dominate the 1982 Australian GT Championship. This championship included races against local touring car ace Peter Brock driving Bob Jane's 6.0 litre Chevrolet Monza. The duels between Australia's two biggest motorsport names at the time have often been regarded {{as some of the}} best racing seen domestically in Australia. Soon after he made his first failed comeback to Formula One. During 1982 he formed his own touring Car team, combining the resources of V8 Ford Falcon driver Bob Morris and rotary Mazda RX-7 racer Barry Jones into a single two-car team but results were mixed and the exercise dissipated {{by the end of the}} season, though Jones and Jones did win the CRC 300 at Amaroo Park in a Mazda RX-7 (Alan Jones was to drive with Bob Morris in the Falcon in the Oran Park 250 endurance race, but elected after the race started to let Morris drive the 100 lap race solo. Morris went on to win the race). 1984 brought a top six finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Kremer Racing, and a top four finish at the Bathurst 1000, again teaming with Warren Cullen in a Holden VK Commodore. Cullen and Jones, who drove the final stint in the race and required pain killing injections after having the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>wrench</b> out of his hands during practice which damaged ligaments in his elbow, were unlucky not to finish 2nd, but a brake problem with the car saw him forced to use more fuel than normal and a late race stop for fuel allowed the Holden Dealer Team VK Commodore of David Parsons and John Harvey to sneak into 2nd and the Mazda RX-7 of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford to claim 3rd.|$|E
5000|$|Jeffrey [...] "Jeff" [...] Thisted (born October 10, 1968 in Brunswick, Maine) is an American {{television}} presenter, {{game show}} host and Car-Guy. He's {{currently on the}} Discovery Channel show Rods 'N <b>Wheels</b> <b>wrenching</b> on hot rods. He's served {{as one of the}} hosts on GSN's interactive game show Quiznation in the PlayMania Block. He made his hosting debut presiding over one game on the May 18, 2007 episode of Quiznation and finished in October before the finale. He was the only male host on the PlayMania Block. Before it was cancelled, he also served as host on 100 Winners.|$|R
50|$|Since around 1910, {{drivers and}} cyclists have {{reported}} suffering unusual accidents {{along the road}} between Postbridge and Two Bridges. In many cases, the victims reported that their vehicle had jolted or swerved violently and steered {{off the side of}} the road, as if something had taken hold of the <b>wheels</b> and <b>wrenched</b> it out of their control.|$|R
50|$|Sylvie {{is clearly}} troubled and we {{discover}} {{that she has}} suffered a miscarriage, the father being someone she had known sometime before Michael. Whilst travelling across Germany in a car Sylvie and Michael start playfighting, Sylvie then takes the <b>wheel</b> and unexpectedly <b>wrenches</b> the <b>wheel</b> causing them to deliberately crash.|$|R
50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle <b>wheel.</b> Cone <b>wrenches</b> are thinner and lighter than most other open ended wrenches {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer axle nuts may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|R
50|$|A {{spoke wrench}} or spoke key {{is a small}} wrench or tool used to adjust {{the tension in the}} spokes of a bicycle wheel, sulky wheel, {{wheelchair}} wheel, or similar <b>wheel.</b> A spoke <b>wrench</b> is sometimes called a nipple wrench, as it is the spoke nipple - not the spoke - that is turned in the process of changing the tension of a spoke.|$|R
60|$|Through {{this vast}} throng, {{sprinkled}} doubtless {{here and there}} with honest zealots, but composed {{for the most part}} of the very scum and refuse of London, whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws, bad prison regulations, and the worst conceivable police, such of the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not taken the precaution to be already at their posts, were compelled to fight and force their way. Their carriages were stopped and broken; the <b>wheels</b> <b>wrenched</b> off; the glasses shivered to atoms; the panels beaten in; drivers, footmen, and masters, pulled from their seats and rolled in the mud. Lords, commoners, and reverend bishops, with little distinction of person or party, were kicked and pinched and hustled; passed from hand to hand through various stages of ill-usage; and sent to their fellow-senators at last with their clothes hanging in ribands about them, their bagwigs torn off, themselves speechless and breathless, and their persons covered with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair. One lord was so long {{in the hands of the}} populace, that the Peers as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him, and were in the act of doing so, when he happily appeared among them covered with dirt and bruises, and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him best. The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment. The air was filled with execrations, hoots, and howlings. The mob raged and roared, like a mad monster as it was, unceasingly, and each new outrage served to swell its fury.|$|R
50|$|Missing {{from the}} grid was an injured Niki Lauda. At {{the end of}} Friday's {{practice}} session before qualifying proper, his McLaren MP4/2B's throttle struck open while he was only touring back to the pits. The car slid off the track on the newer section of track and the three time and defending World Champion hit a guardrail and on impact the steering <b>wheel</b> whipped around <b>wrenching</b> his wrist as it did so. X-rays revealed no break but Lauda was not fit to race so he returned home to Austria for further inspection and treatment from his physical therapist Willi Dungl. McLaren initially hoped to put John Watson in Lauda's car but this would have required the approval of all other teams. Mindful of the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari refused to agree, leaving Alain Prost as McLaren's only driver in Belgium. RAM was also down to one car, only bringing a single RAM 03 for Philippe Alliot and the 1985 Formula 3000 champion Christian Danner made his world championship debut with Zakspeed.|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the <b>wheel</b> against the <b>wrench's</b> turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
