40|$|The {{education}} of inspector of <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures at the Delft School of Engineering (1843 - 1963)   The Kingdom of the United Netherlands {{was the first}} state in the world which introduced the Metric System in 1820 through the 1816 Act of <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures. At first education for the <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures inspectors was not available. After King William II founded the Royal Academy engineering school in Delft in 1842, the school's first director, Antoine Lipkens, who {{took an interest in}} <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures himself, seized the opportunity to establish a course for inspectors of <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures in his school. In this two-year course students were trained to become the highest officials in the national Service of <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> Measures. The programme was of high quality and continuously adapted to the current state of technology and to the various <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures Acts. The <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures inspectors were qualified and all-round experts. Nevertheless, after the Second World War their work became so complex that specialists from different fields in technical colleges and universities took over their tasks. The occupation of inspector of <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> measures became redundant. Attempts to create a university level education for the inspectors failed. In 1963 the Delft engineering school closed the doors to this programme, which was the end of a unique type of education for a unique occupation. 79...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on feed forward neural network (FFNN) {{optimization}} by particle swarm intelligence (PSI) used to provide initial <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases to train neural network. Once the <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases are found using Particle swarm optimization (PSO) with neural network used as training algorithm for specified epoch, the same are used to train the neural network for training and classification of benchmark problems. Further the approach is tested for offline signature classifications. A comparison is made between normal FFNN with random <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases and FFNN with particle swarm optimized <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases. Firstly, the performance is tested on two benchmark databases for neural network, The Breast Cancer Database and the Diabetic Database. Result shows that neural network performs better with initial <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases obtained by Particle Swarm optimization. The network converges faster with PSO obtained initial <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> biases for FFNN and classification accuracy is increased...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{stochastic}} {{programs with}} first-stage binary variables and capacity constraints, using simple penalties for capacities violations. In particular, {{we take a}} closer look at the knapsack problem with <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> capacity following independent random variables and prove that the problem is weakly NP -hard in general. We provide pseudo-polynomial algorithms for three special cases of the problem: constant <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> capacity uniformly distributed, subset sum with Gaussian <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> strictly positively distributed random capacity, and subset sum with constant <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> arbitrary random capacity. We then turn to a branch-and-cut algorithm based on the outer approximation of the objective function. We provide computational results for the stochastic knapsack problem (i) with Gaussian <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> constant capacity and (ii) with constant <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> capacity uniformly distributed, on randomly generated instances inspired by computational results for the knapsack problem.

5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} {{study conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside <b>weight,</b> <b>and</b> 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat <b>weight</b> <b>and</b> size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.
