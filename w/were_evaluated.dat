In a council meeting on 23 November, seven candidates <b>were</b> <b>evaluated,</b> but no agreement was reached on whether to prefer a candidate for academic teaching abilities or musical performance. The first council document with Bach named as a candidate dates from 21 December, together with Christoph Graupner. Of all candidates, Bach {{was the only one}} without a university education.|$|E
5|$|From 2008 to 2012, {{the company}} hosted the Triumph Inspiration Awards, where {{lingerie}} designers {{were able to}} compete according to an annually changing theme. The entries <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> both by a jury {{and according to the}} votes by visitors to the competition website. In 2009, the competition attracted broader attention, particularly as that event was held in London. Initially a local competition was held in the participating countries prior to the international final competition.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{vehicles}} <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA). The four primary vehicles {{included in}} the AOA were the M2A3 Bradley II, a modernized Stryker, an M2A3 Bradley variant used in Iraq, and a XM1230 Caiman Plus MRAP. The five secondary vehicles included two unnamed foreign-made platforms, the M1126 Stryker Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the M1A2 SEP TUSK Abrams, and a modernized M1 Abrams. Vehicles included the AOA were determined to be inferior to the planned GCV.|$|E
30|$|A policy <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> {{by first}} {{evaluating}} its target. If the policy {{does not apply}} to the request, NotApplicable is returned. If the policy does apply, its condition <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> (in case of an atomic policy) or its sub-policies <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> (in case of a composed policy) and the result is returned. For composed policies, the sub-policies <b>are</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the given order; as a consequence, the policy tree <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> depth-first. For now, we assume all sub-policies and expressions to <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> sequentially.|$|R
5000|$|Once literals have <b>been</b> <b>evaluated,</b> further {{semantic}} {{analysis in the}} form of constant folding is possible, meaning that literal expressions involving literal values can <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> at the compile phase. For example, in the statement [...] after the literals have <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> and the expression [...] has been parsed, it can then <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> to 4, though the value 4 does not itself appear as a literal.|$|R

On {{the end of}} the year approximately 50% of the funding goal was achieved and it was decided to continue the funding campaign without deadlines. The money went to ReactOS Deutschland e.V.. As the tax law in Germany for this form of a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein) makes it problematic to pay developers directly, indirect possibilities like stipends <b>were</b> <b>evaluated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E

She {{was one of the}} artists that founded the London Group. According to author Kate Deepwell, her works, and those of Vanessa Bell and other women, <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> differently at that time than those made by men: The best critique of woman's work at the time would be that they had individuality, but they would not have been considered innovative, modern works like those made by men.|$|E
5000|$|Assume {{the simple}} {{calculator}} from before. The equation system [...] "A=B; B=D+C; C=D+A; D=12;" [...] contains a circular dependency formed by A, B and C, as B must <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> before A, C must <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> before B and A must <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> before C.|$|R
5000|$|This {{assumes that}} the {{polynomial}} <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> in monomial form and no preconditioning of the representation is allowed, which makes sense if the polynomial <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> only once. However, if preconditioning is allowed and the polynomial <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> many times, then faster algorithms are possible. They involve a transformation of {{the representation of the}} polynomial. In general, a degree-n polynomial can <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> using only [...] multiplications and n additions.|$|R

5|$|The Los Angeles Athletic Club {{released}} its annual preseason John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 13. The list {{was composed of}} 50 student athletes who, based on 2007–08's individual performance and team records, were the early frontrunners for college basketball's most coveted trophy. These top 50 candidates were returning players. Transfers, freshmen, and medical red-shirts were not eligible for this preseason list, but <b>were</b> <b>evaluated</b> and considered for both the Midseason Top 30 list and the National Ballot. The Big Ten was represented by Purdue's Hummel, Wisconsin's Landry and Michigan State's Morgan.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{eager evaluation}} or greedy evaluation is the evaluation strategy used by most traditional programming languages. In eager evaluation, an expression <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> {{as soon as}} it is bound to a variable.
