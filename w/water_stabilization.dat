Surprisingly, fresh exponentially grown (PDADMAC-PAA) (n) polyelectrolyte films behave as glassy materials with Young moduli as large as 2 MPa. Their organization is governed by a competition between PDADMAC-PAA electrostatic interactions and <b>water</b> <b>stabilization</b> of PAA charges that limits association between polycationic and polyanionic chains. At pH 3 where PAA is weakly deprotonated, this competition leads {{to the formation of}} water-free PDADMAC-PAA polyelectrolyte complexes within well-defined donut-like structures (2 - 12 mu m in diameter, 100 - 200 nm in height) that confer upon the film a mechanical rigidity comparable to that classically achieved for linearly growing films. The relaxation of (PDADMAC-PAA) (n) films to equilibrium occurs over 5 days and is marked by a gradual disappearance of all donut-like structures, resulting in a 3 -fold decrease of the Young modulus. This mechanical softening of the film is significantly accelerated by increasing the diffusion rate of PDADMAC and PAA chains upon heating: the morphological and mechanical features of the 5 -day old, naturally aged films are recovered after 2 h heating treatment at 60 degrees C. In combination, this invokes a transition from intrinsic to extrinsic film charge compensation; i. e., the tightly compacted polyelectrolyte complexes progressively change to coacervates that are loosely associated by electrostatics. It is shown that such atypical structure transition of exponentially grown films can be used for reversible laser-assisted printing applications at microscales...|$|E
40|$|From 1986 to 1988 eight cruises were {{conducted}} in the Barents Sea, covering Atlantic water in central parts of the Sea and meltwater and Arctic water in the Polar front region. During the cruises hydrography, nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and abundances of life stages of the three Calanus species; C. finmarchicus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus, were mapped. From this, development and spawning of the copepods in different water masses {{were related to the}} timing and progress of the phytoplankton spring bloom. In central parts of the Atlantic <b>water</b> <b>stabilization</b> was caused by formation of a thermocline due to atmospheric warming and the process was time dependent. Phytoplankton spring bloom development was closely related to water column stability. Rates of egg production of the female populations of C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis showed strong correlations with chlorophyll content, indicating a functional relationship between spawning and food supply. In the meltwater region water column stabilization was caused by ice melting, which is not purely a time dependent process. However, also in this region a close relationship between phytoplankton spring bloom development and spawning of C. glacialis was found. Spawning of C. finmarchicus was out of phase with the spring bloom and peaked during the post-bloom period. This was explained by a retarded development of the overwintered stock of C. finmarchicus in the meltwater region. In Arctic water development seemed to be slower for both species. Thus, mis-match between the phytoplankton bloom and spawning of C. finmarchicus due to retarded development is suggested as the main factor making this species an expatriate of the northern Barents Sea. In C. glacialis a two-year life cycle in the warmer parts of the Barents Sea, may result in a too long life span relative to the mortality rate of this area, and the species may be expatriated in the southern Barents Sea. C. hyperboreus was found to spawn in January and February, or earlier, well before the spring bloom. The nauplii, however, did not develop beyond stage NIII which is the first feeding stage until the food concentrations increased during the spring bloom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the phytoplankton bloom {{and its relation to}} the <b>water</b> column <b>stabilization</b> duringthe transition from early to high summer (of 1991) in the seasonally ice covered zone of the Barents Sea isstudied from a meridional transect of repeated hydrographic/biological stations. The <b>water</b> column <b>stabilization</b> isdescribed in detail with the aid of vertical profiles of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency squared (N 2). The contributionsof seasonal warming and ice melting to the stabilization are elucidated by determining the effects of temperatureand salinity on N 2. The spring bloom in 1991 migrated poleward from June to July by about 400 km, associated with the retreat ofthe ice edge. The spring bloom culminated with maximum chlorophyll concentrations in the mixed layer about 100 - 300 km north of the centre of the meltwater lense, at its northern edge, where the ice cover was stillsubstantial. From the distribution of N 2 it becomes obvious that the bloom starts {{at the very beginning of}} stabilization whichresults solely from the release of meltwater. The increase of temperature due to the seasonal warming does notcontribute to the onset of the vernal blooming; temperature starts to contribute to the stratification later, when thespring bloom already has ceased due to the exhaustion of nutrients in the mixed layer. At that time a deepchlorophyll maximum has formed in the seasonal pycnocline, 20 - 30 m below the base of the mixed layer.

40|$|Abstract Gradient, {{which is}} largely {{considered}} {{to be related to}} water level in mires, is referred to as a microtopographic mud bottom to carpet to lawn to hummock level gradient or the hummock level to intermediate level (lawn) to flark level gradient. The relationship of this vegetation gradient to various physical water level characteristics was studied. The general classification used in the present summary paper divides the aro vegetation of the inland of Northern Ostrobothnia into two main groups: (a) treeless fen aro vegetation (Juncus supinus, Carex lasiocarpa, Rhynchospora fusca, Molinia caerulea) and (b) heath aro vegetation (Polytrichum commune). The first group (a) was divided into fen aro wetlands with an approximately 10 cm peaty layer at most and into aro fens with a peat layer thicker than 10 cm. The treatment of the water level gradient was divided into three main groups. (1) The mean water level correlated with mire surface levels (microtopographic gradient) within mires with slight water level fluctuations and partly within mires with considerable water level fluctuations. (2) Three habitat groups could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} range of water level fluctuation i. e. mires with slight water level fluctuations, mires with considerable water level fluctuations and the aro vegetation with extreme water level fluctuations. (3) The timing of water level fluctuations indicated that there are different types of patterns within aro wetlands, the seasonal pattern being mainly a response to yearly snow melt and the several-year-fluctuation pattern being related to the regional groundwater table fluctuation in mineral soils (heath forests). A link was suggested between the stability of the water regime and peat production in local aapa mire – aro wetland environments. From the point of view of peatland plants the direction of variation from a stable to an unstable water regime in aapa mire – aro wetland environments represents a transition towards more and more harsh ecological conditions, partly forming a gradient through natural disturbance. A qualitative functional model was provided for the mire – aro wetland systems of Northern Ostrobothnia. The model supposes differences in the characteristics of peat between two functional complexes within a mire system. Finally, the model for local mire – aro wetland systems was converted to a general from: diplotelmic (acrotelm) mires were divided into two subtypes (diplotelmic <b>water</b> <b>stabilization</b> mires, diplotelmic water fluctuation mires) and the relationship of those subtypes to percolation mires and seasonal wetlands was considered...|$|E
