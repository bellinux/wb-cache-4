The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> by Narihira, and had a higher proportion of fiction to fact. The third and final stage saw some later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.|$|E

In a 2011 comparison, Doug Henschen of InformationWeek found that start-up {{fees for the}} three are similar, though he admitted that the starting fees <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the best basis for comparison. SAS' business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs, instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E

The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{includes}} three sections: the wide atrium (or courtyard), the narthex and the cella (also naos or, {{due to its}} shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that a reconstruction of the church was carried out some time after its completion. Mavrodinov and archaeologist Karel Škorpil believe the narthex and cella comprised the first building period, while the atrium was added very shortly after that and by the same architect.|$|E
5|$|The {{forces of}} Chōshū and Satsuma were fully modernized with Armstrong guns, Minié rifles and one Gatling gun. The Shogunate forces had been {{slightly}} lagging {{in term of}} equipment, although the French military mission to Japan (1867–1868) had recently trained a core elite force. The Shogun also relied on troops supplied by allied domains, which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> as advanced in terms of military equipment and methods, composing an army that had both modern and outdated elements.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} women <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> common, {{though they}} were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E
5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E

25|$|The {{claim is}} {{made that the}} true Ecclesiastical power in the Celtic world lay {{in the hands of}} abbots of monasteries, rather than the Bishop of Diocesess. It is certain that the ideal of monasticism was universally esteemed in Celtic Christianity. This was {{especially}} true in Ireland and areas evangelised by Irish missionaries, where monasteries and their abbots came to be vested {{with a great deal of}} ecclesiastical and secular power. Following the growth of the monastic movement in the 6th century, Abbots controlled not only individual monasteries, but also expansive estates and the secular communities that tended them. As monastics, abbots <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> ordained (i.e. they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> priests or bishops). They were usually descended from one of the many Irish royal families, and the founding regulations of the Abbey sometimes specified that the Abbotcy should if possible be kept within one family lineage.|$|E
