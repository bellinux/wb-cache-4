5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} <b>washing</b> <b>process</b> immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
25|$|Belt {{filters are}} less {{effective}} at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs. Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the <b>washing</b> <b>process.</b> The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time. Water and time wastage, {{as well as the}} associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using effluents.|$|E
25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} <b>washing</b> <b>process</b> {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E

25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the <b>washing</b> <b>process,</b> biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E
6000|$|Note: Some of {{the phrases}} {{in the above}} are mining technicalities, purely, and {{may be a little}} obscure to the general reader. In [...] "placer diggings" [...] the gold is {{scattered}} all through the surface dirt; in [...] "pocket" [...] diggings it is concentrated in one little spot; in [...] "quartz" [...] the gold is in a solid, continuous vein of rock, enclosed between distinct walls of some other kind of stone--and this is the most laborious and expensive of all the different kinds of mining. [...] "Prospecting" [...] is hunting for a [...] "placer"; [...] "indications" [...] are signs of its presence; [...] "panning out" [...] refers to the <b>washing</b> <b>process</b> by which the grains of gold are separated from the dirt; a [...] "prospect" [...] is what one finds in the first panful of dirt--and its value determines whether it is a good or a bad prospect, and whether it is worth while to tarry there or seek further.|$|E

50|$|A jet spray washer cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the power <b>wash</b> <b>process</b> the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the primary cleaning mechanism. A parts washer utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the power <b>wash</b> <b>process</b> is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet spray process. All things considered the power <b>wash</b> <b>process</b> is superior to the jet spray process for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The power <b>wash</b> <b>process</b> is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional power wash types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a comprehensive package of quality assurance criteria for use by industry and regulatory authorities for ensuring the quality and safety-in-use (sensory, microbiological and chemical) of reused plastics for food packaging. The study included thermal degradation effects, flavour carry-over caused by flavour and off-flavour substances, the influence of <b>washing</b> <b>processes</b> on the materials, and the efficiency of <b>washing</b> <b>processes</b> in removing off-flavour substances and surrogate substances representing misuse chemicals as might be put in bottles by consumers. The microbial safely of the refillable plastic articles in relation to commercial <b>washing</b> <b>processes</b> and the industrial procedures applied has also been investigated. Lastly, the suitability of laboratory procedures using strips of bottle material for predicting the sorption and washing properties of refillable plastic bottles has been studied. In general it is concluded that reuse of the articles does not significantly influence any of the properties investigated. Neither the chemical, physical nor surface properties seem to be significantly influenced by repeated washing. It can be concluded, however, that it is very likely that most of the articles investigated will cause flavour carry-over to a new filling if they are contaminated with strongly flavoured products. Finally it can be concluded that the procedures evaluated can serve as a basis for future legislation on refillable articles, but for several procedures (like quick predictive testing with strips) more investigation is required to create a more solid basis.
