Neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements have been done for heavy nuclear targets such as iron and lead. In order to extract structure functions of the nucleon, one needs to remove nuclear effects from the data. However, recent studies indicate that there are inconsistencies in nuclear modifications between charged-lepton and neutrino scattering measurements. Nuclear medium effects could be also an origin for the NuTeV anomaly in the <b>weakmixing</b> <b>angle.</b> In addition, the modifications could affect neutrino-oscillation experiments because some DIS events of neutrino-oxygen nucleus interactions are contained. On the other hand, the nuclear medium effects themselves are interesting and important for describing nuclei in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom...|$|E
