2500|$|... 2011: Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton: Around 5,000 Metropolitan Police {{officers}} were deployed {{to police the}} wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011. In advance of the event, assistant commissioner Lynne Owens said: [...] "People who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> London to peacefully protest can do that but they must remember {{that it is a}} day of national celebration". Approximately one hundred people were pre-emptively arrested in advance of the wedding and were detained without charge {{for the duration of the}} wedding, with the apparent aim of suppressing protest. Other protestors were arrested on the day of the wedding; some were detained at railway stations on arrival. The Metropolitan Police said that one million people were present in London to watch the wedding procession.|$|E
2500|$|After filming Cobra, {{the cast}} of The Hooded Falcon sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they {{returned}} to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. [...] "I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his chin. My heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> life until the judgement day," [...] was soon printed in Photoplay. The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with Ritz-Carlton.|$|E

2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E
