Proponents of card check recognition argue that reliance on National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) organizing procedures fails to protect employees 2 ̆ 7 rights to organize, and forces unions to compete against a stacked deck that unfairly favors employers. Indeed, the labor movement in the United States has long been dissatisfied with the legal framework under which unions operate. This frustration was illustrated by American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (“AFL-CIO”) President Lane Kirkland 2 ̆ 7 s statement in the early 1980 s suggesting that the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) be repealed, thereby allowing unions and employers to operate within the “law of the jungle. ” Perhaps owing to sustained union membership losses, unions have recently fought hard for legislation that will facilitate the organizing process...|$|R

One prevailing {{view is that the}} term 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 is not ambiguous, has a temporal aspect meaning 2 ̆ 2 abrupt, 2 ̆ 2 and thus the potential application of the exception is limited. Another prevailing view is that the term 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 is ambiguous because it has more than one meaning and therefore under insurance law doctrines requires the issue be resolved in favor of the plaintiff insured. A third still developing view has asked the courts to not rely on {{the definition of}} 2 ̆ 2 sudden 2 ̆ 2 but to determine the issue through regulatory estoppel. The New York Court of Appeals in Northville Industries v.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{quantitative}} and qualitative content analysis designed {{to determine how the}} Pittsburgh Courier reported the issue of African-American military participation and integration of the U. S. Armed Forces prior to World War II and how that news coverage changed over time. The researcher analyzed 368 news items from 312 weekly editions of the Courier published between September 1, 1934, and September 21, 1940. The researcher compared news content across two periods within the time range specified for the study. The researcher found that the Courier consistently and extensively reported on the issue during the time period. The Courier portrayed the issue of racial discrimination in the military and the argument for integration differently at different periods. An analysis of the major themes showed that racial discrimination as an argument for integration was the dominant theme throughout both periods as compared to the argument of civil rights or African-American military capability, heroism, and patriotism. There {{was no significant difference between}} sources by race in articles that discussed the issue. Both African-American and Caucasian sources were attributed equally throughout both time periods.

30|$|Science policy rarely {{proceeds}} in {{an orderly}} fashion. This is because policy construction, development, revision, public input, implementation and evaluation form a complex system undertaken {{over long periods of}} time, by multiple actors located in multiple sites who are influenced by contextual, economic and other political factors. Science policy is complex for another reason, in that it is often responsive to unplanned events. Despite these factors there are some hopeful signs for deploying science policy more effectively. Japan’s recent experience in response to its devastating tsunami showed that public trust is a necessary activity for countries seeking to implement science policy-making[47]. This view is consistent with calls to democratize science which will require sustained critical reflection and creative political experimentation[48] in setting up inclusive governance initiative for innovation across a variety of scientific domains. Democratization, however, faces two major challenges. On the one hand, more inclusive governance processes may end up including non-reconcilable visions and values. The Stamina case, for example, raises a number of doubts about how {{we may be able to}} reduce the gap between radically diverging framings of regenerative medicine. The second challenge arises from the global environment in which scientific innovation <b>is</b> <b>occurring</b> especially <b>regarding</b> coordinated governance initiatives across a complex environment of cultural, political and social variation.|$|R

Reinhold's emphasis on history is evident in his declaration that philosophies and religions are to be judged on the way that they respond to the needs of reason in a particular era.

30|$|Three self-optimization schemes are {{proposed}} in [12, 13]. Generally, all self-optimization schemes aim {{to minimize the}} number of mobility events based on their measurement. Consequently, the FAPs {{must be able to}} collect statistical information regarding the mobility events. The first scheme forces the adaptation of FAPs power only according to the mobility events generated by passing users. The advantage is that the number of outdoor mobility events is significantly minimized. Nevertheless, the number of indoor mobility events may be high. This disadvantage is eliminated by the second proposed self-optimization scheme when the FAPs tries to minimize all mobility events. The last scheme exhaustively searches over all possible power settings and the power of FAPs, during which the smallest number of mobility events <b>occurred,</b> <b>is</b> <b>regarded</b> as the optimum. However, as this approach is not really practical, it serves only as a benchmark. The numerical results demonstrate that self-optimization schemes noticeably outperform all autoconfiguration methods. As already stated, the main disadvantage of all self-optimization schemes proposed in [12, 13] is that UEs inside the house are not always able to attach to the FAPs as the full house coverage is not ensured.|$|R

40|$|Series: Studies in mechanobiology, tissue {{engineering}} and biomaterials, ISSN 1868 - 2006, vol. 21 The orthopedic field has been facing challenging difficulties {{when it comes}} to regeneration of large and/or complex defects as we come across in osteochondral (OC) cases of lesions grade 4. Autologous OC mosaicplasty {{has proven to be a}} valid therapeutic option but donor site morbidity and the lack of long-term functionality remain sources of concern. OC {{tissue engineering}} has shown an increasing development to provide suitable strategies for the regeneration of damaged cartilage and underlying subchondral bone tissue. The use of two scaffolds with optimized properties for bone and cartilage architectures combined at the time of implantation as a multilayered structure was one of the first approaches for OC large defects regeneration. Last decade strategies using a bony-like scaffold supporting a cell layer for cartilage phase were introduced. Beyond the approaches already mentioned, three other strategies were reported for OCD regeneration. One methodology was the use of two different layers with a compact interface to create an integrated bilayered scaffold before cell seeding. A second strategy was the use of a single continuous structure but with different features in each layer. The last one was the combination of hydrogel phases creating this way the possibility to have injectable systems. These promising strategies for the regeneration of complex OCDs comprise the use of different biomaterials, growth factors, and cells alone or in combination, but the ideal solution is still to be found. The interface’s mechanical properties have to be optimized. A different problem is related with the cell culture method within the 3 D bilayered structures with heterogeneous properties. With the increasing demand of these stratified 3 D structures new cell culture systems are required. Moreover these structures present the potential to be used as in vitro models, which is a need also because of the pressure resulting from the 3 R’s principle implementation that <b>is</b> now <b>occurring.</b> <b>Regarding</b> this, adapted bioreactors are being developed, but more efforts are required to target this scientific demand.

40|$|After Israel’s triumphant {{victory over}} its Arab {{neighbors in the}} 1967 Six-Day War, the State {{immediately}} began a policy of territorial seizure in the newly occupied areas. Tracing these seizure practices, their supporting spatial apparatuses and the legalistic manipulations which have enabled de facto annexation to occur, this thesis uncovers not only the involvement of military officials and political figures, but also shows the complex utilization of nature and landscape for geopolitical means. From Jewish-only settlements to closed military areas, nature reserves, unilaterally-seized areas of ‘State Land’ and the cantons of split Israeli-PA jurisdiction, the creeping practices of Israeli annexation in this conflict <b>are</b> <b>occurring</b> without <b>regard</b> for international law or for the purportedly crucial negotiation process. Traditional assessments of the current status quo correctly identify the catastrophic effects of the continued Israeli occupation on the economic, social and environmental systems of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Yet they fall short of realizing the unique potentialities for Palestinian resistance and subversion inherent within this same state of imbalance. This thesis therefore seeks to elucidate three {{ways in which the}} Palestinians can capitalize on unexploited opportunities within the current destabilized conditions of Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. It will argue that the agency of architecture provides a crucial means of political intervention in a protracted dispute where the traditional political figures are unable to affect change via the processes of the peace negotiations. Beyond spatial tactics of resistance, the designs herein propounded have been conceived to thrive in a political environment which is shifting, volatile and indeterminate. Harnessing instability, they suggest new means of social, economic and environmental improvement for the Palestinians while simultaneously addressing their desires to establish an independent state. Cumulatively, these design proposals argue against the futile despair felt by many Palestinians that self-determination will only come by means of the perpetually stalled negotiations process. Instead, they outline new avenues for redirecting the trajectory of this conflict on the ground, through the strategic choreographing of Palestinian actions within, and taking advantage of, the very landscape in which they inhabit...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{developing}} nations have pushed for international copyright and other intellectual property regimes to expand protection over the cultural heritage and collective knowledge of particular indigenous groups. These “traditional knowledge” protections have been justified by factors like economic protection, equity in intellectual property ownership, cultural protection, and economic development. These motivating factors are {{a far cry}} from the underpinnings of traditional Western intellectual property law—and in particular, U. S. copyright law—which focuses on incentivizing the creation of new content for the promotion of “the Progress of Science and useful Arts. ” Because of these differing justifications, traditional knowledge protections at the international level have generated some degree of friction between the developed and the developing world. So far, much of the debate focuses on the “political” and “real” costs and benefits of traditional knowledge rights, but there is little discussion of the legal consequences of current protections. Given the underlying ideological conflict, some legal dissension <b>is</b> likely to <b>occur</b> <b>regarding</b> enforcement and protection of traditional knowledge rights. This paper examines “positive” traditional knowledge protections, which provide copyright-like rights over content, including the right exclude, license, and profit from these works. In many cases these protections regulate works that Western eyes would view as in the public domain. Initiatives to provide international protection for traditional knowledge expressions have blithely proceeded without much regard for the potential consequences under existing international law. This paper makes the point that at least some existing traditional knowledge protections not only conflict with IP-policy norms of the United States and the European Community, but also that these protections violate the very terms of TRIPS and GATT. As work toward international protection of traditional knowledge progresses, policy makers should be aware of these legal incompatibilities and how they evidence the deep conflict between expansive traditional knowledge protections and Western IP policy...|$|R
