5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Brock {{explained}} their {{method of}} working as [...] "we recorded bass, guitar, drums and vocals together, so it's as live {{as it can}} be, and then we put on the other things afterwards... We just let the tapes run and play like <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we're playing live; do a three-hour track and then cut it up into pieces, use one piece as a complete section, and join it up to another piece with a synthesiser link or something... It's improvised, but it's together in the first place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> {{we go to}} heaven," [...] I suggested; {{the banker}} did not answer, and I {{instantly}} felt that {{in the presence of}} the minister my remark was out of taste.|$|E
5000|$|Que Mal Fizemos Nós (What wrong have <b>we</b> <b>done)</b> (<b>When</b> I Kissed The Teacher) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{get out of}} {{this hole}} and then throw fire brands into the cave---like <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were after the wildcats," [...] {{suggested}} Giant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You silly boys {{think we}} must pair off as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> children; but <b>we</b> shall <b>do</b> {{nothing of the}} kind. How well Parnassus looks from here!' said Nan, {{abruptly}} changing the conversation again.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is false}}--at least, it is false that I took the money. I might have dreamed {{about it and}} talked in my sleep. We are not {{accountable}} for what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we are sleeping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Mark," [...] said Lord Lufton, [...] "excuse me if I {{say that}} that's nonsense. What do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> {{a poor man}} has come to think that another man's {{property}} is his own? We send him to prison for making the mistake." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{small boat}} was soon out of sight, and Walter turned away {{to seek the}} shade, for it was growing hotter and hotter. [...] "If this is a sample of weather in the torrid zone, what shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we get into Cuban waters?" [...] he observed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuredly not," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "that is self-evident, {{but as you}} say, I am afraid he did know his poor sister's {{character}} better than <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> he came to warn me against the marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dan, you are mining boss, and I {{make you}} both quarter owners in 'The Witch' with all I have, and share and share alike, as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> hadn't a dime. Now hurrah for 'The Witch.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that; for on {{the popular}} notion of our being punished a million years hence for what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were lads, I never could see {{anything}} but a misery and injustice in our having come into the world at all." ...|$|R
60|$|One sacrament are consecrate, {{the earth}} Not we alone hath passions hymeneal, The yellow {{buttercups}} that shake for mirth At daybreak know a pleasure not less real Than <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> in some fresh-blossoming wood, We draw the spring into our hearts, {{and feel that}} life is good.|$|E
60|$|ERNEST (becoming confidential, as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I {{should be}} asked {{to say a few}} words to the servants, I have strung {{together}} a little speech. (His hand strays to his pocket.) I was wondering where I should stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll say {{a row of}} bricks," [...] March assented, [...] "I'll {{agree with}} you. It's {{certainly}} Anglo-Saxon to fall over one another as <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> we get going. It {{would be interesting to}} know just how much liking there is in the popularity of a given book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But I wouldn't {{want him}} to show our lads any special favors," [...] broke in Tom, quickly. [...] "If the boys went there, I should want them to {{stand on their own}} feet, just as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> went to Putnam Hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you needn't furnish {{it all at}} once," [...] Mrs. Grimstone suggested. [...] "Just {{a kitchen}} and two {{bedrooms}} for a start, and you can put things into the parlor afterwards. That's the way <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first married. But you must have some furniture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think what}} they are doing," [...] the rajah, who was now {{standing}} on the wall, close to the gate, said to Harry. [...] "However numerous they may be, they should have moved as noiselessly as <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> went out to attack them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{have your}} bag," [...] I said, as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we meet {{people at the}} train, and he {{instantly}} bestowed a rather heavy valise upon me, with a smile in his benignant eyes, {{as if it had}} been the greatest favor. [...] "Have you got any checks?" [...] I asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{does not}} know it is so," [...] said Margaret; [...] "I am his first care, I fear, his second grief; {{but it is not}} in the nature of things that Ethel should not be more his comfort and companion. Oh! I am glad it was not she who married! What shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> she goes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I hate him. Everybody hates him; {{he is such}} a proud brute, {{but what}} can <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> <b>when</b> the king commands, all must obey. If I was as big and stout as you are," [...] added the man with a steady gaze at the prince, [...] "I'd go at this fellow and win the fair princess myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We look finer birds than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> rode in with brother Philip," [...] Beorn {{laughed when}} they had attired {{themselves}} in their new garments. [...] "The more sober of these suits are a good deal gayer than those we wore at home even at court ceremonies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{look quite}} at home here, Mr. Bathurst, don't we?" [...] Mrs. Doolan said cheerfully, {{as he passed}} her; [...] "and I think we all feel {{a great deal more}} {{comfortable}} than <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> you gave us your warning last night; the anticipation is always worse than the reality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Elmore, [...] "rich or not rich, {{it seems}} to make very little odds; <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not seem to have}} half as much money to spare as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> lived in the little house in Spring Street. What with new {{furnishing}} the house, and getting every thing you boys and girls say you must have, we are poorer, if any thing, than we were then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{we catch}} {{any of the}} Pongo," [...] went on Bausi, [...] "as {{sometimes}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> they come to hunt for slaves, we kill them. Ever since the Mazitu {{have been in this}} place there has been hate and war between them and the Pongo, and if I could wipe out those evil ones, then I should die happily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had an uncommonly {{good time}} that day, and haven't {{got over it}} yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything. It's you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we can't eat anymore?" [...] asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'll tell 'ee what, dames," [...] {{continued}} he; [...] "if so be that {{we cannot}} enjoy the dinner that madam gives us because Mother Lookaloft is sitting up there on a grand sofa, I think we ought all to go home. If we greet at that, what'll <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> true sorrow comes across us? How would you be now, Dame, if the boy there had broke his neck {{when he got the}} tumble?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Stalky. [...] "He can't do much. 'Tisn't as if you'd {{pulled the}} desks up like <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> old Carleton took prep. once. Keep it up! Hear 'em cheering in the studies!" [...] He rocketed {{out with a}} yell, to find Flint and the prefects lifting the roof off the corridor.|$|R
30|$|It is {{significant}} that to obtain molybdenum nanowalls, the substrates should be placed below the Mo boat with a certain distance away, instead of being directly placed inside the boat, as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> growing Mo nanowires[14]. In the present study, the growth orientation and {{the driving force of}} nucleation can be controlled by adjusting the spacing between the Mo boat and substrates.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we had a}} {{very good}} time visiting it," [...] said Rollo. [...] "We went over the bridge where you and I stopped to look down to the market, and came to High Street. But instead of turning down, as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were going to Holyrood, we turned up; because, you know, the castle is {{on the top of the}} hill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what shall}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we get there?" [...] cried Lady Beach-Mandarin. [...] "I feel {{we ought to}} do {{something}} more than call. Can't we carry her off right away, Mr. Brumley? I want to go right in to her and say 'Look here! I'm on your side. Your husband's a tyrant. I'm help and rescue. I'm all that a woman ought to be--fine and large. Come out from under that unworthy man's heel!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I went to work,--started {{sweeping}} out a store, I mean. See here, mother, you've sacrificed {{enough for}} me already. After paying father's debts, we've come out here {{with only a few}} thousand dollars, and the nine hundred I saved out of this year's Law School allowance. What shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> that is gone? The honorable legal profession, as my friend reminded me to-night, is not the swiftest road to millions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have the}} sun," [...] {{one of the}} Arabs answered; [...] "but even without that we could find our way, and do so even on the darkest night. The horses know the way as well as <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> they have once journeyed over a track they never forget it, and even did they swerve a little it would not matter, for they can smell water miles away, and would always, if unguided, make for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mirabel gravely {{registered}} the proposal, {{as far as}} it went. [...] "What are <b>we</b> to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get to the keeper's lodge?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps we {{had better}} tell Miss Strange what <b>we</b> have <b>done.</b> <b>When</b> they have brought us our coffee we'll find a quiet place where we can talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fountain, dreamily: [...] "Nothing. Merely {{wondering}} what <b>we</b> shall <b>do</b> <b>when</b> we've {{got rid of}} our superstitions. Shall we be the better for it, or even the wiser?" ...|$|R
