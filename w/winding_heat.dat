50|$|Road Fighter (Rōdo Faitā) is {{a racing}} arcade game {{developed}} by Konami and released in December 1984. It {{also was the}} first racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and <b>Winding</b> <b>Heat</b> in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only rebooted sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after <b>Winding</b> <b>Heat.</b>|$|E

Comparing to oil transformer, the {{dry-type transformer}} minimizes explosion and fire hazard, {{as well as}} long product life. Meanwhile winding insulation {{plays an important role}} in the reliability, yet winding temperature rise may cause deterioration to the insulation. So it is critical to have temperature rise analysis for hot spot and prediction in the period of prototype design using finite element method, such as CFD. The key factors like completed boundary condition and coupling of electro-magnetic with thermal fluid will be obtained from experiment which could provide more accurate heat transfer coefficient for new design. Relative to method of thermal-network, CFD has provided more accurate air convection model and different boundary condition definition, thus it could be an original data for other serial product simulation...|$|E

In this research, {{the difference of}} two heating methods (far-infrared ray <b>heating</b> and hot <b>wind</b> <b>heating)</b> was analyzed. To compare their differences, the heat flux was measured by setting a heat flux meter {{beneath the surface of}} the object at different depths, then the heat conductivities and heat diffusion rates were analyzed. 1.

The heat conductivity and heat diffusion rate of far-infrared heating are higher than those of hot <b>wind</b> <b>heating.</b> The differences are considered to be caused by far-infrared rays. 農産物の乾燥は、産物の変質防止、貯蔵性や加工性の向上を目的として行われる。また、農産物は形状や物性が異なっており、独性な風味をもっているものが多く、その品質を重視する乾燥方法が取られなければならず、乾燥する上で種々の制約があり、それぞれの農産物に対して乾燥方法が研究されて乾燥機は独自の構造をもったものが発達している。農産物を対象にする従来からの乾燥システムは熱の利用上から分ければ、熱風乾燥、補助熱源付加通風乾燥および常温通風乾燥などのタイプが考えられる。熱を利用する乾燥は加熱された空気の中に被乾燥物を置き、対流熱伝達によって加熱し乾燥させるもので、通称は熱風乾燥という。その目的は乾燥時間を短縮させ、乾燥能率を向上することであり、もっとも一般的な乾燥方法である。従来の加熱乾燥は、被乾燥物の表面を加熱し、表面から内部への熱伝達は、被乾燥物自身の熱伝導により物体の表面から内部に熱が伝えられ、加熱されて水分を蒸発させるものである。しかし、多数の農産物は熱伝導率が小さいので、内部温度を上昇させるには、表面の温度を高くして表面と内部との温度こう配を大きくしなければならない。そのためには熱風の温度を高くし、加熱時間を長くする必要がある。温度こう配が大きいほど加熱速度は大きくなるが、乾燥過程において焦げる。煮えるなど品質に悪影響も生ずる。ここで、遠赤外線加熱の特徴を利用した農産物の高能率乾燥技術を確立するために、蒸したサツマイモを供試して加熱するとき、熱伝達の様子を熱流束および熱拡散率（温度伝達率）を用いて、熱風による加熱と比較しながら表面から近い部分の熱伝達について検討した...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this work}} is to address the design of next-generation, high torque density electrical machines through numerical optimization using an integrated thermal-electromagnetic design tool that accounts for advanced cooling technology. A parametric thermal model of electric machines was constructed and implemented using a finite difference approach incorporating an automated, self segmenting mesh generation. A novel advanced cooling technology is proposed to improve thermal transport in the machine by removing heat directly from the windings via heat exchangers located between the winding bundles. Direct <b>winding</b> <b>heat</b> exchange (DWHX) requires high convective transport and low pressure loss. The heat transfer to pressure drop tradeoff was addressed by developing empirically derived Nusselt number and friction factor correlations for micro-hydrofoil enhanced meso-channels. The parametric thermal model, advanced cooling technique, Nusselt number and friction factor correlations were combined with a parametric electromagnetic model for electric machines. The integrated thermal-electromagnetic model was then {{used in conjunction with}} particle swarm optimization to determine optimal conceptual designs. The Nusselt number correlation achieves an R² value of 0. 99 with 95 % of the data falling within ± 2. 5 % similarly the friction factor correlation achieves an R² value of 0. 92 with 95 % of the data falling within ± 10. 2 %. The integrated thermal-electromagnetic design tool, incorporating DWHX, generated an optimized 20 kW permanent magnet electric machine design achieving a torque density of 23. 2 N-m/L based on total system volume.

40|$|One {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} <b>heating</b> the solar <b>wind,</b> from {{close to the}} sun to beyond ∼ 10 AU, invokes lowfrequency, oblique, Alfvén-wave turbulence. Because small-scale oblique Alfvén waves (kinetic Alfvén waves) are compressive, the measured density fluctuations in the solar wind place an upper limit on the amplitude of kinetic Alfvén waves and hence an upper limit on {{the rate at which}} the solar <b>wind</b> can be <b>heated</b> by lowfrequency, Alfvénic turbulence. We evaluate this upper limit for both coronal holes at 5 R ⊙ and in the near-Earth solar wind. At both radii, the upper limit we find is consistent with models in which the solar <b>wind</b> is <b>heated</b> by low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence. At 1 AU, the upper limit on the turbulent heating rate derived from the measured density fluctuations is within a factor of 2 of the measured solar <b>wind</b> <b>heating</b> rate. Thus if low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence contributes to heating the near-Earth solar wind, kinetic Alfvén waves must be one of the dominant sources of solar wind density fluctuations at frequencies ∼ 1 Hz. We also present a simple argument for why density fluctuation measurements do appear to rule out models in which the solar <b>wind</b> is <b>heated</b> by non-turbulent high frequency waves “sweeping ” through the ion-cyclotron resonance, but are compatible with heating by low-frequency Alfvénic turbulence.
