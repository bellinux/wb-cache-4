2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Boucher and McComas felt [...] "the {{stories of the}} Viagens Interplanetarias have usually struck us as pretty routine work unworthy of L. Sprague de Camp, but devotees of the series will welcome the {{collected}} volume." [...] Groff Conklin assessed it as a [...] "cream-puff-light book of space opera ... ine stuff for bedtime, but I do feel that the stories were written with the left hind paw of an immensely brilliant fellow who just wasn't trying hard. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it 'relentlessly light reading!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was at once}} {{evident to}} Rivers that [...] "the names applied to {{the various forms of}} blood {{relationship}} did not correspond to those used by Europeans, but belonged to what is known as a 'classificatory system'; a man's 'brothers' or 'sisters' might include individuals <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> cousins and the key to this nomenclature {{is to be found in}} forms of social organisation especially in varieties of the institution of marriage." [...] Rivers found that relationship terms were used to imply definite duties, privileges and mutual restrictions in conduct, rather than being biologically based as ours are. As Head puts it: [...] "all these facts were clearly demonstrable by the genealogical method, a triumphant generalisation which has revolutionised ethnology." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{early use}} of the land {{surrounding}} Grub Street was archery. [...] In Records of St. Giles' Cripplegate (1883), the author describes an order made by Henry VII to convert Finsbury Fields from gardens, to fields for archery practice, however in Elizabethan times archery became unfashionable, and Grub Street is described as largely deserted, [...] "except for low gambling houses and bowling-alleysor, as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> them, skittle-grounds." [...] John Stow also referred to Grubstreete in A Survey of London Volume II (1603) as [...] "It was convenient for bowyers, since it lay near the Archery-butts in Finsbury Fields", and in 1651 the poet Thomas Randoph wrote [...] "Her eyes are Cupid's Grub-Street: the blind archer, Makes his love-arrows there." [...] The little London directory of 1677 lists six merchants living in 'Grubſreet', and Costermongers also plied their trade—a Mr Horton, who died in September 1773, earned a fortune of £2,000 by hiring wheelbarrows out. [...] Land was cheap and occupied mostly by the poor, and the area was renowned {{for the presence of}} Ague and the Black Death; in the 1660s the Great Plague of London killed nearly eight thousand of the parish's inhabitants.|$|E

5000|$|Williams {{has been}} very vocal about social issues like feminism. She once commented to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I feel like <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stop <b>calling</b> feminists 'feminists' and just start calling people who aren't feminist 'sexist' - and then {{everyone}} else is just human." ...|$|R

60|$|I had {{borrowed}} {{the book from}} the Library, to which I have been a subscriber in secret for some time past. It was an old volume, full of what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> now <b>call</b> Gossip; relating strange adventures, and scandalous incidents in family history which had been concealed from public notice.|$|R
60|$|After {{consulting}} my watch, I satisfied {{myself that}} I {{could go to}} the mill, and get back again, before the hour fixed for our late dinner--supper <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> it in Germany. For the second time that day, and without any hesitation, I took the road that led to Fordwitch Wood.|$|R
5000|$|Spencer (1989 at 59) {{describes}} the offence as, [...] "...a rag-bag of {{odds and ends}} which <b>we</b> <b>should</b> nowadays <b>call</b> 'public welfare offences'".

6000|$|... "Faith, {{this has}} been a whole town in its day! <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it a city in America, and furnish it with a mayor, aldermen, and recorder--you might stow old Faneuil Hall in one of its lockers." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gundry {{disputes}} this title: [...] "The sayings {{are traditionally}} called 'the Antitheses'. But this designation seems {{to imply that}} after stoutly affirming the Law in , Jesus contradicts it". Instead Gundry argues that Jesus escalates the Law towards [...] "the goal toward which it was already headed, so that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stop <b>calling</b> these sayings [...] "the Antitheses" [...] and perhaps start calling them [...] "the Culminations".|$|R

Nor can I imagine, but {{had they}} been taken, they, as creatures excelling in strength, {{would have been more}} capable of {{rendering}} these praises and blessings to God for eternal mercies, than such poor sorry creatures as we are, could. But! [...] "behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>called</b> the children of God" [...] (1 John 3:1).

60|$|Neither {{of us knew}} {{much about}} sailing a full-rigged ship; but that didn't worry me a great deal, for I was {{confident}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never be <b>called</b> upon to do so, and as the day of launching approached I was positive of it.|$|R

6000|$|... "And what {{if their}} God were present?" [...] {{said one of}} the heathen members of the company, next day. [...] "Why did they all look so blank? A most {{favorable}} omen, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it, to have one's patron divinity at a feast." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the miracles}} of Moses, {{there is a}} {{remarkable}} intermingling of acts, which <b>we</b> <b>should</b> now-a-days <b>call</b> simply providential, with such as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> still <b>call</b> miraculous. The passing of the Jordan, in the 3d chapter {{of the book of}} Joshua, is perhaps the purest and sheerest miracle recorded in the Bible; it seems to have been wrought for the miracle's sake, and so thereby to show to the Jews--the descendants of those who had come out of Egypt-- that the same God who had appeared to their fathers, and who had by miracles, in many respects providential only, preserved them in the wilderness, was their God also. The manna and quails were ordinary provisions of Providence, rendered miraculous by certain laws and qualities annexed to them in the particular instance. The passage of the Red Sea was effected by a strong wind, which, we are told, drove hack the waters; and so on. But then, again, the death of the first-born was purely miraculous. Hence, then, both Jews and Egyptians might take occasion to learn, that it was one and the same God who interfered specially, and who governed all generally.|$|R

6000|$|In August Philip was killed, the English believing {{themselves}} to [...] "have prayed the bullet straight into his heart;" [...] {{and his head}} was carried about on a pole, in a manner <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> worthy of the Indians themselves, did we not recollect {{that there were a}} good many city gates at home with much the same kind of trophy, while his wife and children--miserable fate!--were, like many others of the captives, sold into slavery to the sugar planters in Jamaica.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is no time}} to {{be talking}} over {{bearings}} and distances," [...] observed the officer next in rank to Griffith; [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> the hands up, and try to kedge her off while the sea will suffer a boat to live." ...|$|E

It is given to us for us to protect and encourage--I may say, to revere.

It is, like all God's messages, all God's laws, ay, like God's {{world in which we}} live and breathe, at once beautiful and awful; full of life-giving hope; but full, too, of chastening fear. Hope for the glorious future which it opens to poor human beings like us; fear, lest so great a promise being left us, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> fall short of it by our own fault.
