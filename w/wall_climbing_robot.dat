40|$|In recent decades, skyscrapers, as {{represented}} by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and Shanghai Tower in Shanghai, have been built due to the improvements of construction technologies. Even in such newfangled skyscrapers, the façades are generally cleaned by humans. <b>Wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots,</b> which are capable of climbing up vertical surfaces, ceilings and roofs, are expected to replace the manual workforce in façade cleaning works, which is both hazardous and laborious work.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> is relatively recent, beginning with some large scale robots {{in the early}} 1990 s. <b>Wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> {{can be used to}} gain access to or inspect space that is not easily accessible or dangerous for human operators. The range of applicable fields encompasses industrial processes and inspection, exploration, rescue and monitoring. The smaller robots can be used for surveillance purposes due to their stealthy nature. Larger crawling robots may be used to carry out specific tasks such as sand blasting of ship hulls and blasting and spray painting of large containers such as cylindrical storage tanks used by the chemical, petroleum and nuclear industries. Their flexibility and mobility mean that they can accomplish tasks that would be impossible for more conventional robots. The flexibility of mobility that such robots gain from their ability to move on all surfaces rather than only horizontal ones creates some unique challenges. Broadly, they can be split into three categories: robot design, robot control and motion planning, and environmental mapping and localisation. This thesis examines the first two of these problems. A prototype bipedal robot has been built and a second designed in order to capitalise on the experience gained with the first. An in-depth examination of the motion planning problem has been made and new techniques to tackle this problem have been developed. Such techniques are not limited to applications with <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> as there is commonality with more traditional fixed manipulators. Finally, the planning techniques were combined with the robot design in a test scenario that validated both the design and the motion planning techniques developed throughout the dissertation...|$|R

In design the robot use pneumatic system as main unit to move on the wall. The robot can move in four directions, forward, backward, left and right.

40|$|Abstract]: This {{project is}} to build a <b>wall</b> <b>{{climbing}}</b> <b>robot.</b> This robot is a suction type of wall climbing robot; using PIC to do the interfacing, control the movement of the robot, ventilation fan and the sensors. The position sensors are used to sense any things blocking its path while it is climbing up, therefore it can be rotated left, right, up and down. The on-board pump has been replaced by computer fan which will lower the cost as well as the weight of the original product. The cost of building this robot must be cheaper than the commercial robots. BACKGROUND In all suction adhesion robot that are used for <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robot,</b> they used onboard pump that created a pressure drop inside the vacuum cups that are pressed against the wall or ceiling. As the vacuum cup are pressed against the wall, the on board pump will start to pump the air in the vacuum cup out to the surrounding. After some time, the pressure inside the vacuum cup is lower than that outside the vacuum cup thus it is able to “stick” onto the wall. This type of <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robot</b> requires a smooth and flat vertical surface, therefore if there is a crack in the wall or the vertical surface is uneven, it will not work. Another problem of this type of robot is that it is much slower than other types of <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robot,</b> as it needs time to build up the required pressure to hold itself on to the wall. The suction adhesion robots are normally used on valley bridges and the temperature could be around 0 to 50 degree Celsius. As for the weight, this type of robot should not be more than 35 kg, thus the body of this robot should be make of non metallic material. The centre of gravity of the robot must be kept as close as to the vertical surface as possible, as the force required to hold the whole weight of the robot will be reduced. Although this kind of robot is normally used to do the cleaning for high buildings and under high way bridges, this will in turn replace human beings thus reducing the accident rate. This will further increase the human being rate of living...|$|E

30|$|The “Planar Walker” (Fig.  2 a) uses a {{suction force}} {{to stick to}} a wall. Many other <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> also employ this method [8 – 10].

However, this mechanism has several drawbacks for our application. Robots that employ this mechanism require a continuous energy supply to maintain the robot’s adhered status. Moreover, estimation of a robot’s position is not easy; without additional sensors, this estimation includes errors, and these errors accumulate according to increments in moving distance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Finding {{traversable}} paths using {{computer vision}} {{is one of}} the most important components of an intelligent mobile robot system. For a <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robot</b> that operates in an urban environment, it is essential to automatically detect surface types and orientations for switching between moving and climbing, and for applying different adhesive forces both to save energy and ensure its own safety.

The new approach takes advantage of the fact that many man-made objects in an urban setting consist of planar surfaces.

40|$|In this chapter, the {{detailed}} {{design of a}} novel adhesion mechanism is described for <b>robots</b> <b>climbing</b> on concrete structures. The aim is to deliver a low-power and sustainable adhesion technique for <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> {{to gain access to}} test sites on large concrete structures which may be located in hazardous industrial environments. A small, mobile prototype robot with on-board force sensor was built which exhibited 3600 of manoeuvrability on a 50 × 50 mm meshed rein-forcement bars test rig with maximum adhesion force of 108 N at 35 mm air gap. The proposed adhesion module consists of three N 42 grade neodymium magnets arranged in a unique arrangement on a flux concentrator. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to study the effect of design parameters such as the distance be-tween the magnets, thickness and material of the flux concentrator, use of two concentrators, etc. Using two modules with minimum distance between them showed an increase of 82 N in adhesion force compared to a single module system with higher force-to-weight ratio of 4. 36.

40|$|Abstract — {{this paper}} {{describes}} a pair of <b>wall</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>robots</b> that use magnetic wheels for adhesion. They are designed for inspecting the interior surfaces of gas-tanks in oversea ships. Environments like this were impossible to access by previous <b>climbing</b> <b>robots,</b> as they are made out of very thin sheet metal that cannot support a high robot mass and contain several types of difficult obstacles. In order to master these challenges, the system described in this work uses two robots in a “mother-child”-structure: The smaller robot is built very lightweight and simple, without the ability to steer or climb vertically. It just moves horizontally and uses ridges in the gas tank surface as guidance rails. In order to pass from one ridge to the next one, the smaller robot docks to the bigger “mother”-robot. This robot always stays {{in an area where}} the sheet metal is thicker and never enters the extremely fragile surfaces. Thus, its mass is not critical for the structural stability of the environment and the robot can hence be built big {{enough to be able to}} climb in all directions of gravity and to pass difficult obstacles along its path. In the present paper, the basic concept, the mechanical design of all important components and the proposed control strategy are described briefly, followed by test results of the most critical components. An outlook to similar applications to which the basic idea of this work can be successfully transferred concludes this article...|$|R
