This is a signature move of Jordan's. At 0:09, a player drives to the basket <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> hanging out. He recreates a moment from the 1991 NBA Finals, game 2: Jordan scored a layup after switching hands in midair to avoid Sam Perkins of the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario World is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). An instalment in the Super Mario series, it was first released in Japan on 21 November 1990, in North America on 13 August 1991 and in Europe on 11 April 1992. The story follows Mario's quest to save Princess Toadstool and Dinosaur Land from series antagonist Bowser and his children, the Koopalings. Gameplay is similar to previous entries in the series, with players controlling Mario or his brother Luigi {{through a series of}} levels to stop Bowser. The game also introduces Yoshi, a dinosaur who can eat enemies <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue.</b> This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E

500|$|In 1888, Getzein {{compiled}} an 18–22record and a 3.05ERA. [...] He started 46games {{and completed}} 45 {{of them with}} 404innings pitched. However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as Pete Conway compiled a 30–14record and a 2.25ERA for the 1888 Wolverines. [...] After Getzein gave up 10runs in an August1888 game against Washington, the Detroit Free Press dubbed him the [...] "Pulverized Pretzel." [...] The newspaper reported: [...] "The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat. [...] When he pitched high they hit it. [...] When he delivered his famous drop, he was knocked out of the lot, and his in and out curves were as big as balloons to Ted Sullivan's men." [...] As the 1888season progressed, relations between Getzein and the Detroit manager became strained. [...] After {{a game in which}} Getzein gave up 21hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: [...] "The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary. [...] The Bostons have no license to make 21 hits off the Pretzel when he pitches his game. [...] Either he was not in condition to pitch or he didn't try to[...] [...] [...] If the latter, and he repeated his performance against the Kansas Citys a few years ago, when he deliberately tossed the balls to the plate and permitted the Cowboys to make 13 runs in one inning, why no one here would mourn much if he was fined to the limit. [...] What the merits of his quarrel with Watkins are of course are not known here. [...] But Getzein is inclined to be very free <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue.</b> [...] Considering his fine treatment here it is time for him to get over his childish humors and do the best he knows how whenever called on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orange {{has several}} {{recurring}} mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly yelling [...] "Hey, (name of character)!" [...] until the character responds. Orange also often {{refers to the}} character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit [...] "Apefruit"). If he does not like an object, he will often say [...] "You're an apple!", even if the object is not (e.g., a tomato). Orange uses various tactics, such as telling rude and offensive jokes, burping and making childish noises <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> to get attention.|$|E

2500|$|Archer {{was three}} years old when de Mestre began his {{training}} at Terara (near Nowra) in May 1860. Nicknamed [...] "The Bull" [...] by locals, Archer was considered large for a three-year-old; he stood 16.3 hands with powerful hindquarters, a deep girth, well-sprung ribs and a good head and neck. His idiosyncrasies included his curious rolling gait when galloping, {{and the fact that he}} galloped <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> lolling out of his mouth. He was a long-striding horse, who could cover [...] in 16 strides. Archer’s large frame told on his legs, and he was frequently lame. Archer was lightly regarded after he ran badly in his first two races at Randwick in late May 1860. However, at the spring meeting later that year and the autumn meeting of 1861 he was undefeated in seven New South Wales races.|$|E

It has been suggested by writer Dorothy Hobson that the character of Pete was a portrayal of a typical East End male, [...] "macho and mouthy". Author Christine Geraghty has suggested that Pete was seemingly intolerant of difference, but that his position was always undermined [...] "by his blustering espousal of an excessively masculine position. Pete's , like much else he does, are not followed through." [...] Discussing the character's other qualities, author Kate Lock has suggested that Pete was [...] "a simple, amiable sort of chap [...] left others {{to get on with the}} complicated things in life." [...] Lock added that complications were beyond Pete's grasp and that he had trouble articulating emotions. Meanwhile, author Rupert Smith has classified Pete as a [...] "soft touch" [...] character. He added that Pete started off as [...] "a cheery chappy" [...] but became [...] "hard to like", using his failure to support his wife Kathy through her rape ordeal in 1988 as a reason why he lost public sympathy.|$|E
