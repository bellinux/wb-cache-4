60|$|It quite {{shocked me}} to hear it, for I had already {{recalled}} with anything but a serious association {{the image of the}} man sitting on the sofa that night <b>wiping</b> his <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|Washing {{the face}} twice and the arms twice. It is not {{permissible}} to <b>wipe</b> the <b>head</b> and the feet twice (unless {{it is because}} one missed a spot) {{and that it is}} not permissible to wash the face and the arms three times.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} him {{up into his}} room, {{and asked him if}} I could do anything for him. He flopped the hamper on the bed with a sigh of relief, took off his hat, <b>wiped</b> his <b>head</b> with his handkerchief, and then turned to answer me.|$|R
60|$|So saying, he sate down, {{pushed back}} his brigadier wig, and <b>wiped</b> his <b>head</b> {{with an air}} of easy importance; totally {{regardless}} of the look of well-bred astonishment by which Lady Staunton endeavoured to make him comprehend that he was assuming too great a liberty.|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: 'That's what I don't know.' He {{continues}} to <b>wipe</b> his <b>head</b> with his handkerchief, and to sputter a little {{from time to}} time. 'All I know is that when I got--phew!--to that dark spot by the Frog Pond, just by--phew!--that little group of--phew!--evergreens, you know--phew!--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why ay, my lady lass, I've seen {{my share}} of bad weather,' said the Captain, tremulously <b>wiping</b> his <b>head,</b> 'and I've had {{my share of}} {{knocking}} about; but--but it ain't of myself as I was a meaning to speak. Our dear boy,' drawing closer to her, 'Wal'r, darling, as was drownded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Ot work," [...] he ses, {{taking off}} his ’elmet and <b>wiping</b> his bald <b>’ead</b> with a large red handkerchief. [...] "I’ve lost all my puff." ...|$|R
60|$|Here Mr Pecksniff, accidentally {{dropping}} the tear in question on a bald part of Mr Chuzzlewit's <b>head,</b> <b>wiped</b> {{the place with}} his pocket-handkerchief, and begged pardon.|$|R
60|$|So Petru dug in his spurs, {{drew his}} sword, {{cut of the}} <b>head,</b> <b>wiped</b> the blood, and put the sword back in the sheath before the horse's hoofs touched the ground again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Suspected? I {{should think}} there was {{somebody}} suspected. Egod!' said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit's arm to <b>wipe</b> his heated <b>head.</b> 'Josiah Bounderby of Coketown {{is not to be}} plundered and nobody suspected. No, thank you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pears {{like there}} must o' been, Trot, or they wouldn't o' named it that name," [...] he replied, pausing to <b>wipe</b> his bald <b>head</b> {{with the red}} {{handkerchief}} while the oars dragged in the water.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Bounderby, {{stopping}} and facing about to confront them all, 'I'll tell you. It's {{not to be}} mentioned everywhere; it's not to be mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (there's a gang of 'em) may be thrown off their guard. So take this in confidence. Now wait a bit.' Mr. Bounderby <b>wiped</b> his <b>head</b> again. 'What should you say to;' here he violently exploded: 'to a Hand being in it?' ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} about him from the first that made me think I knew him, and when {{he took off his}} hat to <b>wipe</b> his <b>head</b> it came to me all of a sudden, he being the exact image of his effigy at Madame Tussaud's, which, by a curious coincidence, I happened to have visited with a friend that very afternoon. The lady was what some people would call good-looking, and others mightn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think so? So do I! Well, then, Tom,"--and here Mark {{was seized}} with a {{tendency}} to St. Vitus's dance, and began overhauling every button on his coat, twitching up his black gloves, till (as undertakers' gloves are generally meant to do) they burst in half-a-dozen places; taking off his hat, <b>wiping</b> his <b>head</b> fiercely, and putting the hat on again behind before; till at last he snatched his arm from Tom's, and gripping him by the shoulder, recommenced-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"There is no {{need for}} thee to give any account of thy stewardship," [...] said he. [...] "I have it all from the child here." [...] And he told me how the young thing had stopped his tall horse at the Ford, by waving of a branch, and crying that the way was barred. [...] "And if one bold, bare babe be enough to guard the Ford in these days, thou hast done well," [...] said he, and puffed and <b>wiped</b> his <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was over}} at last. The aggressor went limping off, and Mr. Purnip, <b>wiping</b> his bald <b>head,</b> {{picked up his}} {{battered}} and dusty hat from the roadway and brushed it on his sleeve. He turned with a start and a blush to meet the delighted gaze of Mr. Billing.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Cuttle, {{in a fit}} of delirium, {{attempted}} to <b>wipe</b> his <b>head</b> with the blackened toast upon his hook: and finding it an uncongenial substance for the purpose, put it into the crown of his glazed hat, put the glazed hat on with some difficulty, essayed to sing a verse of Lovely Peg, broke down at the first word, and retired into the shop, whence he presently came back express, with a face all flushed and besmeared, and the starch completely taken out of his shirt-collar, to say these words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see,' he said, <b>wiping</b> his <b>head,</b> and {{breathing}} with difficulty, 'she hasn't taken much to any companions here; she hasn't taken kindly {{to any particular}} acquaintances and friends, not to mention sweethearts. In consequence, an ill-natured story got about, that Em'ly {{wanted to be a}} lady. Now my opinion is, that it came into circulation principally on account of her sometimes saying, at the school, that if she was a lady she would like to do so-and-so for her uncle--don't you see?--and buy him such-and-such fine things.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{thrill of}} awe which passed through {{passengers}} and crew at this spiritual challenge from the vast and intangible void around them had scarcely subsided when the captain turned to Senor Perkins {{with a look of}} surly interrogation. The Senor brushed his hat further back on his <b>head,</b> <b>wiped</b> his brow, and became thoughtful.|$|R
6000|$|Cap'n Bill coughed. Then {{he tried}} to sneeze, to gain time. Then {{he took out his}} red cotton {{handkerchief}} and <b>wiped</b> his bald <b>head</b> with it, rubbing hard so as to make him think clearer. [...] "Look, Trot; ain't that a brig out there?" [...] he inquired, pointing to a sail far out in the sea.|$|R
6000|$|Two Englishmen, and now our {{carriage}} is full. First Englishman, in the monied interest - flushed, highly respectable - Stock Exchange, perhaps - City, certainly. Faculties {{of second}} Englishman entirely absorbed in hurry. Plunges into the carriage, blind. Calls out of window concerning his luggage, deaf. Suffocates himself under pillows of great-coats, for no reason, {{and in a}} demented manner. Will receive no assurance from any porter whatsoever. Is stout and hot, and <b>wipes</b> his <b>head,</b> and makes himself hotter by breathing so hard. Is totally incredulous respecting assurance of Collected Guard, that 'there's no hurry.' No hurry! And a flight to Paris in eleven hours! ...|$|R
60|$|One side, {{close to}} the door, was {{occupied}} by a lean, withered old man, very shabbily dressed in black, who sat eternally mumbling something between his toothless jaws. Occasionally, to the evident disgust of the genteel ladies, he <b>wiped</b> his bald <b>head</b> and wrinkled forehead with a ragged blue cotton handkerchief, which he kept in the crown of his hat.|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman {{said this}} in a very quick, abrupt way, and {{looked as if he}} were afraid his offer might be refused. He was much heated, with {{climbing}} our long stair no doubt, and as he {{stood in the middle of}} the room, puffing and <b>wiping</b> his bald <b>head</b> with a handkerchief, my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair.|$|R
50|$|When Wahab was killed, {{she walked}} towards his corpse {{and sat at}} his <b>head,</b> <b>wiping</b> the blood from it and saying, “Congratulations for having earned Paradise! I plead to Allah Who blessed you with Paradise to make me join you.” Al Shimr heard her and ordered his slave Rustam to hit her head with a rod or mace, which he did. She died there.|$|R
60|$|Hastening to {{a stately}} date-palm, {{of which there}} {{happened}} to be only one specimen {{in the garden of}} the French residence, the heated seaman pushed off his <b>head,</b> <b>wiped</b> his brow, drank the brandy and water, and threw away the tumbler, after which he sat down on a root, mechanically pulled out his pipe, and was in the act of filling it when Colonel Langley came hurriedly forwards.|$|R
60|$|To these remonstrances, {{the single}} gentleman {{answered}} not a word, {{but when the}} trunk was at last got into the bed-room, sat down upon it and <b>wiped</b> his bald <b>head</b> and face with his handkerchief. He was very warm, and well he might be; for, {{not to mention the}} exertion of getting the trunk up stairs, he was closely muffled in winter garments, though the thermometer had stood all day at eighty-one in the shade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{interrupted}} the captain, <b>wiping</b> his bald <b>head</b> with his pocket-handkerchief angrily, [...] "then the money shall {{go to some}} charity-- some--some ridiculous asylum or hospital for teaching logarithms to the Hottentots of the Cape, or something of that sort. I tell you, madam," [...] he added with increased vehemence, seeing that Mrs Tipps still shook her head, [...] "I tell you that I robbed your husband of five hundred pounds!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop a moment; be careful, my lord,' {{put in the}} horse, 'and be {{sure you}} do what I tell you. Dig your spurs in my body up to the rowel, draw your sword, and keep {{yourself}} ready, for we shall have to leap over both bridge and dragon. When you see that we are right above the dragon cut off his biggest <b>head,</b> <b>wipe</b> the blood off the sword, {{and put it back}} clean in the sheath before we touch earth again.' ...|$|R

5|$|Rick and Lori {{decide to}} do the {{operation}} without the necessary equipment. As they prepare for the operation, Shane arrives with the medical supplies, but without Otis. He claims that Otis sacrificed himself {{in order to save}} Carl. The episode flashes back to show Shane sacrificed Otis by shooting him in the leg and leaving him as bait for the walkers while he escaped with the medicine. The episode ends in the present, with Shane shaving his <b>head,</b> <b>wiping</b> out evidence of a bald spot of torn hair caused by Otis during their brief scuffle.|$|R
60|$|All that {{a tender}} nurse could do, Grace did; {{and the power}} to express her solicitude in action, {{unconscious}} though the sufferer was, brought her mournful satisfaction. She bathed his hot <b>head,</b> <b>wiped</b> his perspiring hands, moistened his lips, cooled his fiery eyelids, sponged his heated skin, and administered whatever she could find in the house that the imagination could conceive as likely to be in any way alleviating. That she might have been the cause, or partially the cause, of all this, interfused misery with her sorrow.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{conducting}} salah, a Muslim has {{to perform}} a ritual ablution. The minor ablution is performed using water (wudu), or sand (tayammum) when water is unavailable or not advisable to use for reasons such as illness.Wudu is performed by Muslims according to the instructions of God given in the Quran: [...] "O you who believe! when you rise up to prayer, wash your faces and your hands {{as far as the}} elbows, and <b>wipe</b> your <b>heads</b> and your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation {{to perform a}} total ablution, then wash (yourselves) and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have touched the women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith, Allah does not desire to put on you any difficulty, but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on you, so that you may be grateful."

60|$|It {{was quite}} a treat to see the cordial {{way in which the}} captain was {{received}} by such of his brother directors as sat near him, and, when he had <b>wiped</b> his bald <b>head</b> and put on his spectacles, and calmly looked round the hall, his bland visage appeared to act the part of a reflector, for, wherever his eyes were turned, there sunshine appeared to glow. In fact several of the highly sympathetic people present--of whom there are always a few in every mixed meeting--unconsciously smiled and nodded as his eye passed over their locality, even although they were personal strangers to him.|$|R

40|$|Video {{playback}} {{is becoming}} a common method for manipulating social stimuli in experiments. Parid tits {{are one of the}} most commonly studied groups of wild birds. However, it is not yet clear if tits respond to video playback or how their behavioural responses should be measured. Behaviours may also differ depending on what they observe demonstrators encountering. Here we present blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) videos of demonstrators discovering palatable or aversive prey (injected with bitter-tasting Bitrex) from coloured feeding cups. First we quantify variation in demonstrators' responses to the prey items: aversive prey provoked high rates of beak <b>wiping</b> and <b>head</b> shaking. We then show that focal blue tits respond differently to the presence of a demonstrator on a video screen, depending on whether demonstrators discover palatable or aversive prey. Focal birds faced the video screen more during aversive prey presentations, and made more head turns. Regardless of prey type, focal birds also hopped more frequently during the presence of a demonstrator (compared to a control video of a different coloured feeding cup in an empty cage). Finally, we tested if demonstrators' behaviour affected focal birds' food preferences by giving individuals a choice to forage from the same cup as a demonstrator, or from the cup in the control video. We found that only half of the individuals made their choice in accordance to social information in the videos, i. e., their foraging choices were not different from random. Individuals that chose in accordance with a demonstrator, however, made their choice faster than individuals that chose an alternative cup. Together, our results suggest that video playback can provide social cues to blue tits, but individuals vary greatly in how they use this information in their foraging decisions...|$|R
