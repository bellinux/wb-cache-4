40|$|Abstract: Necessary and {{sufficient}} {{conditions for the}} classical central limit theorem (CLT) for i. i. d. random vectors in an arbitrary separable Banach space require not only assumptions {{on the distribution of}} the data, but also on the partial sums of the data. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is to continue our study of the CLT in terms of the data itself. Of course, some new ingredient must be introduced, so we allow slight modifications of the data. In particular, we restrict our modifications to be continuous, and to be no larger than a fixed small number, or in some cases a fixed small proportion of the magnitude of the data itself. We find that if we use certain interpolation space norms to measure the magnitude of the data modifications, then the CLT can be improved. Examples of our result are also included. 1...|$|E

40|$|Forms of {{recursion}} and induction In {{these notes}} {{we look at}} the related techniques of recursion and induction. You will have seen already some of the simpler kinds of induction (over N) and you may have met some forms of recursion (such as primitive recursion) but you may not be aware of this name. Here we will go beyond these rather simple particular cases, and look at some more intricate aspects. Roughly speaking (at least for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here)</b> recursion is a way of specifying a function by saying how each of its values is related to ‘earlier’ values. You may not be familiar with the word ‘specifying ’ for it is often incorrectly replaced by ‘defining’. The meaning and the difference between these two notions will be explained later. The related technique of induction is more familiar. This is a method of proof used to verify certain facts about the functions produced by a specification. In general, for each form of recursion (which produces functions) there is an associated form of induction (which verifies properties of the functions) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1960 s the {{breakthrough}} {{that led to}} the Kirby–Siebenmann classification of PL structures on high-dimensional topological manifolds was the Kirby torus trick [K]. A few years later it was shown in a paper by A. J. S. Hamilton [H] that the torus trick could also be applied in dimension 3 to give new proofs of the earlier results of Bing and Moise on the existence and uniqueness of triangulations of 3 -manifolds. It is no surprise then that the method can be scaled down even further to prove the corresponding facts for surfaces. This is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> and in fact we take the small extra step to produce smoothings instead of triangulations. Throughout the paper we take the term “surface ” to mean a 2 -dimensional manifold, possibly with boundary, which is a Hausdorff space and has a countable dense subset, or equivalently a countable cover by coordinate charts. Theorem A. Every topological surface has a smooth structure. Theorem B. Every homeomorphism between smooth surfaces is isotopic to a diffeomorphism. Theorem B implies that smooth structures are unique not just up to diffeomorphism, but up to isotopy...|$|E
40|$|A {{preferential}} entailment {{is defined}} by a binary relation, or «preference relation». This relation may be among interpretations, or sets of interpretations, or among «states» which are «copies» of interpretations or of sets of interpretations. This provides four kinds of preferential entailments. The paper deals mainly with propositional logic, however it describes also the situation in first order logic. For instance, the third notion presented above {{can be seen as}} a way to simulate the main aspects of the simplest first notion when it is defined in the predicate calculus, while staying in the propositional calculus. Indeed, the third notion allows as many copies of interpretations as we want for a complete theory, even in the propositional calculus, and this is precisely what happens in the predicate calculus. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> is to provide a characterization result for these four kinds of preferential entailments. We choose properties as simple and natural as possible, and sometimes we provide various characterizations for the same notion. It appears that the apparently most complicated notion possesses by far the simplest characterization result. A by-product of our results is that the fourth notion is equivalent to the second notion: we may define directly the relation among sets of interpretations, eliminating the need for «states» in this case...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} formal {{treatment}} of normalization by evalua-tion in type theory. The involved semantics of simply-typed λ-calculus {{is exactly the}} simply typed fragment of the type theory. This means we have constructed and proved correct a decompilation function which re-covers the syntax of a program, provided {{it belongs to the}} simply typed fragment. The development runs and is checked in Coq. Possible appli-cations include the formal treatment of languages with binders. 1 General setting 1. 1 Deep vs. shallow The denomination "normalization by evaluation " is now well-established and designates a class of techniques dealing with functional programs. However, de-pending upon the framework these techniques are used in, the aim can vary greatly. In all cases, the idea is to translate functional programs (λ-terms) from one level of language to another. This is precisely <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> In type theory, a λ-term can exist under very different forms. Let us consider the term λx. λy. x. Given any type X of the type theory, we can build the correspond-ing program; in Coq syntax it will be fun (x:X) (y:X) => x. This is what is generally called the shallow embedding. We can however also go for the deep embedding. This involves defining a data-type describing λ-terms. Again in Coq we can take...|$|E
