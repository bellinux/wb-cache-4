The series' first two episodes were filmed entirely on IMAX digital cameras, and premiered on IMAX screens on September 1, 2017, for two weeks. ABC will then broadcast the series weekly starting with the first two episodes on September 29, 2017, with the network airing {{of the first two}} episodes featuring exclusive content, outside of the versions screened on IMAX. Select action sequences {{in the rest of the}} series were also shot on IMAX. The series was neither intended to be a reworking of the planned film from Marvel Studios, nor a spin-off from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, added that [...] "We’ve worked very carefully <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" [...] the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films. In December 2016, Scott Buck was announced as showrunner and executive producer for the series. In February 2017, Anson Mount was cast as Black Bolt. Filming began in March 2017 in Hawaii, and concluded in June.|$|E

In November 2016, Marvel and IMAX Corporation announced Marvel's Inhumans, based on the species of the same name, after a planned film based on the characters {{had been removed from}} Marvel Studios' slate. The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in IMAX theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series. Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, said, [...] "We've worked very carefully <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>friends</b> at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" [...] the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films—the theatrical run of the series will take place between the releases of Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok. The deal was initially suggested to Marvel by IMAX after they had held a successful IMAX event with Game of Thrones in 2015. Sherwood described it as [...] "a quadruple win—a win for IMAX, a win for Marvel, a win for ABC Studios and a win for ABC to launch a show in an innovative way and get attention" [...] in an increasingly crowded market. Sherwood hoped that this would be the first of [...] "several innovative ways to launch [...] programming." ...|$|E
