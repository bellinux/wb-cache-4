5|$|In 1973, {{construction}} on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One {{integral part of the}} project was a storage dam on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their negative impacts and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that {{led to the creation of}} the Central Arizona <b>Water</b> <b>Control</b> Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any storage units on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of the study to include dams for flood control.|$|E
5|$|On August28, {{or about}} three days after Katrina struck the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} a disaster area for Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which allocated federal funding for debris removal and other emergency services. Three days later, Monroe County was also declared a disaster areas, and {{on the same day}} the three counties were designated to receive funding for public assistance; this included aid to repair roads and bridges, <b>water</b> <b>control</b> facilities, public buildings, and recreation areas. The declaration was determined after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20State Emergency Response Teams {{to determine the extent of}} damage. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September6; the counties were Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton. In addition, Collier County in southwestern Florida was added to the list of disaster areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} the result of many {{cooperating}} agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the Miccosukee Indians have a reservation in between the park and <b>water</b> <b>control</b> devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.|$|E

By the end of the 2nd century CE, workers had devised a system of leather valves and bamboo pipes which drew up both brine and natural gas, which they burned to boil the brine (the technology they developed for the bamboo piping was eventually applied to household plumbing).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{controlled}} drainage (CD) on ammonia volatilization (AV) losses from paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI) was investigated by managing <b>water</b> table <b>control</b> levels using a lysimeter. Three drainage treatments were implemented, namely, <b>controlled</b> <b>water</b> table depth 1 (CWT 1), <b>controlled</b> <b>water</b> table depth 2 (CWT 2), and <b>controlled</b> <b>water</b> table depth 3 (CWT 3). As the <b>water</b> table <b>control</b> levels increased, irrigation water volumes in the CI paddy fields decreased. AV losses from paddy fields reduced {{due to the}} increases in <b>water</b> table <b>control</b> levels. Seasonal AV losses from CWT 1, CWT 2, and CWT 3 were 59. 8, 56. 7, and 53. 0 [*]kg[*]N[*]ha− 1, respectively. AV losses from CWT 3 were 13. 1 % and 8. 4 % lower than those from CWT 1 and CWT 2, respectively. A {{significant difference in the}} seasonal AV losses was confirmed between CWT 1 and CWT 3. Less weekly AV losses followed by TF and PF were also observed as the <b>water</b> table <b>control</b> levels increased. The application of CD by increasing <b>water</b> table <b>control</b> levels to a suitable level could effectively reduce irrigation water volumes and AV losses from CI paddy fields.

25|$|The Indus is a river {{system that}} sustains {{communities}} in India and Pakistan. Both have extensively dammed the Indus River for irrigation of their crops and hydro-electricity systems. In arbitrating {{the conflict in}} 1947, Sir Cyril Radcliffe, decided to demarcate the territories as {{he was unable to}} give to one or the other the control over the river as it was a main economic resource for both areas. The Line of Control (LoC) was recognised as an international border establishing that India would have control over the upper riparian and Pakistan over the lower riparian of the Indus and its tributaries.

25|$|Some {{archaeologists have}} speculated that the {{original}} speakers of ancient Sumerian may have been farmers, who moved down from the north of Mesopotamia after perfecting irrigation agriculture there. The Ubaid period pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (c. 5700 – 4900 BC C-14) in the north, who {{were the first to}} practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (Oueilli, Oueili) near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for <b>water</b> <b>control,</b> enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.|$|E
