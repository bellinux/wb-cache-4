5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highways, the {{corridor}} was to be upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, the alternatives were narrowed down to two, with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200students would {{no longer be able to}} <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in progress, with portions of the highway between Mohawk and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.|$|E

Results On study day, 34. 5 % of children <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and 36. 8 % intended <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> home.

But oh! the luxury of that winter, with no snow drifts to climb, no corn-stalks to gather and no long <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> It was sweet to wake each morning in the shelter of our little house and know that another day of delightful schooling was ours. Our hands softened and lightened. Our walk became each day less of a [...] "galumping plod."

Here was the first class still, Agnes' pride; but, behold, these are the little ones of her day, and the babies for whom she had made pink frocks and frilled caps, now stared up in her face {{responsible}} beings, who could say {{more than half the}} Catechism.

The chief sitting-room upstairs was unfortunately towards the street, and had a northern aspect; it was a spacious room, with three large windows filled with boxes of flowers, and contained a big table and two sofas, which, with the carpet and curtains, would remain well covered up. Folding-doors led into a smaller room, with a south window towards the little garden, where Mrs. Froggatt generally sat, and which had been used for the dining-room. There were two bedrooms besides on the same floor, one of which would remain untouched for Mr. Froggatt; and above these, there was a large nursery, and more rooms than had been ever furnished. Rent, rates, taxes, and repairs, all off her mind! Wilmet felt as if prosperity were setting in; and she was the first to make the audacious statement that they need not part with Martha, and indeed, that the house could not be kept in order, nor dinners cooked fit for Mr. Froggatt, by Sibby single-handed. And Cherry made up her mind that they were like a family of caterpillars moving their cobweb tent; Angela, seeing such an establishment of young tortoise-shells, in their polished black, under their family web, had asked, 'Which was their brother Felix?' and the name was adopted.|$|E

6000|$|One awoke of {{a morning}} to the twittering of birds, to <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> amidst delicate, lace-like shadows of great trees acloud with old gold: the buds lay curled like tiny {{feathers}} on the pavements.

Just so subtly, yet with the same seeming suddenness had budded and come to leaf and flower a perfect understanding, which nevertheless remained undefined. This, I had no doubt, was my fault, and due to the incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire. Although we did not altogether abandon our secret trysts, we began to meet in more natural ways; there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed together through the woods and fields, pausing to tear off, one by one, the petals of a daisy, [...] "She loves me, she loves me not." [...] I never ventured to kiss her; I always thought afterwards I might have done so, she had seemed so willing, her eyes had shone so expectantly as I sat {{beside her on the}} grass; nor can I tell why I desired to kiss her save that this was the traditional thing to do to the lady one loved. To be sure, the very touch of her hand was galvanic. Paradoxically, I saw the human side of her, the yielding gentleness that always amazed me, yet I never overcame my awe of the divine; she was a being sacrosanct. Whether this idealism were innate or the result of such romances as I had read I cannot say.... I got, indeed, an avowal of a sort. The weekly dancing classes having begun again, on one occasion when she had waltzed twice with Gene Hollister I protested.|$|E

40|$|ISSUE ADDRESSED: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine route <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> {{distance}} and mode of transport for primary school-aged children in Brisbane, and to quantify the exposure to risk of pedestrian injury by the sociodemographic characteristics of the children. METHODS: This study was part of a longitudinal cohort study of 871 Brisbane families with children aged 4 - 12 years that aimed to quantify the relationship between socio-economic status and childhood injury. Mode of transport <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and socio-demographic characteristics of children were obtained from a questionnaire completed at baseline by each child's primary carer. Route <b>to</b> <b>school</b> and distance travelled were recorded at the baseline interview on scaled geographical maps. RESULTS: Being driven by car was the predominant mode of transport <b>to</b> <b>school</b> (75 %) and from school (72 %), with the prevalence decreasing with the age of the child. The mean distance travelled <b>to</b> <b>school</b> was 3. 8 kilometres (km), with 50 % of children travelling between 1. 25 km and 4. 5 km. For children who <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> exposure <b>to</b> pedestrian injury risk was similar by gender, increased with age and was inversely related to household income and the primary carer's education level. CONCLUSION: The majority of children aged 5 - 12 live close <b>to</b> <b>school</b> but only a small minority of students walk the distance. <b>Walking</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> was least common in children from higher socio-economic backgrounds.
