Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them if they had been chided or <b>were</b> <b>upset.</b> This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E

5|$|The now-traditional {{third place}} {{play-off}} was not established until 1934, so {{the format of}} the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia. Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they <b>were</b> <b>upset</b> with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.|$|E
