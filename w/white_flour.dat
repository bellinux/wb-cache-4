5|$|The {{most common}} grains were rye, barley, buckwheat, millet and oats. Rice {{remained}} a fairly expensive import {{for most of}} the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only {{towards the end of the}} period. Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted <b>white</b> <b>flour</b> that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.|$|E

The best milling performance was obtained when {{the samples were}} conditioned to 14. 3 % moisture. Yields were 37 - 48 % for straight-run flour, 47 - 56 % for shorts, and 5 - 8 % for bran. The beta-glucan contents of the straight-run <b>white</b> <b>flours</b> were 1. 6 - 2. 1 %, of which approximate to 49 % was water-extractable.

40|$|The uses {{of white}} corn in Indonesia’s food {{industries}} are still limited. To explore the potential uses, evaluation of functional properties of <b>white</b> corn <b>flour</b> is needed. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the gelatinization properties of <b>white</b> corn <b>flour,</b> and its changes as affected by spontaneous fermentation of white corn grits and particle size of its <b>flour.</b> <b>White</b> corn <b>flour</b> was prepared by soaking of white corn grits followed by drying and grinding.

The fermented flour was fractionated by particle size using multiple sieves of 100 mesh (150 µm), 150 mesh (106 µm) and 200 mesh (75 µm) and analyzed for its chemicals, physicals and gelatinization characteristics. The result showed that the smaller particle size resulted in increased breakdown viscosity and the tendency to retrogradate. Overall, the result showed that control of length of fermentation of corn grits and particle size could be used as a mean to control breakdown viscosity and tendency to the retrogradation of the corn flour...|$|R

However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeration. Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria.|$|E

Naans are seldom, if ever, made at home since they require tandoor based cooking and require prep work.

25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take <b>white</b> <b>flour,</b> warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E

5000|$|Often, {{whole wheat}} flour is not the main {{ingredient}} in baked goods, as it may add a certain [...] "heaviness" [...] that prevents them from rising as high as <b>white</b> <b>flours.</b> This can add to the cost per volume of the baked item, as it requires more flour to obtain the same volume, due to the fewer and smaller air pockets trapped in the raised goods.

25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so <b>white</b> <b>flour</b> is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{methods of}} holding a [...] reduced fracture involved using splints. [...] These are rigid strips laid parallel {{to each other}} alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. [...] Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during the immobilization. [...] The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and egg mixture as did Medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg <b>white,</b> <b>flour,</b> and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1517–1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of wax, cardboard, cloth, and parchment that hardened as they dried.|$|E
