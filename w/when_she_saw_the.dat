5|$|When Genelia {{was offered}} a role in Tujhe Meri Kasam, {{initially}} she turned it down, as she was not keen {{to pursue a career}} in acting. But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for two months, and she agreed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Telugu version of the movie. Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to cast her in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys. Genelia was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).|$|E

25|$|Hang Tuah is {{an actual}} Malaccan {{historical}} figure, but {{his career as}} a Laksamana (Admiral) began during the reign of Sultan Mansur, who was Sultan Mahmud’s grandfather. By the time Sultan Mahmud became ruler of Malacca, Hang Tuah was an old man {{at the end of his}} life. However, the musical opts to show Tuah as still being in his prime of his career, though the age gap between him and the Princess is acknowledged by a line in the show when the Princess remarks that she was a child <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> famous Admiral Tuah for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Caddy and {{teammate}} Billie Smedts were {{embroiled in}} controversy in April {{as a result}} of an attempted prank gone wrong. The pair were arrested at gunpoint by local police after they were spotted wearing balaclavas and attempting to enter a local house in the Geelong suburb of Kardinia Park. They received a warning from police after it was revealed they were attempting to scare teammate Jackson Thurlow and had simply approached the wrong house. A concerned neighbour had called police reporting an armed robbery <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> players knock on the door of the neighbouring property. The incident was resolved without further action by police or disciplinary action by the club.|$|E
25|$|During the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion, a fourth-grade {{teacher in}} Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, saved 44 {{children}} from potentially life-threatening ballistic window glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> flash. Despite {{not knowing the}} origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's blast wave arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut. A follow up study {{of the effects of the}} meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.|$|E
500|$|Lucy O'Brien {{first came}} to like Madonna in 1985, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> singer on television, {{performing}} on The Virgin Tour. She previously thought that Madonna [...] "was that cheesy pop bimbo in lycra, writhing on a Venetian gondola for the 'Like a Virgin' video." [...] However, The Virgin Tour changed her opinion {{and by the time}} Madonna's 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan was released, O'Brien confessed that Madonna had won her admiration. The author had admired Madonna's lack of fear, and her ability to incorporate alternative culture and sexuality in her work.|$|E

500|$|Mowry's {{twin sister}} Tamera Mowry {{accompanied}} {{her to her}} audition. Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she {{said that it was}} common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that [...] " [...] very different actors". <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone. She was concerned about the sisters' wholesome image gained from their years as child actors on the sitcom Sister, Sister, explaining, [...] "I had a certain image of them. I didn't know if they wanted to go where I wanted the character to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Ten {{days before}} the film's premiere, the Church of Scientology took out full-page {{advertisements}} in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear, comparing it to the story [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] published by Rolling Stone magazine. Gibney subsequently {{said that he was}} grateful for the church's advertising, as it had attracted much publicity for the film; he only wished [...] "they'd put in showtimes". The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: [...] "Docs don’t get full page ads, and when they do, they do really well." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the first anime adaptation, the author often visited the TMS Entertainment studio, where the voice actors requested advice about their characters. Although Hoshino was nervous about talking with them, she was surprised by their dedication in practising their characters—particularly Sanae Kobayashi (Allen), Takahiro Sakurai (Kanda), Katsuyuki Konishi (Komui), and Hiroki Tōchi (Cross Marian)—and joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw Shizuka Itō's work. Early in production, Hoshino was shown {{an early version of}} the first opening theme: [...] "Innocent Sorrow" [...] by the Japanese rock band Abingdon Boys School. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> video, Hoshino began to cry in delight while the staff laughed to her. Tyki Mikk's voice actor, Toshiyuki Morikawa, remembered the recording sessions for the series as [...] "lively" [...] {{because of the presence of}} many popular actors. After the anime finished, the actors (who became friends during production) kept in touch.|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E
500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name {{not only because they}} will give away his presence, but also because they remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{members and}} friends of Anjelica's family had never known she had even existed. Anjelica's sister, Laurencita Ramirez, spoke to reporters about the case. When she was 11 she learned about Anjelica's {{existence}} and abduction by their father years earlier.

2500|$|In 1968 the {{producer}} of the Angélique films was given the job to turn Catherine, One love is Enough into a film.

Yet when French television approached her for the adaption of her second bestseller Marianne, a star for Napoleon with acclaimed director Marion Sarraut to be in charge, she agreed.|$|E
