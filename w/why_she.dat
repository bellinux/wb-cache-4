5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders <b>why</b> <b>she</b> would be represented {{as one who}} died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It {{is more likely that}} Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E

Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, which is <b>why</b> <b>she</b> only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E
