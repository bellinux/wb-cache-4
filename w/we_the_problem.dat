40|$|Do we {{have free}} will, or don’t <b>we?</b> <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> {{of free will}} is hard, and important. Indeed, I will {{argue that it is}} one of our hardest {{intellectual}} prob-lems, and it is hard because {{it is also one of}} the most important intellectual problems we face. It is our tacit or subliminal recognition of the importance of the problem that makes it so difficult. In my graduate student days, it fell to me to forge a signature on a legal document of some significance. If you must know, a friend asked me to inter-cept and deposit his fellowship stipend while he was away from Oxford during the long Christmas break. In order to prevent just such junkets, the fellow-ship authorities included with the stipend a receipt that had to be signed and returned immediately, so they could check the dates and postmarks—and sig-natures. Failure to be present and accounted for when the check arrived was grounds for termination of the fellowship. Before departing for the south of France, my friend gave me several samples of his signature, which I practiced diligently, writing it well over a hundred times, until I had it just about perfect...|$|E
40|$|Whether or not {{to provide}} {{financial}} assistance to GMH (Holden) and other manufacturers in Australia is the wrong question to ask. The industry is just too strategically important to lose. What would happen if government withdrew financial assistance to industry as the ‘free marketeers’ advocate? They argue that it {{would result in a}} more efficient allocation of resources, ensuring that only the most profitable and productive companies survive and flourish. They say that government must unleash businesses from the shackles of dependency and set them free to sink or swim in the global market place. Fierce competition in a world where companies minimise their labour costs and maximise their profits is the free market dream. We will all be winners, won’t <b>we?</b> <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> with free marketeerism is that it imagines a strangely utopian self-leveling world where any effort to support the free movement of labour and capital generates optimal economic outcomes. A real world example for this is the debate over the future of GMH (Holden) in Adelaide. There are two schools of thought prevailing. One says don’t provide any further assistance and see what happens. If GMH goes it will free up labour and capital to be more efficiently utlised in other industries. The other school of thought argues that government assistance to industry generates benefits well beyond those captured directly by GMH. In other words, the existence of a technologically sophisticated manufacturing facility like GMH fosters technological innovation throughout the region in which it exists, sustaining a high skill workforce that in turn underpins a higher standard of living than would otherwise be the case. The free marketeers reject this, arguing that resources once devoted to the auto industry would be more profitably employed elsewhere, in mining or other industries with strong growth prospects. The problem with this is that mining is equipment intensive, generating relatively few jobs, particularly when minerals are processed off shore. It also has fewer downstream benefits for other sectors, fostering less innovation than manufacturing operations. Increased reliance on mining also has a perverse impact on the exchange rate as we are witnessing at the moment with a sustained high Australian dollar. This is damaging the competitiveness of non-mining export industries. The free marketeers pleas for the abandonment of industry assistance ignores fundamental realities about the role of government in industry development since the industrial revolution. Industrialists have always been the beneficiaries of government investment and governments the beneficiaries of industry development. The forms of government assistance to industry might have changed over the last 100 years but {{there has never been a}} time when that assistance was withdrawn entirely. Some forms of industry assistance are perverse just as some corporate tax breaks are – they can have little impact on productivity and jobs. Assistance to the automotive industry has changed radically over the last 20 years from the blunt instrument of high tariffs on imported vehicles to targeted support for auto industry rationalisation and transformation to more fuel-efficient green cars. If free marketeers had their way on industry assistance we would lose the heart of our manufacturing industry to China and India in the vein hope that other industries fill the hole that is left. Lets just focus on the auto industry for a minute. Imagine filling a hole that was once occupied by a $ 4 billion per year components supply sector, a $ 4 billion per year vehicle and components export business, a sector generating 60, 000 jobs and $ 5 billion in wages and salaries and investments in R&D of over $ 700 million. This is a big hole that mining industry growth will not fill. Just how big a hole might the loss of GMH create if it were to close its operations in Adelaide? It employs around 2700 people and purchased around $ 530 million from a range of suppliers. My colleague, Associate Professor Barry Burgan for the Department of Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade Resources and Energy, recently undertook modeling of the significance of the industry to South Australia. The Burgan report reveals that GMH’s activities involve total expenditure in South Australia of around $ 930 million, contribute $ 520 million to economic growth and support around 5600 jobs. The total economic activity associated with GMH operations was estimated to be $ 1. 1 billion and around 11, 700 jobs. Taking into account any potential benefits that might flow from closure (deflationary impact on wages and housing costs) the closure could lead to losses of between $ 500 million to $ 1. 5 billion per annum in economic activity and 5950 to 16, 100 jobs in South Australia. The State Budget could be hit by losses ranging from $ 25 million to $ 83 million. Lets put all of this in the context of the industry assistance debate surrounding GMH. The best estimate of the level of assistance GMH might be seeking is between $ 150 million to $ 200 million over four years. Weighting the gains up against the losses suggests that targeted assistance to GMH is a smart investment so long as it is part of a wider strategy to help sustain the automotive industry in Australia. The signals to the industry have been mixed over the last few years with the abandonment of the Green Car Innovation Fund generating unhelpful policy uncertainty. Meanwhile the Coalition is divided in its view about whether to provide financial support to manufacturing industry at all. They have been captured by the Productivity Commissions scorched earth view that government should withdraw financial support from the automotive industry. The free marketeers dominate our major public policy institutions to our great detriment, fuelling the propagation of naïve and populist views in the hallways of Canberra and among the Third Estate. As commentators dissected Kevin Rudd’s Washington resignation speech for nuance and meaning, one contacted me to ask what was the significance of his remarks about pressures facing manufacturing industry in Australia. There is a long and short answer to this question. The short is that he announced the Green Car Innovation Fund that was axed by the Gillard Government to make budget savings. Rudd made that announcement with former Industry Minister, Kim Carr who was demoted in a Cabinet reshuffle by Julia Gillard. Former Australian Manufacturing Workers Union National Secretary, Doug Cameron was among the few to speak out in support of Kevin Rudd in the head of the leadership contest. He called for an inquiry into manufacturing industry last year – a call rejected by his leader. Given the pressures facing manufacturing in Australia including job losses of around 100, 000 nationally over the last four years we might just see a review of Australian manufacturing policy in the near future. Julia Gillard would benefit from it. – John Spoehr Photo: Flickr / brizzle born and bre...|$|E
