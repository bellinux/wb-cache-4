40|$|The rate of {{breakage}} of feed in {{ball milling}} is usually {{represented in the}} form of a first-order rate equation. The equation was developed by treating a simple batch test mill as a <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>reactor.</b> Several case of deviation from the rule have been reported in the literature. This is attributed to the fact that accumulated fines interfere with the feed material and breaking events are masked by these fines. In the present paper, a new rate equation is proposed which takes into account the retarding effect of fines during milling. For this purpose the analogy of diffusion of ions through permeable membranes is adopted, with suitable modifications. The validity of the model is cross checked with the data obtained in batch grinding of ? 850 /+ 600 ?m size quartz. The proposed equation enables calculation of the rate of breakage of the feed at any instant of time...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{compiled}} sets of gas-phase and surface reactions {{for use in}} modeling plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide from silane, oxygen and argon gas mixtures in high-density-plasma reactors. They have applied the reaction mechanisms to modeling three different kinds of high-density plasma deposition chambers, and tested them by comparing model predictions {{to a variety of}} experimental measurements. The model simulates a <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>reactor</b> by solving global conservation equations averaged across the reactor volume. The gas-phase reaction mechanism builds from fundamental electron-impact cross section data available in the literature, and also includes neutral-molecule, ion-ion, and ion-molecule reaction paths. The surface reaction mechanism is based on insight from attenuated total-reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy experiments. This mechanism describes the adsorption of radical species on an oxide surface, ion-enhanced reactions leading to species desorption from the surface layer, radical abstractions competing for surface sites, and direct energy-dependent ion sputtering of the oxide material. Experimental measurements of total ion densities, relative radical densities as functions of plasma operating conditions, and net deposition-rate have been compared to model predictions to test and modify the chemical kinetics mechanisms. Results show good quantitative agreement between model predictions and experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of azo-dyes in industrial effluents reduces wastewater transparency and oxygen solubility. Studies {{available in the}} literature on bacterial degradation of azo-dyes highlight the success of decolorization processes by microbial consortiums. The biodegradation of the monoazo-sulphonic dye Acid Orange 7 by means of Pseudomonas sp. OX 1 was investigated both in gas-sparged flasks and in internal loop airlift reactors under controlled operating conditions. Bioremediation was accomplished by a sequence of aerobic and anaerobic phases. Cell growth took place only during the aerobic phase, while dye conversion occurred only during the anaerobic phase, according to a Michaelis–Menten-type kinetics. The maximum extent of decolorization was closely correlated with the amount of substrate carbon converted during the preceding aerobic phase; a limiting conversion of 70 mgdye per gram of substrate carbon was previously measured whatever the carbon source (Lodato et al., 2007). Present contribution regards further results about the conversion of Acid Orange 7 by means of P. sp. OX 1 in an airlift biofilm reactor. A model for the simulation of the conversion process under a sequence of aerobic/anaerobic conditions is also presented. Experimental investigation was carried out in a bench-scale airlift reactor. Macro-porous pumice stones were adopted as biofilm carrier. The reactor was operated under continuous conditions – with respect to the liquid phase - during the aerobic stage and batch-wise during the anaerobic stage. Phenol supplemented synthetic medium was fed during the aerobic stages. Reference conditions assumed in the model were: spherical impervious particles wrapped of uniform biofilm in a three-phase internal loop airlift; <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>reactor</b> operated under continuous conditions with respect to both the liquid and the gas phases. Phenol was fed only during the aerobic phase whereas Acid Orange 7 was fed both during the aerobic and the anaerobic phase. The reaction network embodies: phenol conversion under aerobic conditions, oxygen depletion as a consequence of cells uptake – due to both growth and maintenance contributes - and diffusion in the biofilm, dye conversion under anaerobic conditions. The conversion kinetics were assumed in agreement with previous investigation (Viggiani et al., 2006; Lodato et al., 2007). A double substrate kinetic model was adopted for growth with phenol inhibition and oxygen Monod type kinetic. Instead as regards dye conversion a Michaelis-Menten type kinetic with oxygen inhibition was adopted when anaerobic conditions were established. Conversion process carried out with the biofilm reactor has been characterized in terms of time resolved concentration of biofilm, free cells, phenol and dye. Simulation results regard steady states conditions, aerobic or anaerobic. Results are in terms of phenol, oxygen and dye concentration in the liquid phase and throughout the bioparticle and effectiveness factors of biocatalyst. The influence of operating conditions on the effectiveness factors were also investigated. Lodato et al., 2007, Enz. Microb. Technol. 41, 646 - 652 Viggiani et al., 2006, J.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{weathering}} incongruency during soil formation from rock controls local carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, {{as well as}} the evolution of hydrologic flow paths. Prior studies of basalt weathering, including those that have quantified the dynamics of well-mixed, bench-scale laboratory reactors or characterized the structure and integrated response of field systems, indicate a strong influence of system scale on weathering rate and trajectory. For example, integrated catchment response tends to produce lower weathering rates than do <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>reactors,</b> but the mechanisms underlying these disparities remain unclear. Here we present pore water geochemistry and physical sensor data gathered during two controlled rainfall-runoff events on a large-scale convergent model hillslope mantled with 1 m uniform depth of granular basaltic porous media. The dense sampler and sensor array (1488 samplers and sensors embedded in 330 m(3) of basalt) showed that rainfall-induced dissolution of basaltic glass produced supersaturation of pore waters with respect to multiple secondary solids including allophane, gibbsite, ferrihydrite, birnessite and calcite. The spatial distribution of saturation state was heterogeneous, suggesting an accumulation of solutes leading to precipitation of secondary solids along hydrologic flow paths. Rapid dissolution of primary silicates was widespread throughout the entire hillslope, irrespective of up-gradient flowpath length. However, coherent spatial variations in solution chemistry and saturation indices were observed in depth profiles and between distinct topographic regions of the hillslope. Colloids (110 - 2000 nm) enriched in iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and phosphorus (P) were mobile in soil pore waters...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{performance}} of a two-phase anaerobic wastewater treatment system was determined {{as a function of}} the extent of recycle of the effluent from the methanogenic reactor to the acidification reactor. The system consisted of a <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> continuous <b>reactor</b> as the acidification stage, which was controlled at pH 6 by automatic addition of caustic soda, and a fluidized sand bed reactor for the methanogenic stage, which was left uncontrolled. The results showed that the introduction of recycle could minimize the total operational costs of treatment due mainly to a considerable saving in alkali addition. The results confirmed earlier model predictions. The introduction of recycle acidified the methanogenic reactor, thereby removing dissolved carbon dioxide to the gas phase; this reduction in the concentration of weak acids was the principal cause of the decrease in the caustic consumption. The effects of the recycle rate on other operating variables such as effluent pH and COD, biomass loss and methane content of the exit gas were also assessed...|$|R
40|$|Small heated-batch reactors, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as autoclave reactors, are often used in developing information for a proposed new chemical/physical processing step. These systems often entail considerable pressure buildup {{during the course of}} operation. This report describes a model formulated to simulate <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> autoclave <b>reactors.</b> The model solves a system of differential and algebraic equations which describe vapor/liquid equilibrium and chemical reactions in the reactor during a heating and cooling cycle. The model allows any number of chemical species to be defined. Phase equilibrium considerations are limited to systems with one liquid and one vapor phase, although some provisions for dealing with a second pure water liquid phase are considered. Equilibrium constraints are formulated using fugacity and activity coefficients. A new version of the general purpose differential-algebraic system solver DASSL, called DASPK, has been used to solve the system of equations. This solver has been found to work well in test problems. Selected results from a number of example problems are described.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of the project was}} {{to bridge the gap between}} our {{knowledge}} of small-scale geochemical reaction rates and reaction rates meaningful for modeling transport at core scales. The working hypothesis was that reaction rates, determined from laboratory measurements based upon reactions typically conducted in <b>well</b> <b>mixed</b> batch <b>reactors</b> using pulverized reactive media may be significantly changed in in situ porous media flow due to rock microstructure heterogeneity. Specifically we hypothesized that, generally, reactive mineral surfaces are not uniformly accessible to reactive fluids due to the random deposition of mineral grains and to the variation in flow rates within a pore network. Expected bulk reaction rates would therefore have to be correctly up-scaled to reflect such heterogeneity. The specific objective was to develop a computational tool that integrates existing measurement capabilities with pore-scale network models of fluid flow and reactive transport. The existing measurement capabilities to be integrated consisted of (a) pore space morphology, (b) rock mineralogy, and (c) geochemical reaction rates. The objective was accomplished by: (1) characterizing sedimentary sandstone rock morphology using X-ray computed microtomography, (2) mapping rock mineralogy using back-scattered electron microscopy (BSE), X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and CMT, (3) characterizing pore-accessible reactive mineral surface area, and (4) creating network models to model acidic CO{sub 2 } saturated brine injection into the sandstone rock samples...|$|R
40|$|Research {{demonstrated}} the Static Granular Bed Reactor (SGBR) to be a competitive and practical high rate anaerobic system for industrial and municipal wastewaters. Studies {{were performed to}} complete three primary goals. First, the SGBR was compared to the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor {{to demonstrate that the}} SGBR is a viable alternative in terms of performance. Next, the feasibility of municipal wastewater treatment was tested with the SGBR in both lab and pilot scale systems. Finally, the hydraulic profile was measured for the SGBR to provide a basis for modeling.;Performance between the SGBR and UASB reactor was compared in a side by side study and an experimentally designed study, which was performed to show whether or not differences in performance were statistically significant. Performance excelled for both reactors in terms of soluble COD (sCOD) removal, which exceeded 95 % for the two systems. The statistical study found the SGBR to perform better than the UASB reactor.;Treatment of municipal wastewater was rigorously tested with the SGBR. The first study was conducted at room temperature in a lab scale reactor. Five-day, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD 5) in SGBR effluent was less than 30 mg/L when the system was operated at HRTs of 48, 24, and 8 hours. A laboratory study of municipal wastewater treatment was performed at 8 and 15 °C to simulate colder weather conditions. During the low temperature study, solids entrapment appeared to be the primary organics removal mechanism for the system. Finally, a pilot reactor was set up to compare performance with initial success of the laboratory study at room temperature. Effluent CBOD 5 concentrations averaged near 50 mg/L and effluent TSS averaged less than 20 mg/L for the pilot scale study.;A tracer study was performed using lithium for the SGBR, and a parallel study performed with a UASB reactor to provide a basis for comparison.

Thus, the reactor R 2 is the most efficient reactor in comparison to other reactors. Moreover, the mechanical mixing in AB treatment does not significantly increase VS loss.

An automatic injection system was designed to inject reactant in a staged manner and to sample products.;Mixing in the Riser Simulator was studied using combined hot-film anemometry and fibre optic probes. In situ concentration and velocity measurements with the hot-film anemometer enabled to evaluate mixing times and inner recirculation gas phase ratios. The observed gas recycle ratios were above 30 with mixing times in the 20 milliseconds range.

Two separate reactor systems were used to respectively determine (1) an empirical expression describing the rate of early biofilm development and (2) estimates of individual processes contributing to net biofilm accumulation. Both objectives required the development of various detection methods sensitive to {{the early stages of}} biofilm development. The first system was a completely <b>mixed</b> <b>reactor</b> with internal recycle. It was used to determine biofilm accumulation rate as a function of three variables: suspended biomass concentration (X), Reynolds Number (Re), and reactor dilution rate (D).

The first order rate constant was directly proportional to biomass concentration and dilution rate and inversely proportional to Reynolds Number. The second system consisted of two completely <b>mixed</b> <b>reactors</b> in series, the second containing an internal recycle.
