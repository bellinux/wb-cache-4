Eva campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show, she delivered powerful speeches with heavy populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Perón's movement. Though she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she highlighted her own humble upbringing as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> solidarity with the impoverished classes.|$|E
5|$|In 1844 in Japan as the Tokugawa shogunate is in decline, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu of Akashi rapes, tortures, and murders his {{citizens}} at will. He is shielded {{because the}} Shogun is his half-brother. Sir Doi Toshitsura, the Shogun's Justice, {{realizes that the}} situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> disdain for Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers, led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings.|$|E

He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E

By spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels, the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map.|$|E

After {{stopping}} to replace a flat-spotted tyre on lap 11, his Ferrari blew its turbo halfway through lap 13. Alboreto, frustrated that Ferrari's late season reliability had cost him the World Championship (he led the points table until Round 11 at Zandvoort) drove the car back to the pits with {{the rear of the}} car on fire. He (dangerously) drove the on-fire car into the pits and straight to his Ferrari pit. Many observers saw this as Alboreto's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> that the Ferrari's unreliability had cost him the World Championship, which Prost won by finishing 4th in the race.|$|E

According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and {{make room for a}} humane and fraternal communion. It is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{communities}} in Yemen, {{prior to their}} immigration to the Land of Israel, did not place headstones over the graves of the dead, except only on rare occasions, choosing rather to follow the dictum of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who said: “They do not build monuments (i.e. tombstones) for the righteous. Their words, lo! They are their memorial!” Philosopher and Halachic decisor, Maimonides, likewise, ruled {{that it is not}} permissible to raise headstones over the graves of righteous men, but permits doing so for ordinary men. In contrast, the more recent custom of Spanish Jewry, following the teachings of the Ari z”l (Shaʿar Ha-Mitzvot, Parashat Vayeḥi), is to build tombstones over the grave, seeing it as part of the complete atonement and amendment for those who have died. Likewise, Rabbi Shelomo b. Avraham Aderet (RASHBA) wrote that it is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> honor to the dead. In this manner the custom did spread, especially among the Jews of Spain, North Africa and Ashkenaz. Today, in Israel, all Jewish graves are marked with headstones.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{small-scale}} Jesse Trees {{feature in}} prominent positions in many medieval churches, most notably under {{a statue of}} St James on the central column of the famous main entrance (the Portico de la Gloria of 1168-88) of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Another masterpiece of Romanesque stone-carving, the cloister of the Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, has a Tree on a flat panel carved in relief. Several 13th-century French cathedrals have Trees in the arches of doorways: Notre-Dame of Laon, Amiens Cathedral, and Chartres (central arch, North portal - {{as well as the}} window). However these mostly show the ancestors in archivolts on both sides of an arch, and although they are connected by tendrils, the coherence of the image is rather lost. Another popular <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> the ancestry of Christ was to have a row or gallery of statues of the Kings of Judah (part of the ancestral line from Jesse) on the facade, as at Notre Dame de Paris, but these too go beyond the image of the Tree. In a shorthand version, a statue of the Virgin and Child on an entrance trumeau to Freiburg Minster is supported by a Jesse sleeping on a chair (c. 1300).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of old age and respect towards seniors, which gone through {{significant}} change during history and that is the reason why the status of seniors in society has decreased and youth gained prominence. The main goal of this thesis based on qualitative research is to find out the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> respect to seniors and from which reasons it is so, while the accent is kept on perception of respect by four age generations. Observations and interviews revealed a discovery of typology of seniors and non-seniors, two forms of respect and four reasons <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> respect. The two main reasons <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> respect are perception of seniors as the weak ones or as heroes. The thesis develops forms and reasons of respect and thereby serves an insight into relationships and attitudes of young generations towards seniors. It revealed there are differences in <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> respect among generations. It should also give us pause to thought over sometimes big gap between these two worlds - youth and old age...|$|R

500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more interesting <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>showing</b> the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.|$|E
