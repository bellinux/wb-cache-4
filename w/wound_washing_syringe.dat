Hence, the need to ascertain the epidemiological factors associated among dog bite cases in order to plan and enhance management strategies. Objectives: To study prevailing pre-treatment practices and some epidemiological factors associated with dog bite among study population.

40|$|Intact soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr. ]) tissues show {{distinct}} proximal and distal cell {{responses to}} the Phytophthora sojae (Kauf. and Gerde.) wall glucan elicitor. Proximal cells respond with accumulations of glyceollin and phenolic polymers, whereas distal cells respond with an increase of isoflavone conjugates. Comparison of {{the activities of the}} P. sojae glucan in the classical cut cotyledon and a cotyledon infiltration assay suggests that the proximal, but not the distal, responses to elicitor require tissue <b>wounding.</b> <b>Washing</b> the surface of cut cotyledons prior to elicitor treatment also greatly diminishes the proximal responses, which can be restored in a dose-dependent manner by prior treatment of the <b>washed</b> cells with <b>wound</b> exudate from cut "donor" cotyledons. Thus, discrete wound-associated factors, which we term elicitation competency factors, are required for the proximal cell response to the glucan elicitor. The wound factors induce a competent state that is transient in nature. Maximal elicitor response is seen 2 to 3 h after wounding, and cells become elicitor nonresponsive after 4 h. Competency is markedly affected by the age of tissues; cotyledons become more inherently competent as they approach senescence. The time course of attainment of the competent state and its duration are strongly affected by light and temperature. Since the wound-associated competency factors can also be obtained from washings of hypersensitive lesions, we hypothesize that similar competency factors may be released from hypersensitively dying cells in incompatible infections. This event may program the immediately surrounding cells to make them competent for the proximal defense responses...|$|R

Most of these deaths could be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), including immediate <b>wound</b> <b>washing,</b> rabies immunoglobulin administration and vaccination. Aims: To study attitude and pre-treatment practices among the study population. Methods: Cross sectional study {{was carried out}} by conducting exit interview of 100 cases of animal bite each from three hospitals run by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Observations: Total 300 cases of animal bites were studied in the present study. Most common biting animal was dog as 97. 33 % cases gave history of dog bite. Almost half of the cases belonged to age group less than 20 years with mean age of 19 + 20. 2 years and male to female ratio was 3 : 1.

40|$|Background: Ethnopharmacology {{has been}} seen as a multidisciplinatary {{approach}} for novel drug discovery by providing valuable data about medicinal plants in different cultures. The aim of this ethnopharmacological study was to identify medicinal plants of the Genaveh port in the North of Persian Gulf. Material and Methods: The medical uses of medicinal plants were gathered from 30 local informants by face to face interview. The relative frequency of citation (FRC) and cultural importance (CI) indices were calculated. Results: A total of 93 medicinal plants belonging to 55 families were identified. Plantago psyllium, Teucrium polium, Peganum harmala, Descuraninia sophia, Cichorium intybus, Achillea erophora DC, Matricarria charmomilla and Citrolus colocynthis had the highest cultural importance indices. Plantago psyllium, Descuraninia sophia and Zataria multiflora had the highest FRC indices. The highest medical uses were for gastrointestinal diseases, gynocological diseases, respiratory disorders, infectious diseases, nature of cool and metabolic disorders, respectively. In addition to the use of these plants to treat diseases as in Iran’s traditional medicine, people in the Genaveh port particularly use Plantago psyllium for drainage of infective boils and abscesses, cough, skin diseases, Teucrium polium for diabetes mellitus, <b>wound</b> <b>washing</b> and sterilizing, Peganum harmala for uterus infections and abdominal cramps, Descuraninia sophia for heart diseases and heatstroke, Cichorium intybus for heatstroke and liver diseases, Achillea eriophora DC for reflex, diabetes mellitus and wound healing, Matricarria charmomilla for seizure and dysmenorrhea, Citrolus colocynthis for hemorrhoid, diabetes mellitus and rheumatism and Zataria multiflora for sedation, abdominal pain and respiratory diseases. Conclusion: There is a vast variety of medicinal plants in Genaveh port. Although most of therapeutic applications of these plants in the Genaveh port are the same as Iran’s traditional medicine, but the people of this region use some of these plants for some diseases which are unique for this area. Thus, investigation about these plants should be initiated to discover novel drugs for clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Following {{rabies virus}} (RABV) exposure, a {{combination}} of thorough <b>wound</b> <b>washing,</b> multiple-dose vaccine administration and the local infiltration of rabies immune globulin (RIG) are essential components of modern post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Although modern cell-culture-based rabies vaccines are increasingly used in many countries, RIG is much less available. The prohibitive cost of polyclonal serum RIG products has prompted a search for alternatives and design of anti-RABV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that can be manufactured {{on a large scale}} with a consistent potency and lower production costs. Robust in vitro neutralization activity has been demonstrated for the CL 184 MAb cocktail, a 1 : 1 protein mixture of two human anti-RABV MAbs (CR 57 /CR 4098), against a large panel of RABV isolates. In this study, we used a hamster model to evaluate the efficacy of experimental PEP against a lethal challenge. Various doses of CL 184 and commercial rabies vaccine were assessed for the ability to protect against lethal infection with representatives of four distinct bat RABV lineages of public health relevance: silver-haired bat (Ln RABV); western canyon bat (Ph RABV); big brown bat (Ef-w 1 RABV) and Mexican free-tailed bat RABV (Tb RABV). 42 – 100 % of animals survived bat RABV infection when CL 184 (in combination with the vaccine) was administered. A dose-response relationship was observed with decreasing doses of CL 184 resulting in increasing mortality. Importantly, CL 184 was highly effective in neutralizing and clearing Ph RABV in vivo, even though CR 4098 does not neutralize this virus in vitro. By comparison, 19 – 95 % survivorship was observed if human RIG (20 IU/kg) and vaccine were used following challenge with different bat viruses. Based on our results, CL 184 represents an efficacious alternative for RIG. Both large-scale and lower cost production could ensure better availability and affordability of this critical life-saving biologic in rabies enzootic countries and as such, significantly contribute to the reduction of human rabies deaths globally...|$|R

Results: The increase of PDRs and FHCs {{was associated with the}} decrease of syringe volume, the increase of needle size and the decrease of sample volume: from 2. 0 % and 100 IU/mL in 10 mL-syringe to 7. 0 % and 351 IU/mL in 1 mL-syringe; from 4. 9 % and 245 IU/mL in 26 G to 7. 6 % and 380 IU/mL in 20 G with combined 1 mL syringe; from 2. 0 % and 100 IU/mL in full-filled sample to 34 % and 1675 IU/mL in 0. 5 mL suctioned sample into 10 mL-syringe. There was no statistical difference in pH; but the percent decreasing in pCO 2, K+, iCa 2 +, iMg 2 +; the percent increasing in pO 2 and Na+ were sta-tistical significance compared to samples full-filled in syringes. The all changes in pH and pO 2 were acceptable; but the changes in pCO 2, Na+, K+ and iCa 2 + were unacceptable according to TEa limits except fullfilled-syringes. Conclusions: The changes in PDRs and FHCs due nonstandardized sampling in <b>syringe</b> <b>washed</b> with liquid heparin give rise to erroneous test results for pCO 2 and electrolytes...|$|R
