5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was time interval working, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E

500|$|In April 1988, Norwegian {{regional}} airline Norving terminated all {{scheduled services}} in Southern Norway. As a consequence, airports such as Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, were left without an airline {{and services to}} the capital, Oslo. [...] Teddy Air was subsequently established as a Skien-based company to provide an air route between Skien and Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Founded by Harald Sørensen in 1989, the largest owners were Skien Business Development Fund and Telemark Business Development Fund. It would provide four round trips with a Britten-Norman Islander. The company stated that it needed 8,000 passengers annually to cover costs, with the ticket price set at about 500 Norwegian krone (NOK). The fiercest competition would come from the Vestfold Line of the Norwegian State Railways, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> from Skien to Oslo ran each hour. The three-hour train trip cost NOK167, compared to the 25-minute flight. Concession was granted by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in August 1989, but the airline did not commence operations until 18July 1990.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Best {{starting}} {{on the main}} contract, Holme and King had been awarded a contract in April 1902 to build a road from Lofthouse to Angram. Bradford had purchased enough land to allow the light railway to be built beside the road, and although Best was awarded a contact for the railway in 1903, it appears that Holme and King built a [...] gauge contractor's railway beside part {{or all of the}} road. They had two locomotives on site, both 0-4-0 saddle tanks, one bought second hand some years earlier and moved to the site in spring 1902, after working on several other projects, and the second bought new for delivery to Pateley Bridge. By mid-1904, there was a [...] line from Angram, which crossed the River Nidd on a [...] bridge just before it reached Lofthouse. Best began extending the line towards Pateley Bridge, and by 13 July 1904, it had reached a level crossing at Sykes Bank, [...] below Lofthouse, and work had commenced at several other sites. On that date, a party of 150 members of Bradford City Council, with invited guests, arrived by train at Pateley Bridge, and were transported to Gouthwaite Dam in carriages. Here there was a ceremony in which the Lord Major cut the first sod for the Nidd Valley Light Railway. The party then proceeded to Sykes Bank, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> was waiting, which consisted of 15 wagons fitted with makeshift seats, and two locomotives, one of which was Holme and King's Xit and the other was Best's Angram. It took about an hour to reach Angram, where there were presentations, and Alderman Holdsworth cut the first sod for the dam. Refreshments were then served and the party returned to Lofthouse by train and to Pateley Bridge by carriage.|$|E
