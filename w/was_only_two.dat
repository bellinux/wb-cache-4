5|$|Amenemhat IV {{first came}} to power as a junior coregent of his {{predecessor}} Amenemhat III, whose reign marks {{the apex of the}} Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where the names of the two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars believe it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> years long. The Turin Canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period, records Amenemhat IV on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina again {{consulted}} Day on {{the prospective}} engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age difference was too great, although Bicknell <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> {{years older than}} Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sabrina {{the truth about the}} experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sabrina wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclave}} {{began on}} February 15, 1769. Initially only 27 cardinals participated. Zelanti, {{taking advantage of}} the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. In one ballot he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, but, fortunately for them, Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown-cardinal present in the early ballots, was able to join some neutral cardinals to block Chigi’s candidature.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I, {{and the costs}} of the new mortgage, placed a significant financial strain on the members, and in 1915 they decided to release Friedlander from his contract. Temple Sinai hired Harvey B. Franklin as rabbi in 1917, but his tenure there <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> years. During his term, the congregational school held classes twice a week, and had 285 students and 8 teachers. Franklin next served at Bickur Cholim in San Jose—the congregation from which Temple Sinai's first rabbi, Myer Solomon Levy, had come.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{started at}} 6:15p.m. local {{time as a}} {{waterspout}} over Community Lake, just west of town. It then moved {{through the center of}} town along Christian Street, damaging almost every structure as it went. The tornado tore houses from their foundations, throwing some more than 600 feet (180 meters). A receipt from the town was later found 65 miles (105km) east in Peacedale, Rhode Island. Large trees were uprooted and snapped, and those that were still standing were stripped of small limbs and leaves. The Catholic Church was blown to bits, and heavy tombstones in the nearby cemetery were tossed around. The brand-new brick high school building was almost completely destroyed. The tornado's path through town <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> miles long, but the damage path was up to 600 feet (180 meters) wide.|$|E
5|$|In 837, Theophilos {{raised him}} {{to the rank of}} patrikios and sent him {{together}} with the general Theophobos in a campaign against the Abasgians, but the Byzantines were defeated. With the death of Theophilos, the young Michael III (r. 842–867) ascended the throne. As he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> years old, a regency council was set up headed by Theodora. Bardas and his brother Petronas, as well as their relative Sergios Niketiates, were also members, but it was the logothete Theoktistos who quickly established himself as Theodora's chief advisor. Bardas still played {{an active role in the}} early days of the regency, encouraging Theodora to abandon Iconoclasm for good and taking part in the investigations that led to the deposition of the pro-iconoclast patriarch John the Grammarian and the restoration of the veneration of icons in 843. In 844, however, Theoktistos blamed Bardas for the desertions that led to the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Mauropotamos against the Abbasids, even though the logothete himself led the Byzantine army, and had him exiled from Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|In the semi-finals, now best-of-11, Higgins took 73 {{minutes to}} {{whitewash}} Murphy 6–0, scoring breaks of 58, 114, 57, 89, and completing the victory {{with a total}} clearance of 144, the highest break so far. The time of 73 minutes <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> minutes slower than the quickest best-of-11 match—the semi-finals of the 1993 International Open between Hendry and Dave Harold—and Higgins outscored Murphy 566–72. In the first three frames, Murphy managed to score a total of 10 points. In the fourth, Murphy broke down on a break of 50 before Higgins fluked a yellow, enabling {{him to make a}} 57 break. He then fortuitously snooked Murphy on the pink, which Higgins potted to make it 4–0. An 89 break extended Higgins' lead, before he finished the match with a 144 break. Higgins attributed his performance to a shortening of his cue.|$|E
5|$|The line of Beauchamps Earls {{ended in}} 1449 when Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick, died. Richard Neville became the next Earl of Warwick through his wife's {{inheritance}} of the title. During {{the summer of}} 1469, Neville rebelled against King Edward IV and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville attempted to rule in the king's name; however, constant protests by the king's supporters forced the Earl to release the king. Neville was subsequently killed in the Battle of Barnet, fighting against King Edward IV in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. George Plantagenet was executed in 1478 and his lands passed onto Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick; however, Edward Plantagenet <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> when his father died so his lands were taken {{in the custody of}} The Crown. He was placed under attainder, and so could not inherit the throne, by Henry VII, being held by Henry for fourteen years in the Tower of London until he was executed for high treason in 1499, supposedly for conspiring to escape with the 'pretender' Perkin Warbeck. Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title's first creation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Mary's childhood, Henry {{negotiated}} potential future marriages for her. When she <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> years old, she {{was promised}} to Francis, the infant son of King Francis I of France, but {{the contract was}} repudiated after three years. In 1522, {{at the age of}} six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old first cousin, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, the engagement was broken off within a few years by Charles with Henry's agreement. Cardinal Wolsey, Henry's chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested that Mary marry the Dauphin's father, King Francis I himself, who was eager for an alliance with England. A marriage treaty was signed which provided that Mary marry either Francis I or his second son Henry, Duke of Orleans, but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage.|$|E

5|$|When {{the plans}} for the British {{airborne}} operations were being discussed, Lieutenant-Colonel George Chatterton, the commander of No. 2 Wing, Glider Pilot Regiment, brought up a problem with the only glider then in theatre, the American Waco CG-4, known in British service as the Hadrian: its small size. The Waco's capacity <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> pilots and thirteen troops, and for cargo either a jeep or an artillery gun but not both together. The plan for Operation Ladbroke involved a coup de main assault on the Ponte Grande Bridge by the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. Using the Horsa glider, which could carry twenty-seven troops or a jeep and gun together, they could deliver a larger force at the bridge during the initial assault. Chatterton decided he needed around forty Horsas, as well as the American Wacos, for the British missions.|$|E
5|$|Zur's {{maneuver}} sent Israel's {{forces into}} unknown territory, and they encountered an Egyptian entrenchment that caught them unawares. His original {{plan was to}} send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi's company, but when fire was opened on Harpaz's men (at approximately 04:00), Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault. Harpaz decided {{to do this in}} three single-platoon waves: the first two would attack the Egyptians, while the third would provide cover for the forces. The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt's army. After advancing, they encountered what were probably Bren carriers, which their commander reported were tanks. Harpaz then sent the second, more experienced, platoon of 15 men, who were also able to better utilize the cover fire. Eventually, the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered to do so and the attack <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> platoons strong. However, this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer {{on the other side of}} the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Division {{was sent}} to France in November 1914; {{immediately}} after arrival, two battalions were deployed to hold {{a section of the}} front line for a week during the closing stages of the First Battle of Ypres. However, the brigade did not see its first major action under Pinney's command until 10 March 1915, when it was committed to action as part of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. The 23rd Brigade met heavy resistance when it began its attack, due to a failure by the divisional artillery to bombard a large section of the defenders' trenches; the 2nd Middlesex, making a frontal attack, were wiped out almost completely. The other lead battalion of the brigade, the 2nd Cameronians, was enfiladed from the undamaged sector and took heavy losses, losing almost all its officers and retreating in confusion. Pinney quickly learned of this—he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> hundred yards from the front line—and decided to continue the attack. As {{he was not able to}} call for artillery support, the only possible approach was to send in the two reserve battalions. The second assault suffered heavy casualties at the outset, and quickly had to be called off when it was discovered that the corps artillery was about to fire on the positions being attacked; the Devonshires and West Yorkshires were withdrawn, having taken high casualties and achieved little. After this, the attack continued to bog down, and whilst there was some success elsewhere in the divisional sector, nothing more was achieved by 23rd Brigade. Following Neuve Chapelle, the brigade was reinforced with two Territorial battalions. At the Battle of Aubers on 9 May, 23rd Brigade was held in reserve by 8th Division and so escaped the heavy casualties of the two attacking brigades. Around noon a scratch force of all available infantry was pushed forward by the divisional commander to support these two brigades, including some units of Pinney's brigade.|$|E
