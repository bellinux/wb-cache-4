2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids before you go to sleep!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1983 Noel Crombie briefly {{stepped into}} the limelight and issued a quaint novelty solo single, [...] "My Voice Keeps Changing On Me" [...] and the same month, the new Enz single [...] "Next Exit" [...] was {{released}} as a stop-gap until the band could record a new album, but it failed to chart. Up to this time, Tim had been the primary writer in the group, but on the next LP his contributions were overshadowed {{for the first time}} by Neil, who wrote the majority of songs. The aptly titled Conflicting Emotions (November 1983) was less cohesive than the previous three albums, and (perhaps inevitably after three successive #1 LPs) it was a commercial letdown, reaching only #13 on the national chart in January, [...] Nevertheless Neil's songs fared well commercially -- the jazzy [...] "Straight Old Line" [...] (October 1983), the anthemic [...] "Message To My Girl" [...] (January 1984) and [...] "I <b>Wake</b> <b>Up</b> <b>Every</b> Night" [...] (April 1984) all appeared as singles. [...] "Straight Old Line" [...] peaked at #31, but [...] "Message To My Girl" [...] became a major hit and reached #6 on the Australian chart in February.|$|E

Though she is a black woman, Lemmons identifies herself as an artist first and foremost in her career.“…I don't <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> day saying I'm a black woman because it's too given, but I <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> day feeling like an artist and I feel I'm an artist." ...|$|E
