5|$|The {{clarinet}} {{is widely}} used as a solo instrument. The relatively late evolution of the clarinet (<b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> orchestral woodwinds) has left solo repertoire from the Classical period and later, but few works from the Baroque era. Many clarinet concertos have been written to showcase the instrument, with the concerti by Mozart, Copland, and Weber being well known.|$|E

Gamekult.com's Usul wrote that The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy had a superior design and richer gameplay experience than Pokémon Pinball. Craig Harris expressed {{a preference for}} the previous Nintendo pinball releases. The game {{was described as a}} remake of Pokémon Pinball by Frank Provo, who expressed disappointment at the absence of Pikachu and other Pokémon. Brett Alan Weiss argued that the cute visuals of The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy was derivative <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> pinball games. He wrote that the game would appeal primarily to young girls, while experienced pinball players would prefer Pokémon Pinball.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those {{not used to}} action games, with further praise going to the control scheme. Computer and Video Games, reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera. The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge. In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles. Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although {{he noted that the}} normal melee combat lacked sophistication <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> titles available at the time. Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive. Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience. Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them. Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.|$|E
5|$|Primatologist Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> wild orangutans. The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E

5|$|Senators elect a President {{to serve}} as {{presiding}} officer of the legislative body, {{as well as a}} President Pro Tempore. The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees, four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees. <b>When</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> state legislatures in the United States, the Maryland Senate has one of the strongest presiding officers and some of the strongest committee chairs. Senators are also organized into caucuses, including party- and demographically-based caucuses. They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non-partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 study defined Deinocheiridae as a clade {{including}} all taxa {{with a more}} recent common ancestor with Deinocheirusmirificus than with Ornithomimusvelox. The three members share various anatomical features in the limbs. The 2014 cladogram suggested that ornithomimosaurians diverged into two major lineages in the Early Cretaceous; Deinocheiridae and Ornithomimidae. Unlike other ornithomimosaurians, deinocheirids were not built for running. The anatomical peculiarities of Deinocheirus <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other,</b> much smaller ornithomimosaurs, can largely be explained by its much larger size and weight. Deinocheirids and the smaller ornithomimids did not have teeth, unlike more primitive ornithomimosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (<b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|Also {{developed}} by Probe Entertainment, the Sega Game Gear and Master System ports {{are similar to}} the Game Boy port, but in color instead of in monochrome. Both of them are almost identical, except for the reduced size of the Game Gear screen, featuring the same fighters and arenas as the Game Boy port, but with the addition of Kintaro. The arena where players fight Jade and Smoke is exclusive to each version. Unlike the Game Boy version, blood is present, but was drastically reduced in quantity <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> ports. Because of the systems' limited graphical resources, some of the Fatalities in the game were altered to completely destroy the opponent's body, leaving generic gibs of bones and limbs, while others were also simplified to use common animations.|$|E
5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
