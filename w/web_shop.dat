40|$|Finding {{a product}} with high quality and {{reasonable}} price online {{is a difficult}} task due to the fuzzy nature of data and queries. In order to handle the fuzzy problem, a new type- 2 fuzzy reasoning based decision support system, the <b>Web</b> <b>Shopping</b> Expert for online users is proposed. In the <b>Web</b> <b>Shopping</b> Expert, an interval type- 2 fuzzy logic system is used and a fuzzy output can be obtained using the up-low limit technique, which offers an opportunity to directly employ all the rules and methods of the type- 1 fuzzy sets onto the type- 2 fuzzy sets. To achieve the best performance the fuzzy inference system is optimized by the least square and numerical method. The key advantages of the least square method are the efficient use of samples and {{the simplicity of the}} implementation.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of consumers and marketers within the Web environment, particularly for retailing/purchasing {{is a growing}} area of importance. This paper focuses on examining Internet users adoption of the Web for retail usage. It uses the Technology Acceptance Model Davis (Int. J. Man-Mach. Studies 38 (1993) 475) as a theoretical foundation to explore adoption of this technology for retail usage. The study also adds what are argued to be key consumer characteristics such as Opinion Leadership, Impulsiveness, <b>Web</b> <b>Shopping</b> Compatibility, Internet Self-Efficacy, Perceived Web Security, Satisfaction with <b>web</b> sites, and <b>Shopping</b> Orientation to understand the adoption of Web retailing by Internet users'. A Web based survey was developed and administered, yielding 392 responses. The findings indicate that TAM is a valid theoretical framework to understand users adoption of the Web for retail purposes. Also Internet users' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were effected differentially by Opinion Leadership, <b>Web</b> <b>Shopping</b> Compatibility, Internet Self-Efficacy, Perceived Web Security, Impulsiveness, Satisfaction with <b>web</b> sites, and <b>Shopping</b> Orientation.
