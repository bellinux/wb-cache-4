500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E

Robert Christgau was less impressed, accusing Madonna of pandering to the [...] "" [...] of young listeners with ambiguous lyrics and over-promotion. Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "True Blue isn't revolutionary music, {{but it is}} imaginative, highly energized pop that recognizes the limitations and pleasures of Top 40 fare." [...] Erica Wexler from Spin commented that [...] "True Blue is Madonna's rite of passage between pop adolescence and a harsher adult world. With all her contrivances and the delighted tunes that I can't exorcise from my head, her mystique is still explained by the young beefcake <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'I love to pump iron to Madonna'." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E

2500|$|Jennifer Judith Jones {{was born}} to Larry and Carol Jones who were both curlers. She also has a sister named Heather 18 months older.

Larry Jones started teaching Jones when she was 11 although Jones' interest of the sport took up before that, in a daycare at the St. Vital Curling Club. She attended General Vanier School in South Winnipeg from kindergarten to grade 8. After, she attended Windsor Park Collegiate. At that point, Jones was proficient at Volleyball and Curling.

2500|$|Two more {{exceptional}} runs {{took place}} at The Palace during the last decades of the 20th century: Jesus Christ Superstar (3,358 performances from 1972 to 1980) and Les Misérables, which played at the theatre for nineteen years after moving from the Barbican Centre on 4 December 1985. The production moved to the Queen's Theatre on April 2004 to continue its record-setting run. [...] In between, Song and Dance played from 1982 to 1984. [...] In 1983, Andrew Lloyd Webber purchased the theatre for £1.3 million and {{began a series of}} renovations to the auditorium, including uncovering the famous marble and onyx panels lurking below a layer of paint. [...] He restored the theatre's facade, later commenting: [...] "I removed the huge neon sign that defaced the glorious terracotta exterior, much to the chagrin of West End producers <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I had removed the greatest theatre advertising sight in London." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clark often {{expressed}} {{pleasure at}} the flogging of convicts, although rarely performed the punishment himself. After one incident, {{in which a}} particularly troublesome female convict, Elizbaeth Dudgeon, was punished for insulting a guard officer, he noted [...] "she has long been fishing for it, which she has at last got to her heart's content". He did, however, occasionally empathise with the convicts, especially when they were mistreated. Shortly after landing on Norfolk Island, Clark and Robert Kellow came across some convicts, including some women with their children, who {{had been forced to}} sleep in the open far from the main townsite, adequate accommodation being lacking: [...] "on the Road we met a great many of the Convicts both Men and Women Particular the women that have young children <b>Who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that the have been obliged to Sleep in the woods all night for the could not get into Town, poor Devils how they are Kick about from one place to a nother". Unusually for the time, Clark was effectively a teetotaller, preferring to drink only lemonade. He often privately chastised his fellow officers' drinking habits, boasting in his diary that he had only been intoxicated once—at his wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Coates' {{testimony}} included accusations {{similar to}} those made by Adams, stating, [...] "I had people <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> point-blank that [...] didn't come to the voting rights section to sue African American people." [...] He compared the New Black Panther case to an earlier case from 2006, in which Department of Justice attorneys expressed anger at having to investigate Ike Brown, a black Democratic politician in Noxubee County, Mississippi accused of discriminating against white voters. Coates testified that the Justice Department's administration's decision to drop the Black Panther Case [...] "was intended to send a direct message to people {{inside and outside the}} civil rights division. That message is that the filing of voting cases like the Ike Brown and the NBPP cases would not continue in the Obama administration." [...] Coates testified that one of his superiors appointed by the Obama Administration had prohibited him from asking job applicants if they would enforce the voting laws in a race-neutral manner. Attorney General Holder denied these claims, stating [...] "The notion that we are enforcing any Civil Rights laws, voting or other, on the basis of race, ethnicity, or gender is simply false." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lacking the {{photogenic}} {{looks of}} many of his rock and roll contemporaries, Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, no presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an [...] "anonymous celebrity". After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had {{a good sense of humor}} and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume, then and now, that the stationary performer was blind. The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion. Years later Orbison said, [...] "I wasn't trying to be weird, you know? I didn't have a manager <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to dress or how to present myself or anything. But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to a {{widespread}} practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, {{most of the}} destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he [...] "was stopped by a fireman <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… {{they were told that}} they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city." [...] Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and un-reinforced concrete are resistance to fire but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.|$|E
