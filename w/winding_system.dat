500|$|Roebling first {{signed on}} as a {{surveyor}} for the Beaver River canal system, launching his career {{with a string of}} canal and railroad projects. [...] Aside from writing articles in engineering journals, Roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them; the John A. Roebling Company was the first wire rope manufacturer in the United States. [...] Gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering, Roebling finally got to build suspension bridges. [...] His first bridge was the Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct in Pittsburgh. [...] The structure, completed in 1845, was the first suspension aqueduct {{in the world and the}} first large American suspension bridge that had multiple spans. [...] Furthermore, it was the first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques—Roebling's own invention. [...] Earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating the main cables at a factory, transporting them to the bridge site, and then stretching the heavy cables over the gap to erect them over the bridge. [...] Roebling, during his experiments with wire ropes, conceived and patented a new construction method for these main cables. [...] A long linethe traveler ropeformed a loop around two horizontal wheels, one on each side of the gorge. [...] A lightweight wheel, [...] "the traveling wheel", was attached to this line, and a wire threaded around this wheel. [...] Like a belt in a mechanical system, the traveler rope and its wheel moved across the gap as the horizontal wheels turned, pulling the wire along. [...] The traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of the same wire (running above and under the traveling wheel) across the gap at a time. [...] The lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands, which were later compressed together into the main cables. which supported themselves and later the proportional weight of the bridge as they were formed. [...] The method became the standard for suspension bridge construction, and remained unchanged for many years. [...] In the 20th century, suspension bridges were still built with this pulley <b>winding</b> <b>system,</b> albeit with more sophisticated equipment.|$|E

40|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> {{sets the}} {{operational}} {{conditions for the}} organ pipes. The pipe foot pressure is by nature very unsteady and {{is a result of}} the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> response to the activities of the organ player. Changing flows create propagating pressure waves. These are spread in the <b>wind</b> <b>system,</b> interact with each other and are reflected at the system boundaries. This investigation is in many aspects related to the newly reconstructed baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka, Göteborg, Sweden. The dynamic behaviour of the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> was studied by means of measurements and numerical simulations. The full scale laboratory test rig was used to illustrate component characteristics as well as system performance. Among the many results achieved, the very strong influence of the wind trunk length on the pallet box pressure is to be pointed out. Unlike pallet box pressures, transient pressures in the tone channel can easily be affected by the organ player by means of sensitive fingering at key attack and release. Computer simulations as well as test rig measurements confirm this behaviour and illustrate the impacts of several design parameters. By means of section valves, different <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> layouts were created and tested in Örgryte. The flexible system in Örgryte offers a certain amount of freedom to tune the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> to suit the type of music played.

The proposed control system regulates effectively reactive power output of the DFIG wind turbine by controlling both grid-side and rotor-side converters to compensate the reactive power absorbed by the SCIG-based wind turbine.

40|$|Abstract: The {{atmospheric}} environment {{inside and}} outside historical organs in several European regions is reported. In each region, comparisons were made between an instrument suffering organ pipe corrosion and an organ without corrosion problems. Concentrations of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), formic acid (methanoic acid), acetaldehyde (ethanal), formaldehyde (methanal) and other volatile organic compounds in the organ environment were determined using active sampling. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded. In addition, polished metal samples that mimic the material used in the historical organ pipes have been exposed in the organ <b>wind</b> <b>systems</b> for up to 22 months.

The project had been delayed due to a lawsuit stating the government was using its power of eminent domain incorrectly, but the Tennessee Supreme Court found in favor of the city. Instead of a <b>winding</b> <b>system</b> of meandering parkways, Kessler decided to create a rectangular border around the city of Memphis using some existing streets. South Parkway and East Parkway (originally Trezevant Street) were constructed first. North Parkway was originally known as Summer Avenue (the name still carried by the route as it continues east from the intersection of North and East Parkways). North Parkway was also known as Speedway. Kessler originally designed parts of the Parkway System to be straight portions of tree-lined avenues where car and carriage owners could race against each other. However, the city of Memphis ended this practice in 1910 and imposed a speed limit on the entire system. Today, the road's racing past can still be seen {{in the name of the}} Speedway Terrace Historical District along North Parkway near Watkins Street.|$|E
50|$|Plugged tooth coils are {{frequently}} {{used in a}} star-shaped stator design where a final ring or yoke is mounted after the assembly of the coils. Inside slotted stator laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug-in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As {{for the type of}} insulation, it is possible - as with the classical single teeth - to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If insert molding is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a needle <b>winding</b> <b>system,</b> flyer winding technique or linear winding technique.Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase-wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and-clamp contacts per coil {{are frequently}} used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts.|$|E
