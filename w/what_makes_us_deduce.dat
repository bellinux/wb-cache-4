40|$|<b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> happy?” This {{question}} has been posed for centuries, starting with the ancient Greek philosophers and persisting with today’s celebrities, researchers, and the media. Research has shown a link between life satisfaction and physical and emotional health, which spurs us to identify the things that <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happier and healthier. We sought to understand: Does the “joy of giving” lead to a happier life? Women Give 2017 is a step forward in understanding <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> happy.

5000|$|The Kanazawa Project, 2002, titled [...] "Generations in Time" [...] was {{sponsored}} by the city government of Kanazawa, Japan to mark the 40th anniversary of its sister-city program with Buffalo, New York. Tetkowski organized one hundred people consecutively aged from one to one hundred, to place their handprint in a huge clay mandala. The hand prints move outward in a chronological spiral. The result is a portrait of a generation, and a celebration of not <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> American or Japanese but <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> human.

40|$|This {{project is}} a book-length {{collection}} of poems, organized in three sections. The first section deals with seemingly younger voices and subjects such as childhood, formative familial relationships, and coming-of-age experiences. The middle section deals with poems of place largely set in Silicon Valley in Northern California. This middle section includes an experimental group of poems engaged with personal, social, and spiritual notions of in-betweenness. The last section is concerned with questions such as: <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> who we are; <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> human; <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> alive? Most poems are written in free verse, but I have experimented with blank verse, the sonnet, the villanelle, quatrains, and sestets and include poems written in those forms. I use dance as a metaphor to explore imagination and experience and examine how personal and geographic landscapes shape consciousness. In several poems, I also experiment with ephemera, place (personal and geographic), and performance in connection with art, spirituality, culture, and identity. In a sense, my collection may be read as an 2 ̆ 2 interpretive dance 2 ̆ 2 of engagement with ideas of permanence, impermanence, and in-betweenness...|$|R

Biologists, doctors, statisticians, sociologists {{and historians}} all study health and disease. This book {{describes}} the basic methods of investigation used by all these professional, and shows how they are related and how they differ. The book works through examples such as diabetes and spina bifida to demonstrate how the causation of disease can be studied at many different levels - from microscopic processes within body cells to large-scale matters like the relationships between different groups of people in society. The aim is to provide readers with a critical understanding {{of the ways in}} which our knowledge of health and disease was arrived at, and to show how knowledge from various disciplines can fit together to provide a full picture of health and disease in our world...|$|R
