5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as <b>widened</b> in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was <b>widened</b> by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were <b>widened,</b> new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, MD410 was {{extended}} even further east and saw significant improvement on its extant sections.

In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion of efforts to widen the road to 40 feet.

5|$|Before 1832, Quarrington {{was in the}} Lincolnshire {{parliamentary}} constituency, which encompassed all {{the county}} except for four boroughs. In the 1818 election, 49 of the 2,000 people living in New and Old Sleaford and Quarrington qualified to vote. In 1832, the Reform Act <b>widened</b> the franchise and divided Lincolnshire. Quarrington was in the South Lincolnshire constituency that elected two members to parliament. The franchise was <b>widened</b> by the reforms so that roughly 15% (202) of males in Sleaford and Quarrington could vote in 1868. The constituency was abolished in 1885 and Quarrington was in the new North Kesteven constituency. It merged with the Grantham seat in 1918. In 1997, Quarrington was reorganised into Sleaford and North Hykeham.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of static {{analysis}} via abstract interpretation, convex polyhedra constitute the most used abstract domain among those capturing numerical relational information. Since the domain of convex polyhedra admits infinite ascending chains, {{it has to be}} used in conjunction with appropriate mechanisms for enforcing and accelerating the convergence of fixpoint computations. <b>Widening</b> operators provide a simple and general characterization for such mechanisms. For the domain of convex polyhedra, the original <b>widening</b> operator proposed by Cousot and Halbwachs amply deserves the name of standard <b>widening</b> since most analysis and verification tools that employ convex polyhedra also employ that operator. Nonetheless, there is an unfulfilled demand for more precise <b>widening</b> operators. In this paper, after a formal introduction to the standard <b>widening</b> where we clarify some aspects that are often overlooked, we embark on the challenging task of improving on it. We present a framework for the systematic definition of new <b>widening</b> operators that are never less precise than a given <b>widening.</b> The framework is then instantiated on the domain of convex polyhedra so as to obtain a new <b>widening</b> operator that improves on the standard <b>widening</b> by combining several heuristics. A preliminary experimental evaluation has yielded promising results. We also suggest an improvement to the well-known <b>widening</b> delay technique that allows one to gain precision while preserving its overall simplicity...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} {{challenges}} facing Higher Education in the United Kingdom, <b>widening</b> participation {{is one of}} the most critical.

In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the <b>Widened</b> Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level.
