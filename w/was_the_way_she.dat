500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped into my head, and I thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, because that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E
500|$|Pierce called Dawn Wells on July 8, 1976, {{to star in}} his film. She {{arrived by}} plane in Texarkana before noon the next day. She stayed in Texarkana for six days, but {{completed}} her scenes in the first two. While filming the cornfield scene, Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog, but the crew scared it away by shooting at it. Wells {{wanted to talk to}} the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress. [...] "They planted a charge in the receiver, so I was standing there holding the phone, shaking, expecting the receiver to blow up in my face." ...|$|E
500|$|Shannon's flashbacks in [...] "Abandoned" [...] {{were used}} to allow the {{audience}} {{to get to a}} [...] "really emotional level with the character, [...] finally understand ... why she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was." [...] Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to [...] "spin Sayid off in another direction." [...] Damon Lindelof commented [...] "It's sort of understood on Lost that that's what you sign up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death." [...] Lindelof felt an [...] "intense, emotional sense of loss" [...] when watching her death. In her post-death appearance in [...] "Collision," [...] Maggie Grace was credited as [...] "special guest star." [...] She received the same billing when she returned in season three, appearing in Nikki and Paulo's flashbacks. Carlton Cuse noted [...] "it was really fun for us to actually have Boone and Shannon reemerge in the stories." [...] Shannon was originally in [...] "LA X", the season premiere for the sixth and final season, but had to be written out as Grace was unavailable. The producers eventually arranged for Grace to appear in [...] "The End".|$|E

60|$|I was humbled, abashed. She {{had seen}} {{me at my}} morning devotions, and this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> {{interpreted}} them.

50|$|In a 2007 interview, {{director}} Britt Allcroft commented <b>the</b> finished film <b>was</b> drastically {{changed from}} what it was originally going to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> had written it, with the original antagonist P.T.

5000|$|Abby Elliott as Brooke Von-Weber, Jill's sister-in-law, {{although}} {{they both have}} a tense relationship because they are tied by their family. She is [...] "the quintessential momzilla"; her husband is a multimillionaire, with whom Brooke raises three children and expecting another one.

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> always called--first five, {{and then}} three. He {{had long since}} noticed it.

Not once had he thought of her in those frenzied hours, and for that much, at least, had she truly been lost to him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{suddenly}} became silent; {{the most painful}} embarrassment showed itself in her face and manner. [...] "Never mind the rest," [...] she said, mastering her confusion after an interval. [...] "I have had some hard trials to bear; I forget things--" [...] she {{made an effort to}} finish the sentence, and gave it up, and called to the dog to come to her. The tears were in her eyes, and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> took to hide them from me.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia remembered {{this speech}} in after-years, {{and more than}} once, wearily closing her eyes, she seemed to see the old woman sitting upright in her faded finery and smiling grimly {{like one of the}} Fates who sees the wheel of fortune turning up her {{favourite}} event. But at the moment it had for her simply the proper gravity of the occasion: this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> supposed, in which lucky young girls were addressed on their engagement by wise old women of quality.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pleasure}} genetically-engineered lifeform (GELF) Camille {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Camille" [...] (1991), and is perceived differently depending on who is looking at her.

6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose they}} have {{anything}} to do with each other. What riled me <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> talked of the shooting. People do when they take a little shooting. They pay some trumpery thirty or forty pounds a year, and then they seem to think that it's almost the same as though they owned the property themselves. I've known a man talk of his manor because he had the shooting of a wood and a small farm round it. They are generally shopkeepers out of London, gin distillers, or brewers, or people like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{soon as he}} {{had said}} it he had himself heard the pity in it.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} elements of Tomos’s writing style <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> uses proper names in her works.
