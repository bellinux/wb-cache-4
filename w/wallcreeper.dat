5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the park, {{including}} Eurasian eagle-owl, rock ptarmigan, alpine accentor, and chough. Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. <b>Wallcreeper</b> are found on steep cliffs. There are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to be {{restricted}} to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which {{has been identified as}} an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, <b>wallcreeper</b> and nuthatches. It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches' closest relatives, {{other than}} the <b>wallcreeper,</b> are the treecreepers, and the two (or three) {{families}} are sometimes placed in a larger grouping with the wrens and gnatcatchers. This superfamily, the Certhioidea, is proposed on phylogenetic studies using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and was created to cover a clade of (four or) five families removed from a larger grouping of passerine birds, the Sylvioidea.|$|E

50|$|Birds {{for which}} the site is {{important}} include saker falcons, solitary snipe, European rollers, Hume's larks, sulphur-bellied warblers, <b>wallcreepers,</b> brown accentors, water pipits, fire-fronted serins, crimson-winged finches, red-mantled rosefinches and white-winged grosbeaks.|$|R
5000|$|Though largely silent, {{both male}} and female <b>wallcreepers</b> sing, the females {{generally}} only while defending feeding territories in the winter. [...] The song is a high-pitched, drawn-out whistle, with notes that alternately rise and fall. [...] During the breeding season, the male sings while perched or climbing.|$|R
5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as <b>wallcreeper</b> Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Anatolian conifer and {{deciduous}} forests is an ecoregion {{which covers}} {{most of the}} Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey, while the Caucasus mixed forests extend across {{the eastern end of}} the range. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, lesser spotted eagle, Caucasian black grouse, red-fronted serin, and <b>wallcreeper.</b> The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Turkish pine is mostly found in Turkey and other east Mediterranean countries. Several wild species of tulip are native to Anatolia, and the flower was first introduced to Western Europe with species taken from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{species in}} the park are 122, of which at least 97 are nesting. Important birds of prey with high {{conservation}} value include the griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, eastern imperial eagle and booted eagle. The park {{is one of the}} two nesting localities in the country of the lanner falcon and the common rosefinch. Rila Monastery Nature Park is an important sanctuary of the hazel grouse, rock partridge, western capercaillie, Eurasian pygmy owl, boreal owl, black woodpecker, white-backed woodpecker, red-breasted flycatcher, <b>wallcreeper,</b> Alpine accentor and Alpine chough. Most of the listed species have at least 5% of their total national population in the territory of the park.|$|E

25|$|Tymfi {{holds the}} largest {{recorded}} population of Balkan chamois deer (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) in Greece, {{with a population}} between 120-130 individuals out of an estimated national population between 477-750. Although chamois is registered as least concern in IUCN's red list, the subspecies balcanica numbers some thousands of individuals and its populations {{are believed to be}} declining. According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species. The Egyptian vulture, short-toed snake eagle, rufous-tailed rock-thrush breed in the region, whereas species such as the golden eagle, red-billed chough, rock partridge, alpine chough, <b>wallcreeper,</b> white-winged snowfinch and the alpine accentor are sedentary. Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|E
500|$|The {{nuthatch}} family, Sittidae, {{was described}} by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828. Sometimes the <b>wallcreeper</b> (Tichodroma muraria), which is restricted to the mountains of southern Eurasia, {{is placed in the}} same family as the nuthatches, but in a separate subfamily [...] "Tichodromadinae", in which case the nuthatches are classified in the subfamily [...] "Sittinae". However, it is more often placed in a separate family, the Tichodromadidae. The <b>wallcreeper</b> is intermediate in its morphology between the nuthatches and the treecreepers, but its appearance, the texture of its plumage, and the shape and pattern of its tail suggest that it is closer to the former taxon. The nuthatch vanga of Madagascar (formerly known as the coral-billed nuthatch) and the sittellas from Australia and New Guinea were once placed in the nuthatch family because of similarities in appearance and lifestyle, but they are not closely related. The resemblances arose via convergent evolution to fill an ecological niche.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, <b>wallcreeper</b> and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and common kestrel, that search for food in a wider zone.|$|E

30|$|Nuthatches, woodpeckers, {{and brown}} creepers are all {{considered}} to be tree-climbing birds. They have claws {{that allow them to}} grip onto bark for insect capture. From these bird species, the Sittidae (the nuthatchers and <b>wallcreepers</b> Sitta and Thrichoma) are the sister group to the Certhiidae (the creepers, Certhia and Salpornis) (Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). Certhia americana and bird species from the Sitta genus are common inhabitants of North American temperate forest. These tree climbers show morphological similarities in their beaks (slender, either straight or decurved) and body size (ranging from 11 to 15 cm of total length). Despite this, they may show pronounced spatial segregation of primary foraging microhabitats in a tree. For example, previous studies have shown that pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) forage higher up in the tree and use their branches more frequently than the trunk (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979). Conversely, white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) forage more often on the trunks (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979), as do brown creepers (C. americana) (Willson 1970). In this context, differences in the use of hunting tactics or substrates to find prey items should facilitate niche differentiation in sympatric tree-climbing birds (Cloyed 2014).|$|R
