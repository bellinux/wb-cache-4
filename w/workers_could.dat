5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars. Todd wrote {{an open letter to}} the city leadership alleging that illegitimate forces from outside the state were behind the events, and that his workers did not truly desire to unionize. He wrote that if his <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E
5|$|To {{members of}} the WFM, {{it became clear that}} {{government}} favored the companies, and only direct action by organized <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> secure the eight-hour day for themselves. When miners in Idaho Springs and Telluride decided to strike for the eight-hour day, they were rounded up at gunpoint by vigilante groups and expelled from their communities. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the law-breaking vigilantes, but they were not acted upon.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} [...] and [...] {{to teach}} that a worker engaged {{by the day}} <b>could</b> collect the <b>worker’s</b> wages all of the following night. If engaged by the night, the <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> collect the wages all of the following day. If engaged by the hour, the <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> collect the wages all that day and night. If engaged by the week, month, year, or 7-year period, if the worker’s time expired during the day, the <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> collect the wages all that day. If the worker’s time expired during the night, the <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> collect the wages all that night and the following day.|$|R

50|$|Employment status - a <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be {{employed}} full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He {{or she could}} {{be employed}} for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time self-employment. The <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be employed also as an apprentice.|$|R
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E
5|$|With {{virtually}} no new work being commissioned, Holden spent {{the war years}} planning for the reconstruction {{that would be required}} once it was over. Holden {{was a member of the}} RIBA's twelve-man committee which formulated the institute's policy for post-war reconstruction. Holden's town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.|$|E

50|$|Civil (legal) status - the <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> {{for example}} {{be a free}} citizen, an indentured labourer, the subject of forced labour (including some prison or army labour); a <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be {{assigned}} by the political authorities to a task, they could be a semi-slave or a serf bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on {{a more or less}} voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.|$|R
2500|$|Before c. 1790 a <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> harvest 1/4 acre per {{day with}} a scythe. [...] In the early 1800s the grain cradle was introduced, {{significantly}} increasing the productivity of hand labor.|$|R
5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens and boys to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> easily be replaced.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} individual {{workers to}} work hard and produce as much as they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E

30|$|But {{the wage}} <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> have {{specialized}} in human capital, {{and so the}} wage will be less than H in both cases, and so the individual would not have chosen to become an entrepreneur.|$|R
50|$|No <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be sacked, unless {{for serious}} {{misconduct}} or incompetence; even in such cases, alternative {{work would be}} offered. The GDR had no system of unemployment benefit because the concept of unemployment did not exist.|$|R
25|$|The early {{rationale}} for craft unionism was that solidarity among diverse workers seemed difficult to obtain, while the AFL believed that skilled <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> more easily get improved conditions for themselves. Thus, craft unions {{have been criticized}} as a labor elite.|$|E
25|$|Other protestors {{noted that}} Misr Helwan <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> launch a general strike, slowing or {{crippling}} the national economy. One worker speaking to Al-Ahram criticized the constitution, stating that article 14 tied wages to production and not food prices. Voting in Mahalla was largely peaceful {{on the day}} of the election.|$|E
25|$|The University of Manchester traces {{its roots}} to the {{formation}} of the Mechanics' Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester's pride in being the world's first industrial city. The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> learn the basic principles of science.|$|E
50|$|A mill <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> {{expect to}} work a thirteen-hour day, {{six days a week}} with two weeks off for the wakes week {{holidays}} in summer. Unsurprisingly, a series of Factory Acts were passed to attempt to ameliorate these conditions.|$|R
25|$|Practically overnight, bridge {{carpenters}} became ironworkers {{during the}} 1880s. It {{was seen as}} a new, exciting job for pioneers in America despite its dangerous drawbacks. For about two dollars per day, a <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> risk his life on high structures.|$|R
25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|R
25|$|In {{the recent}} years, Singapore has been slowly cutting {{down the number}} of foreign workers to {{challenge}} companies to upgrade their hiring criteria and offer more jobs to local residents. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the Singapore policy of {{reducing the number of}} foreign <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> retard the country's economic growth and lower its competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|Many {{supermarkets}} and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing Self checkout systems reducing {{the need for}} employing checkout workers. In the United States, the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 (around 1 in 9 Americans in the workforce). Globally, an estimated 192 million <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> be affected by automation according to research by Eurasia Group.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{resigned}} from the Communist Party on August 24, 1950, and signed the Taft-Hartley oath. However, {{he made it clear}} that he had resigned only so the Fur <b>Workers</b> <b>could</b> receive the protection of federal law. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before the statute of limitations ran out.|$|E
50|$|Harry Bridges, then current {{leader of}} the ILWU, {{designed}} the Mechanization and Modernization Agreement was signed on October 18, 1960. It distinguished between 3 classes of lonsgshoremen workers. Depending {{on the level of}} <b>worker,</b> each <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> guarantee a certain set of benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1905 a semi-governmental agency {{called the}} [...] "Head Office of Farm Workers" [...] {{took up the}} {{engagement}} of workers from outside Germany. Seasonal labour contracts {{to the detriment of}} Polish workers allowed the opportunity for many corrupt practices. The immigrant workers were poorly paid, exploited and - in practicality - totally unprotected. Nevertheless, the influx of candidates was always large and, in the eve of World War I, the number of immigrant workers exceeded 500,000 persons, 80% of them from the struggling Russian-controlled part of Poland. Approximately 200,000 Poles worked in the eastern provinces of Prussia among low living standards and intensive exploitation. A male <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> save 100-150 Marks per year, while a female <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> save 50-100 Marks per year at best.|$|R
50|$|A year later, {{the deteriorating}} war {{situation}} required further restrictions on selections, {{to ensure that}} every able-bodied <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be put {{to work in the}} war economy. On April 27, 1943, Glücks presented a new circular decree with instructions to retire only those prisoners who were mentally ill or disabled.|$|R
25|$|Elton Mayo {{found that}} the social {{contacts}} a worker has at the workplace are very important and that boredom and repetitiveness of tasks lead to reduced motivation. Mayo believed that <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> be motivated by acknowledging their social needs and making them feel important. As a result, employees were given freedom to make decisions {{on the job and}} greater attention was paid to informal work groups.|$|E
25|$|Trout Pond - Park {{visitors}} could rent fishing {{equipment and}} go {{fishing in the}} pond, which was deliberately overstocked {{so it would be}} easy to catch fish. Visitors could fish as much as they wanted and only had to pay for the fish they caught. The Dogpatch restaurant could prepare and serve guests' caught fish, or Dogpatch <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> clean and pack the fish in ice for guests to take home.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 1992, U.S. Labor Secretary Lynn Martin told North Carolina state {{officials}} {{they had a}} deadline of 90 days to improve enforcement of job safety and health regulations or federal agencies would take over. The North Carolina General Assembly passed 14 new worker safety laws as a result, including provision of a system whereby <b>workers</b> <b>could</b> report violations without fear of job loss. The inspector corps was increased from 60 to 114.|$|E

The emergence of Legal Law (Instruksi Presiden No. 9 Tahun 2000) about gender mainstreaming making every stakeholders should integrate gender as perspective in every policy. One {{of efforts to}} protect women worker based on gender perspective could be done by implemented gender mainstreaming. Based on the research, strategy of gender-based protection for women <b>worker</b> <b>could</b> be run through worker union. Every company should have union worker and make contractual worker (PKB).

Therefore every department in Karanganyar should implemented gender mainstreaming so monitoring and evaluation could be done by Department of Labor and Transmigration. This department should be ensure that the contractual worker in every company has a specific protection for women worker...|$|R
50|$|In early shield tunnelling, {{the shield}} {{functioned as a}} way to protect labourers who {{performed}} the digging and moved the shield forward, progressively replacing it with pre-built sections of tunnel wall.
