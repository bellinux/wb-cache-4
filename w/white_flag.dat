5|$|Along the route, if a settler {{needed the}} BX to stop, they simply raised a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> along the {{riverbank}} and the steamer would pull over and land. A <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> was never ignored, it might {{only be a}} settler wanting to ship some produce to market, {{or it could be}} a sick child that needed emergency transportation to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, {{which had been}} recently ordered by the Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of bunting in Brest, Villaret had not been able to distribute this flag to all his ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May, Goebbels {{completed}} his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated {{a letter to}} General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a <b>white</b> <b>flag.</b> Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.|$|E

5|$|Reihl-Kir and Džaja {{concluded}} that a party {{should be sent to}} Borovo Selo, and Šoškoćanin agreed to grant the police safe passage under a <b>white</b> <b>flag.</b> However, when the force of between 20 and 30 policemen entered Borovo Selo under the <b>white</b> <b>flag,</b> they were ambushed by paramilitaries and members of a local militia. Approximately 150 police arrived from Osijek and Vinkovci on buses and were deployed as reinforcements. The force dispatched from Vinkovci entered Borovo Selo and was ambushed, while the reinforcements sent from Osijek via Dalj were stopped at a roadblock north of Borovo Selo and failed to enter the village. A firefight ensued and lasted until 2:30p.m., when seven JNA armoured personnel carriers (APCs) moved into the village from Dalj. Another convoy of APCs deployed by the JNA through Borovo Naselje, just south of Borovo Selo, was stopped by a crowd of Croat women who refused to let them through.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E

50|$|The {{improper}} {{use of the}} flag is forbidden {{by the rules of}} war and constitutes a war crime of perfidy. There have been numerous reported cases of such behavior in conflicts, such as combatants using <b>white</b> <b>flags</b> as a ruse to approach and attack enemy combatants, or killings of combatants attempting to surrender by carrying <b>white</b> <b>flags.</b>|$|R
5|$|Late that evening, a two-coach staff train {{pulled out}} of Brill, {{accompanied}} by a band playing Auld Lang Syne and a <b>white</b> <b>flag.</b> The train stopped at each station along the route, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the tramway to the Metropolitan Railway main line were ceremonially severed.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa was now {{convinced}} that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully, {{and he began}} to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch'ich' the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> from a safe distance.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities {{can also}} adopt flags of their own. The designs {{of the city}} flags {{are similar to the}} prefectural flags: a mon on a monocolored background. An example is the flag of Amakusa in Kumamoto Prefecture: the city symbol is {{composed}} of the Katakana character ア (a) and surrounded by waves. This symbol is centered on a <b>white</b> <b>flag,</b> with a ratio of 2:3. Both the city emblem and the flag were adopted in 2006.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March {{a number}} of Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Ch'ich' to {{negotiate}} with Ursúa. Kan Ek' then sent a canoe with a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> raised bearing emissaries, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March, Itza and Yalain emissaries {{arrived at}} Ch'ich' to {{negotiate}} with Ursúa. First came AjChan who had already met him in Mérida; he was followed by Chamach Xulu, the ruler of the Yalain. Kan Ek' then sent a canoe with a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors massed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the only option was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told to wave a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> at the militia.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{their leader}} fall, the Loyalists began to surrender. Some Patriots {{did not want}} to take prisoners, as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or 'Tarleton's Quarter,' in which Banastre Tarleton's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford's Continental {{soldiers}} after the latter tried to surrender. (At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> of surrender.) Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby {{called for}} volunteers {{to serve in}} the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was {{commissioned}} as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> {{in the midst of the}} British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1831, {{the papal}} {{infantry}} flew square yellow and <b>white</b> <b>flags.</b> At first they were diagonally divided, but after 1849 they were vertically divided like the merchant flag.

5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were allowed to leave the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel García Moreno, upon {{assuming}} power {{two days}} after the Battle of Guayaquil in September 1860, the yellow, blue and red triband was returned to use; its reinstatement on September 26 is commemorated during Ecuador's national flag day. Previously, a vertical white, blue and <b>white</b> <b>flag</b> was used. In the middle of the blue stripe, there were white stars placed to signify the number of provinces in Ecuador. The highest star total was seven before this flag was abandoned. In 1900, the flag was made the definitive national standard, and was charged with the coat of arms for official national government use while the plain flag was reserved for the merchant marine.|$|E
