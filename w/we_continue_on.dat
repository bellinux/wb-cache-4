For that reason we shuffle over them shame-faced and apologetic, making {{arrangements}} here and flagrant compromises there, in order to give substance to the lie that we have dropped fortuitously into this high seat and are looking round the world for some one to resign it to. Nor is it any lie that, had we used the Navy's bare fist instead of its gloved hand from the beginning, we could in all likelihood have shortened the war. That being so, we elected to dab and peck at and half-strangle the enemy, to let him go and choke him again. It is no lie that <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>on</b> our inexplicable path animated, we will try to believe till other proof is given, by a cloudy idea of alleviating or mitigating something for somebody--not ourselves. [Here, of course, is where our racial snobbery comes in, which makes the German gibber. I cannot understand why he has not accused us to our Allies of having secret commercial understandings with him.] For that reason, we shall finish the German eagle as the merciful lady killed the chicken. It took her the whole afternoon, and then, you will remember, the carcase had to be thrown away.|$|E

Persson elaborated on the theme and story behind the final moments of the album, stating: [...] "What we were trying to put across in those last few minutes was the sound of us penetrating the outer-outer limits of space. ...

We provide different types of families of self-similar copulas using techniques from Probability and Ergodic Theory to give properties on subsets of their fractal supports. In particular, we give new examples for those copulas and we analyze related topics with mutual singularity of the associated measures, Hausdorff dimension, and the connectedness of their supports...|$|E

The streets are broad and of a uniform height of twenty feet. At intervals tubes pierce the roof of this underground city, and by means of lenses and reflectors transmit the sunlight, softened and diffused, to dispel what would otherwise be Cimmerian darkness.

The research combines state-of-the-art climate science projections through the year 2100 (and beyond in some cases) with empirically-derived estimates of the impact of projected changes in temperature and precipitation on the Midwest economy. The authors analyze not only those outcomes most likely to occur, but also lower-probability, higher-cost climate futures. These are the "tail risks," most often expressed here as the 1 -in- 20 chance something will occur. Unlike any other study to date, this report looks at climate impacts at a very geographically granular level, in some cases providing county-level results...|$|E
