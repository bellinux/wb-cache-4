500|$|Her verse in Kanye West's [...] "Monster" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics {{said she had}} the best verse in the song. Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. She has her own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> She has an ill [...] vocal delivery.

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but discarded it. They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it we {{seemed to be going}} down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song. It's simply trying to find a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E
500|$|Hundreds {{of musicians}} have been {{inspired}} by the album. Pianist Lafayette Gilchrist states that Money Jungle was the first jazz album that he bought, and that it [...] "sounds like an orchestra being played by a trio. I was inspired to make something [...] big and grandiose just like that". Drummer Jeff [...] "Tain" [...] Watts observed that the members of the trio were [...] "doing their thing, but they’re together", and compares this with later groups led by Keith Jarrett and Wayne Shorter, stating that the later groups [...] "have a much freer <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> but everybody's kind of in their own zone and yet they’re [...] definitely [...] playing [...] the [...] composition in tune with each other, just like Duke and Max and Mingus were doing on Money Jungle." [...] Trumpeter Miles Davis had a different view of the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test, he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that [...] "Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke." ...|$|E

Nonetheless, in 2015 he said: [...] "Really I just enjoy writing words {{sitting at a}} piano. I tend to lose interest in the drum machine." [...] Unlike Greenwood, Yorke does not read sheet music, feeling [...] "you can't express the rhythms properly like that.

[...] Explaining why he turned down a request to play piano on the track [...] "Mr. Bellamy" [...] on Paul McCartney's album Memory Almost Full (2007), Yorke said: [...] "The piano playing involved two hands doing things separately. I don’t have that skill available. I said to him, 'I strum piano, that's it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After the University of Sydney's Institute for Democracy and Human Rights {{organized}} a 2013 talk by the Dalai Lama, the university warned {{that they could}} not use its logo, allow media coverage, or permit entry to the event by Tibet activists—forcing organizers to move the event off campus. University officials decided, [...] "there was a better <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> A small group, a small section of the student body, was really not the best thing." [...] Sarah Hanson-Young, an Australian Greens senator, said [...] "As a democratic country, we should be encouraging more open and frank discussion about the current situation in Tibet, not banning the country's spiritual leader from addressing students and staff at universities." [...] A spokesperson for the activist Australia Tibet Council said the university had given in to China. [...] "They have compromised their academic freedom and integrity, and it also sends a disheartening message to the Tibetan people," [...] more than 100 of whom have died in recent self-immolation protests. June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami (Florida) professor of political science, claims that Confucius Institutes have distorted history, citing universities in Australia inviting speakers [...] "to shill for the government and talk about how happy all the Tibetans were".
