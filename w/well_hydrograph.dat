The model was measured under steady and transient conditions. The structural distribution of groundwater head and <b>well</b> <b>hydrograph</b> was differentiated from the historic data. They achieved that rapid urbanization would lead to further lowering of the water table at few locations along the Northern coast of the aquifer system. They also indicated that their model is delicate even for 5 % reduction in recharge (Gnanasundar and Elango 2011). Gogu et al. (2001) performed groundwater modeling of Belgium for the Walloon region by using the GIS-based hydrogeological database. Different hydrogeological characteristics of five river pool were chosen in the database. A “loose-coupling” device was estimated between the groundwater numerical model interface Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) and the structural-data base plan. Stored data in the database of hydrogeological data can be used easily for structural queries and following time within different groundwater numerical models (Wojda et al. 2006).|$|E
30|$|In Peninsular India, all {{the hard}} rock true hydrographs show a {{predominant}} annual cycle {{in response to the}} wet and dry season. With the onset of monsoon, throughout the monsoon the curve form rising limb and once the monsoon retrieve the curve starts forming recession limb, which continue until the next monsoon (annual cycle). Successive annual cycles join together to form long-term hydrograph. With the full knowledge of fluctuation of groundwater level, the hydraulic conductivity/filtration conditions can be calculated by analyzing recession curve of <b>well</b> <b>hydrograph</b> (Ferdowsian et al. 2001; Gailuma and Vitola 2009; Posavec et al. 2006; Sujono et al. 2004). The rapid decline in recession curve corresponds to better filtration conditions (Gailuma and Vitola 2009). Therefore, it can be stated comparatively that the U shape curves correspond to better hydraulic conductivity (k) than the V shape, whereas the S shape curves represents the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. So, based on hydraulic conductivity (k) aquifers can be classified as U > V > S type curve. In the Peninsular hard rock V type is more abundant over U type, while S type is the least abundant type since it largely corresponds to aquicludes.|$|E

The field {{lies in a}} sand plain setting in central Minnesota and is cropped continuously in field corn. The sites are located at a topographically high (upland) site and a topographically low (lowland) site {{in an effort to}} quantify the effects of depression focusing of recharge. Three site-specific methods were used to estimate recharge rates: <b>well</b> <b>hydrograph</b> analysis, chlorofluorocarbon age dating, and an unsaturated zone water balance. All three recharge methods indicated that recharge rates at the lowland site (annual average of all methods of 29 cm) exceeded those at the upland site (annual average of 18 cm). On an annual basis, estimates by the individual methods ranged from 12 to 44 percent of precipitation at the upland site and from 21 to 83 percent at the lowland site. The difference in recharge rates between the sites is primarily attributed to depression focusing of surface water run-on at the lowland site. However, two other factors were also important: the presence of thin lamellae at the upland site, and coarser textured soils below a depth of 1. 5 m at the lowland site...|$|E

40|$|Riparian {{zones in}} {{semi-arid}} regions often exhibit {{high rates of}} evapotranspiration (ET) in spite of low soil moisture content due to vegetation that is able to withdraw water from shallow aquifers. This work better defines the relationship between ET and the saturated zone by comparing the observed water table drawdown to analytically modeled drawdown in fully penetrating wells of an unconfined aquifer in response to daily ET flux. ET at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site or BHRS (a riparian zone in a temperate, semi arid environment) is calculated following the approach of Batra et al. (2006) but uses site (or near site) measurements for air temperature and net radiation while relying on Landsat 5 data for quantification of vegetation. The resulting ET calculations represent a data set consisting of high resolution (30 m x 30 m) ET flux values obtained from minimal site measurements. Water table levels in the shallow, unconfined aquifer were monitored over {{the summer and fall}} of 2009 to record the timing and magnitude of daily fluctuations in four wells with different vegetation densities and distances from the nearby Boise River at the site. ET derived from the radiation-driven model of Batra et al. (2006) compares favorably with groundwater ET contribution rates calculated from <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> (White, 1932), which further supports the finding of negligible water contribution coming from the unsaturated zone in shallow riparian aquifers in semi-arid regions (Shah et al., 2007). Using an analytical solution to ET induced drawdown (Malama 2 ̆ 6 Johnson, 2010) for a semi-infinite (or river bounded) domain, daily drawdown is modeled in response to daily ET flux applied at the water table. Close agreement between observed and modeled drawdown supports the idea that ET can be estimated from <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> in a wellcharacterized aquifer and conversely, if ET behavior is characterized, aquifer parameters like hydraulic conductivity and specific storage can be estimated from <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Riparian {{zones in}} {{semiarid}} regions often exhibit {{high rates of}} evapotranspiration (ET) in spite of low-soil moisture content due {{to the presence of}} phreatophytic vegetation that is able to withdraw water from shallow aquifers. This work seeks to better define the relationship between ET, the saturated zone and the river boundary by comparing observed water table drawdown records to analytically modeled drawdown in fully penetrating wells of an unconfined aquifer in response to daily ET flux. ET at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), a riparian zone in a temperate, semiarid environment, is calculated using a radiation-based method to provide ET values at four different wells with different vegetation densities. Analytically modeled drawdown response to ET forcing shows that drawdown magnitude increases with increasing distance from the river edge even as the surficial ET forcing remains constant. This behavior is also observed in <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> and shows the buffering effect that flow from the river has on drawdown in fully penetrating riparian wells in highly permeable, unconfined aquifers. Relative contributions of river water to aquifer storage are calculated for ET-induced diurnal fluctuations of the water table at increasing distances from the river boundary. Failure to account for these spatial differences in drawdown related to the river source may explain some errors associated with estimating ET from <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> alone...|$|R

The data obtained from <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> provide water level versus time; hence, a method of hydrograph analysis is required for situations in which only water level data are available. It is hypothesized here that three segments on a recession curve from wells in a karst aquifer represent drainage from three types of storage: conduit (C), fracture (F), and matrix (M). <b>Hydrographs</b> from several <b>wells</b> in a karst aquifer at the U.

Data from three short injection tests at one well indicate continuum T at this well bore is {approximately} 5 m{sup 2 }/d, and tests at numerous other wells in the aquifer yield results between 1 and 7 M{sup 2 }/d. The T estimated with <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> from two storm events indicates a T of 9. 8 m{sup 2 } 2 /d. Well developed conduit systems in which water levels in wells show a flashy response typically show S{sub y} values of 1 {times} 10 {sup - 4 }, 1 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }, and 3 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }, for C, F, and M. Less well developed conduit areas show more nearly equal S{sub y} values (8. 6 {times} 10 {sup - 4 }, 1. 3 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }, 3 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }). Areas with no evidence {{for the presence of}} conduits have only one, or in some cases two, slopes on the recession curve. In these cases, water level responses are slow. Recession curves with a single slope represent drainage from only the lower T matrix.

Assuming infiltration losses are a function of stream discharge and using empirical equations developed by the U. S.

Estimates of recharge were obtained by two indirect methods: (1) A deconvolution integral in which the impulse response function is derived from the one-dimensional diffusion equation and the output functions are based on <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs.</b> The recharge values ranged between 1. 41 x 10 ⁶ m³/km and 2. 07 x 10 ⁶ m³/km depending on values of aquifer diffusivity obtained from the literature (al = 6, 000 m²/day and (α₂ = 3, 000 m²/day). (2) A groundwater mound method gave a recharge value ranging between 0. 86 x 10 ⁶ m³/km and 1. 29 x 10 ⁶ m³/km depending on the effective porosity values (0. 10, 0. 15).

The analysis relies on Theis' or Jacob's approximate solution, which assumes aquifer homogeneity. Aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at different scales. If the observation well taps into a low permeability zone while the pumping well {{is located in}} a high permeable zone, the resulting situation contradicts the homogeneity assumption embedded in the traditional analysis. As a result, a practical but important question we ask: What do we derive from the traditional analysis? Using numerical experiments in synthetic aquifers, we answer this question. Results of the experiments indicate that the effective transmissivity, Teff, and storage coefficient, Seff, values vary with time, as well as the principal directions of the transmissivity, but both values approach their geometric means of the aquifer at large times. Analysis of the estimated transmissivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) using <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> from a single observation well shows that at early times, both the estimated T and S values vary with time. At late times, both estimates approach local averages near the observation well.

30|$|The aquifer {{response}} to recharge–discharge phenomenon of hard rock aquifers {{has been investigated}} by analyzing over 250 <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> collected from eight States of Peninsular India. The true hydrographs are based on continuous (six hourly) time series data recorded {{with the help of}} digital automatic water level recorders fitted in purpose-built piezometers. Due to the high heterogeneity of hard rock aquifers each well/piezometer produces a hydrograph that is unique and does not match with <b>hydrographs</b> of other <b>wells.</b> However, the successive annual curves of the <b>hydrograph</b> of a <b>well</b> remain nearly similar in shape though the magnitude of fluctuation varies based on the quantum of recharge–discharge and its pattern. This clearly reflects that the shape of the hydrograph is controlled by aquifer characteristic and its response and does not entirely depend on recharge–discharge quantum and pattern. The combination of rising and recession limbs produces different crest and trough shapes. Similarity in crest and trough shape represents similarity in aquifer characteristics. As found during this research shapes of the crests and troughs of the true hydrographs can form a basis for devising a genetic classification of the aquifers. Three crest types namely ‘point’, ‘rounded’ and ‘flat top’ crest and three trough types viz. V shape, U shape and S shape have been identified in hard rocks of Peninsular India. The V type curve indicates quick dissipation; U type indicates initial quick adjustment and then slow dissemination whereas the S type curves are indicative of poor response of the aquifer. The U shape indicates relatively better sustained diffusivity of the aquifers. Confined and unconfined aquifers can be differentiated based on the apparent line thickness. Thin line denotes unconfined and thick line denotes confined aquifer. Intermittent apparent thickness of line corresponds to semi-confined aquifer. Fluctuation produced by pumping of well can be segregated based on the fluctuation pattern.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{monitoring}} of groundwater levels {{is important for}} the management of groundwater resources. Within the United Kingdom a selection of observation boreholes are monitored for periodic assessment of the groundwater resources. The measurement of groundwater levels is undertaken principally by the water companies, the National Rivers Authority (NRA) for England and Wales, the River Purification Boards (RPB) for Scotland and the Department of the Environment (DOE) for Northern Ireland. Weekly and monthly data are supplied to the British Geological Survey (BGS) and these data are entered into an ORACLE database where they are assimulated with historical records. Additionally, paper copies are archived. Data usage is facilitated by a number of computer retrievals including <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> in graphic form. Access to the groundwater level information is made available to the public at a small operational cost. A number of publications are produced giving a review on groundwater, including an assessment ofrecharge to major aquifers and also a number of hydrographs are illustrated from the key boreholes. The database has proved to be an invaluable tool in predicting environmental change, such asdroughts and rising groundwater levels. Groundwater has been an important source of water supply for many centuries and now constitutes about 35 % of the supply of England and Wales. The reliability of groundwater sup-plies and the contribution of groundwater base-flow to river flows and the aquatic environment was thrown into sharp focus during the 1988 - 1992 drought. The drought severely affected the English lowlands and by the summer of I 992 groundwater storage throughout England and Wales was at its lowest his century (Marsh et al. 1994).

30|$|Recharge {{has been}} defined as “the entry into the {{saturated}} zone of water made available at the water-table surface, together with the associated flow away from the water table within the saturated zone” (Freeze and Cherry 1979). The manner in which infiltrating water is transmitted through the system controls system response to recharge. If the rate of recharge were constant and equal to the rate of drainage away from the water table, water levels would not change. For unconfined aquifers, a time lag occurs during which the pressure change in the land surface is propagated through the unsaturated zone to the water table. Air must move through the unsaturated zone to transmit a pressure change. Therefore, an imbalance exists between the pressure on the water in the well and the water in the aquifer until the pressure front arrives at the water table. This imbalance produces a change in the observed water level in the well. Weeks (1979) and Rojstaczer (1988) present in-depth analyses of this phenomenon. The length of the time lag increases with increasing depth to the water table and with decreasing vertical air diffusivity of the unsaturated zone sediments. The barometric efficiency of an unconfined aquifer is not constant, because these two factors can change over time. Techniques for identifying and removing the effects of atmospheric-pressure changes from observed water levels are described in Weeks (1979) and Rasmussen and Crawford (1997). Pressure transducers are often used to monitor water levels; these devices can be affected by atmospheric pressure changes. Non-vented or absolute, transducer readings may reflect atmospheric-pressure changes and could give the false impression that water-level fluctuations are much greater in magnitude than they are in reality. However, all the above-discussed deviations are not significant {{in the context of the}} present paper. <b>Well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> have been classified earlier based on its segment slope and are used to compute recharge, specific storage and time lag (Raj 2004). The shape of crest and trough and therefore the shape of the annual cycle is the product of aquifer character, recharge and discharge quantum and its pattern and have been utilized in this study as a tool to arrive in for genetic classification of hard rock aquifer (see the supplementary sheets- 1 & 2).|$|R
40|$|A tomographic survey {{provides}} different coverages {{and perspectives}} on subsurface heterogeneity [...] incompletely overlapping {{information about the}} subsurface. Fusion of these pieces of information expands and enhances the capability of a conventional survey, provides cross-validation, and constrains inherently ill-posed field-scale inverse problems. In this study, we explore {{the possibility of using}} river stage variation for basin-scale subsurface tomographic surveys. Basin-scale tomography requires energy sources of great strengths; spatially and temporally varying natural stimuli are ideal energy sources for this purpose. Specifically, we use numerical models to simulate groundwater level changes in response to temporal and spatial variations of river stage in a hypothetical groundwater basin. We then exploit the relation between temporal and spatial variations of <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs</b> and river stage to image the heterogeneous characteristics of the basin. Next, we apply the hydraulic tomography testing technique and analysis algorithm to synthetic fractured media. The application aims to explore the potential utility of the technique and the algorithm for characterizing fracture zone distribution and their connectivity. Results of this investigation show that using hydraulic tomography with a limited number of wells can map satisfactorily the fracture zone distribution and the general pattern of its connectivity although estimated hydraulic property fields are smooth. As the number of wells and monitoring ports increases, the fracture zone distribution and connectivity becomes more vivid and the estimated hydraulic properties approach the true values. Further we develop a new parameter identification method that allows for simultaneous inclusion of all observed hydrographs from hydraulic tomography to map aquifer heterogeneity. A procedure is then recommended to diagnose and denoise observed hydrographs. Subsequently, we introduce methods that exploit these processed hydrographs for estimating effective parameters, boundary conditions, and statistical spatial structures of heterogeneity, which are the required inputs for the new hydraulic tomography analysis method. This new method and the data processing procedure are tested in a synthetic aquifer and subsequently applied to a sand box experiment. The estimated parameter fields for the sand box experiment are validated by predicting the head distribution induced by an independent pumping test, which was not used in the hydraulic tomography analysis...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{hydraulic}} tomography (THT) is {{a cost-effective}} technique for characterizing {{the heterogeneity of}} hydraulic parameters in the subsurface. In this study we developed an efficient sequential successive linear estimator (SSLE) for interpreting head data from transient hydraulic tomography to estimate three dimensional hydraulic conductivity and specific storage fields. We first analyzed the cross correlation between transient head data and hydraulic parameters and covariance of transient heads using a hypothetical one dimensional aquifer. This analysis led to {{an efficient way to}} interpret transient heads. The SSLE was then tested using a well-posed problem and an ill-posed problem. To affirm the robustness of our approach, we applied transient hydraulic tomography to a hypothetical three-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer. Our SSLE approach involves solving adjoint equations during the sensitivity analysis for transient flow, which creates greater computational cost than steady state hydraulic tomography. To reduce the computational cost, we developed an estimation approach that utilizes the zeroth and first temporal moments of <b>well</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> instead of drawdown itself. The governing equations and adjoint equations for the temporal moments are Poisson's equations. These equations demand less computational resources as opposed to the parabolic equation that governs drawdown evolution. Therefore, a temporal moment approach is expected to expedite the interpretation of THT surveys. Based on this premise, we extended our sequential successive linear estimator (SSLE) to use the zeroth moment and characteristic time of the drawdown-recovery data generated by THT surveys. We subsequently investigated computational efficiency and accuracy of the moment approach using a synthetic aquifer. We further extended the hydraulic tomography concept to tracer tomography for characterizing NAPL (Non-aqueous phase liquid) source zones. Similar to a hydraulic tomographic survey, a tracer tomography survey sequentially injects tracers at a selected well and monitors tracer breakthroughs at other wells in a NAPL source zone to detect the distribution of NAPL's. To quantitatively interpret the breakthroughs from the tracer tomography, a joint stochastic estimation technique was developed. The method is an extension of the SSLE used for interpreting hydraulic tomography surveys. The technology was tested and investigated using a synthetic aquifer contaminated with a single component NAPL...|$|R

The CRBG groundwater system in Mosier has experienced groundwater declines of up to 60 meters due to over-pumping and or commingling. Declining groundwater levels have led to concerns over the sustainability of the resource, {{as it is the}} principle water source for irrigation and domestic use. Despite numerous previous studies of groundwater flow in CRBG aquifers here and elsewhere in the Columbia River basin, an aspect that has received relatively little attention is the interaction between groundwater and surface waters at locations where interflow zones are intersected by the surface waters.

The results of the general chemistry and isotope data reveal a more evolved chemical signature in lower watershed groundwater versus a less evolved signature for waters from wells located higher up on the Columbia Hills anticline. This was interpreted {{to be the result of}} the major structural features in the area providing for a more regional pathway of recharge in lower watershed groundwaters, versus a more local source of recharge for upper watershed groundwaters. There was also a pronounced commingled signature in the elemental ratios of lower watershed aquifer waters. The suspected mechanism of recharge to lower watershed wells is through younger Cascadian deposits upslope from the local watershed. The findings of this study reveal the importance of a detailed understanding of CRBG stratigraphy and its relation to surface waters, especially for other areas within the Yakima Fold Belt or Oregon and Washington. Studies that do not consider the influence that individual CRBG flows can have on groundwater-surface water interactions, and the groundwater system as a whole, run the risk of improperly assessing the groundwater resource for a region...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the suitability of the daily time step physical-conceptual ACRU model for hydrological modelling in the Bonsa catchment. Since the catchment is data poor, model calibration was conducted using a careful parameterization and sensitivity analysis, using initial values obtained from literature and field observations, as well as climate data for the period 1987 – 1999 and 1991 land use. The model performance during calibration and validation was satisfactory, with a monthly NSE of 0. 6 and 0. 5 and R 2 of 0. 8 and 0. 7, respectively. The model simulated the rise and the recession of the <b>hydrograph</b> <b>well,</b> but during the validation the accumulated monthly streamflows were underestimated by 10 %. The main conclusion from this study is that the ACRU hydrological model is suitable for exploring basic hydrological responses to land use and climate in the Bonsa and similar catchments...|$|R
40|$|Storage routing {{models are}} {{becoming}} more widely accepted for flood hydrograph synthesis. The network models represent a considerable advance in this direction even though these models are based on many assumptions and empirical relationships. Watershed Bounded Network Model (WBNM) is one such model. This model maintains a good relationship between the hydrological and geomorphological properties of a watershed and is capable of accurate flood hydrograph synthesis. The model can account for the non-uniform distribution of rainfall over the watershed. Lag is a dominant factor to be known for the successful application of WBNM. In this paper the theoretical basis of WBNM and its application to Pageru watershed in southern India is presented. The watershed contains three well spread rain gauges. Isolated flood events from a four years record were considered for the calibration of the model. Validation of the model revealed that the predicted <b>hydrographs</b> are compared <b>well</b> with observed <b>hydrographs</b> for the given rainfall excess hyetographs. Therefore, with its sound geomorphological basis, Watershed Bounded Network Model has a valid and versatile application {{over a wide range}} of conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, new {{approaches}} were adopted to manage stormwater {{as close to}} its source as possible through technologies and devices that preserve and recreate natural landscape features. Green Roofs (GR) are examples of these devices that are also incentivized by city's stormwater management plans. Several studies show that GR decreases on-site runoff from impervious surfaces, however, {{the analysis of the}} effect of widespread implementation of GR in the flood characteristics at the urban basin scale in subtropical areas are little discussed, mainly because of the absence of data. Thereby, this paper shows results related to the monitoring of an extensive modular GR under subtropical weather conditions, the development of a rainfall–runoff model based on the modified Curve Number (CN) and SCS Triangular Unit Hydrograph (TUH) methods and the analysis of large-scale impact of GR by modelling different basins. The model was calibrated against observed data and showed that GR absorbed almost all the smaller storms and reduced runoff even during the most intense rainfall. The overall CN was estimated in 83 (consistent with available literature) with the shape of <b>hydrographs</b> <b>well</b> reproduced. Large-scale modelling (in basins ranging from 0. 03 ha to several square kilometers) showed that the widespread use of GRs reduced peak flows (volumes) around 57...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{suitability}} of a single hillslope as a parsimonious representation of a catchment in a physically based model. We test this hypothesis by picturing two distinctly different catchments in perceptual models and translating these pictures into parametric setups of 2 -D physically based hillslope models. The model parametrizations {{are based on a}} comprehensive field data set, expert knowledge and process-based reasoning. Evaluation against streamflow data highlights that both models predicted the annual pattern of streamflow generation as <b>well</b> as the <b>hydrographs</b> acceptably. However, a look beyond performance measures revealed deficiencies in streamflow simulations during the summer season and during individual rainfall–runoff events as well as a mismatch between observed and simulated soil water dynamics. Some of these shortcomings can be related to our perception of the systems and to the chosen hydrological model, while others point to limitations of the representative hillslope concept itself. Nevertheless, our results confirm that representative hillslope models are a suitable tool to assess the importance of different data sources as well as to challenge our perception of the dominant hydrological processes we want to represent therein. Consequently, these models are a promising step forward in the search for the optimal representation of catchments in physically based models...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to conduct laboratory experiment for the generation of rainfall runoff data using rainfall simulator. For the validation this observed data, a model is establish for estimating observed runoff data using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. Methods: A total 12 laboratory experiments were conducted using rainfall simulator to generate runoff hydrograph using various slope and rainfall intensity over the catchment. For the validation of observed runoff hydrograph data were simulate using ANN. The ANN model was developed using collected 1076 data point to compute runoff discharge. For developing ANN model, the available data were separated as 70 % for training, 15 % for testing and 15 % for validation. Results: The predicted results using ANN model performed better estimation with observed values which is useful for water resources planning and management etc. For the testing of model performance Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criteria were used which gives NSE greater than 95 %. Conclusion: The comparison of observed and predicted runoff hydrograph reveals that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predicts the runoff data reasonably <b>well</b> in observed <b>hydrograph.</b> It is found that ANNs are promising tools not only in accurate modeling of complex processes but also in providing insight from the learned relationship, which would assist the modeler in understanding of the process under investigation as well as in evaluation of the model. *Author for correspondenc...|$|R
40|$|Hydrograph recessions from {{rainfall}} {{events have}} previously been analyzed for discharge at springs and streams; however, relatively little quantitative {{research has been}} conducted with regard to hydrograph analysis of recessions from monitoring wells screened in karst aquifers. In previous work a quantitative hydrography analysis technique has been proposed born which matrix transmissivity (i. e., transmissivity of intergranular porosity) and specific yields of matrix, fracture, and conduit components of the aquifer may be determined from well hydrography. The technique has yielded realistic results at three sites tested by the authors thus far (Y- 12, Oak Ridge, TN; Crane, IN, and Ft. Campbell, KY). Observed field data, as well as theoretical considerations, show that karst well hydrography are valid indicators of hydraulic properties of the associated karst aquifers. Results show matrix transmissivity (T) values to be in good agreement with values calculated using more traditional parameter estimation techniques such as aquifer pumping tests and slug tests in matrix dominated <b>wells.</b> While the <b>hydrograph</b> analysis technique shows promise for obtaining reliable estimates of karst aquifer T with a simple, relatively inexpensive and passive method, the utility of the technique is limited in its application depending on site-specific hydrologic conditions, which include shallow, submerged conduit systems located in areas with sufficient rainfall for water levels to respond to precipitation events...|$|R
40|$|The Runoff Model Based on Cellular Automata (RunCA) {{has been}} {{developed}} to simulate surface runoff at different scales by integrating basic cellular automata (CA) rules with fundamental measureable hydraulic properties. In this model, a two-dimensional lattice composed {{of a series of}} rectangular cells was employed to cover the study area. Runoff production within each cell was simulated by determining the cell state (height) that consists of both cell elevation and water depth. The distribution of water flow among cells was determined by applying CA transition rules based on the minimization-of-difference algorithm and the calculated spatially varied flow velocities. RunCA was verified and validated by three steps. Good agreement with the analytical solution was achieved under simplified conditions in the first step. Then, results from runoff experiments on small laboratory plots (2 m × 1 m) showed that the model was able to <b>well</b> predict the <b>hydrographs,</b> with the mean Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0. 90. RunCA was also applied to a large scale site (Pine Glen Basin, USA) with data taken from literature. The predicted <b>hydrograph</b> agreed <b>well</b> with the measured results. Simulated flow maps in this basin also demonstrated the model capability in capturing both the spatial and temporal variations in the runoff process. Model sensitivity analysis results showed that the calculated total runoff and total infiltration were most sensitive to the input parameters representing the final steady infiltration rate at both scales. The Manning’s roughness coefficient and the setting of cell size did not affect the results much at the small plot scale, but had large influences at the large basin scale...|$|R

These changes had significant impacts on the water resources in the area. Insights into groundwater and surface water interactions and vegetation-water dependencies help to understand these impacts and formulate sustainable water resources management policies. In this study, groundwater and surface water interactions were identified using the baseflow index at the catchment scale, and hydraulic and temperature methods as <b>well</b> as event <b>hydrograph</b> separation techniques at the sub-catchment scale. The results show that almost 88 % of the river discharge consists of groundwater. Vegetation dependencies on groundwater were analyzed from the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and groundwater depth at the catchment scale and along an ecohydrogeological cross-section, and by measuring the sap flow of different plants, soil water contents and groundwater levels at different research sites. The results show that all vegetation types, i. e. trees (willow (Salix matsudana) and poplar (Populus simonii)), bushes (salix (Salix psammophila)) and agricultural crops (maize (Zea mays)), depend on groundwater as the dominant water source for transpiration. The comparative analysis indicates that maize crops use the largest amount of water, followed by poplar trees, salix bushes, and willow trees. For sustainable water use with the objective of satisfying water demand for socio-economical development and to prevent desertification, more water use efficient crops such as sorghum, barley and millet should be promoted to reduce the consumptive water use for irrigation. Willow trees should be used as wind-breaks in croplands and along roads, and dry resistant and less water use intensive plants (for instance native bushes) should be used to vegetate sand dunes...|$|R

40|$|Establishing a clear {{overview}} of data discharge availability for water balance modelling in basins {{is a priority}} in Europe, and in the particular {{in the framework of}} the system of Economic and Environmental Accounts for Water (SEEAW) developed by the EU Directorate-General for the Environment. However, accurate discharge estimation at a river site depends on rating curve reliability usually defined by recording the water level at a gauged section and carrying out streamflow measurements. Local stage monitoring is fairly straightforward and relatively inexpensive compared to the cost to carry out flow velocity measurements which are, in addition, hindered by high flow. Moreover, hydraulic models may not be ideally suitable to serve the purpose of rating curve extension or its development at a river site upstream/downstream where the discharge is known due to their prohibitive requirement of channel cross-section details and roughness information at closer intervals. Likewise, rainfall-runoff transformation might be applied but its accuracy is tightly linked to detailed information in terms of geomorphological characteristics of intermediate basins as well as rainfall pattern data. On this basis, a procedure for reverse flood routing in natural channels is here proposed for three different configurations of hydrometric monitoring of a river reach where lateral flow is significant and no rainfall data are available for the intermediate basin. The first considers only the downstream channel end as a gauged site where discharge and stages are recorded. The second configuration assumes the downstream end as a gauged site but only in terms of stage. The third configuration envisages both channel ends equipped to recording stages. The channel geometry is known only at channel ends. The developed model has basically four components: (1) the inflow hydrograph is expressed by a Pearson Type-III distribution, involving parameters of peak discharge, time to peak, and a shape factor; (2) the basic continuity equation for flow routing written in the characteristic form is employed; (3) the lateral flow is related to stages at channel ends. (4) the relation between local stage and remote discharge as found by Moramarco et al. (2005 b) is exploited. The parameters, coefficients and exponents of the model are obtained, for each configuration, using the genetic algorithm method. Three equipped river branches along the Tiber River in central Italy are used to validate the procedure. Analyses are carried out for three significant flood events occurred along the river and where the lateral flow was significant. Results show the good performance of the procedure for all three monitoring configurations. Specifically, the discharge hydrographs assessed at channel ends are found satisfactory both in terms of shape with a Nash-Sutcliffe ranging overall in the interval (0. 755 – 0. 972) and in the reproduction of rating curves at channel ends. Finally, by a synthetic test the performance of the developed procedure is compared to that of the hydraulic model coupled with a hydrologic model. Two river reaches are considered, the first along the Tiber River and the second one located in the Rio Grande basin which is a tributary of the Tiber River. Detailed channel geometry data are available for both the river sections.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{was developed}} to conduct diagnostic performance assessment and simulation of alternative delivery scenarios in pressurized irrigation distribution networks. It consists of three components, an agro-hydrologic model able to forecast peak water demand hydrographs, a hydraulic model with capability of simulating the network behavior under different flow configurations, {{and a set of}} performance indicators for conducting assessments of performance achievements relative to specified targets. As a preliminary work, the current delivery schedule of an existing pressurized irrigation network (system 1) and the resulting effects on crop irrigation management were analyzed by simulating soil water balance and irrigation scheduling at field level. Simulations allowed analyzing the on-farm irrigation management under the current rotation deliveries, and comparing it with an alternative flexible irrigation scheduling to maximize crop yields. Results at field level were up-scaled to the entire command area of the system, showing the usefulness of soil water balance and of irrigation scheduling as analytical tools to demonstrate the inconsistency between the current water delivery and crops’ and farmers’ requirements. This preliminary work also allowed highlighting the need for modernizing the irrigation management in the first of the two study areas considered for the present research work (system 1 located in the province of Taranto, southern Italy). An existing agro-hydrological model conceived to forecast water demand hydrographs in pressurized delivery networks was enhanced through several refinements and amendments of the computation algorithms. The refined model was applied for validation at different management levels on an existing pressurized irrigation system (system 2) located in the province of Foggia, southern Italy, where water withdrawals by farmers and the main hydraulic parameters are recorded on a continuous basis for monitoring purposes. Results from validation showed that the model is capable of forecasting with good accuracy the timing of peak-demand periods, the seasonal demand irrigation volumes, as <b>well</b> as the <b>hydrographs</b> of hourly flow rates demanded by farmers during these peak periods, especially when it is applied to large multi-cropped command areas. Performance indicators, originally conceived for diagnostic assessment in canal systems, were modified for application to pressurized distribution networks, and reference standard values were proposed. These indicators were then applied for validation to the second study area (irrigation system 2), where records of water deliveries are available, and showed their usefulness for diagnostic performance assessments...|$|R
