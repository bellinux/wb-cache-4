5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley.

5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form <b>when</b> <b>necessary</b> is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, <b>when</b> <b>necessary,</b> keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E

5|$|During normal {{passenger}} {{operation on}} revenue tracks, trains {{are designed to}} be controlled by an integrated Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and Automatic Train Control (ATC) system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention. All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains.

5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID.

No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other <b>when</b> <b>necessary</b> and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E
5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts <b>when</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only <b>when</b> <b>necessary</b> and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.|$|E
5|$|Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was {{established}} on 27 June 1921 {{to look after}} the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, <b>when</b> <b>necessary,</b> resettlement.

It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent disease and hunger.
