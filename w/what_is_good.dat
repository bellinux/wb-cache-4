25|$|While {{living in}} one's body an {{individual}} has conjunction with heaven through the angels, and with each person, {{there are at least}} two evil spirits and two angels. Temptation or pains of conscience originates from a conflict between evil spirits and angels. Due to man's sinful nature it is dangerous to have open direct communication with angels and can only be seen when one's spiritual sight has been opened. Thus from moment to moment angels attempt to lead each person to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> tacitly using the person's own thoughts.|$|E
25|$|For Epicurus, {{the purpose}} of {{philosophy}} was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia—peace and freedom from fear—and aponia—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that pleasure and pain are measures of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> and evil; death {{is the end of}} both body and soul and therefore should not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space.|$|E
25|$|While, however, Xenocrates (and {{with him}} Speusippus {{and the other}} {{philosophers}} of the older Academy) would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent. According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.|$|E

After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E
25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|Noddings {{tends to}} use unequal {{relationships}} {{as a model}} for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist Sarah Lucia Hoagland argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed {{in the role of the}} giver and the cared-for in the role of the taker. The one-caring is dominant, choosing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for the cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with insufficient control over the nature of the caring. Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good.|$|E

25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E
