50|$|Setting {{out from}} Lisbon (February-April), India-bound naus took the easy Canary Current {{straight}} southwest to the Canary Islands. The islands were owned by Castile {{and so this}} was not a usual <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the Portuguese India naus, except in emergencies.|$|R
5000|$|Diguvametta {{is located}} at [...] Its {{altitude}} coupled with its location give it a somewhat cooler climate {{than the rest of}} the district. It has ample water reserves in the form of reservoirs and ponds and was used as a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> trains earlier.|$|R
25|$|Because railway dining {{cars were}} not yet in common use, {{railroad}} timetables included water, rest, and meal stops. In addition, as the locomotives of {{the time needed to}} frequently replenish fuel and <b>water,</b> <b>stops</b> <b>for</b> passenger and crew meals were combined with the stops to replenish the locomotive's needs.|$|R
50|$|It {{was known}} as Mormon Well {{for the people who}} dug a well at the site as a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> freighters through Railroad Valley as early as 1870. Because of its supply of water, the site became a stop on the Midland Trail, and also became a ranch.|$|R

50|$|The town already {{existed before}} 1876. Kovilpatti was a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> steam engines after the {{introduction}} of the Southern Railways, and the establishment of textile mills like Loyal Textiles (1891) and Lakshmi Mills Ltd (1926) fueled the economic growth of the town. The Government Revenue divisional offices were sited there in 1911.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 21 September 1909, {{on the site}} of a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> steam {{locomotives}} that existed since 31 December 1904.

50|$|The {{location}} was originally a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> steam engines on the Canadian Pacific Railway line along the Macleod Trail when the trains {{first arrived in}} the area in 1891. The first settlers arrived in 1902, and the village was established in 1903. Claresholm was incorporated as a town in 1905, the year Alberta became a province. The community was named after Clare, a pioneer citizen.|$|R
5000|$|Oakville started {{life in the}} 1860s as a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> {{the steam}} train owned by The Napa Valley Railroad Company.

5000|$|When the {{railroad}} was expanding in the area, a widow {{who owned a}} large plantation became friendly with the contractor and persuaded him to change the route of {{the railroad}} to run through her plantation. After the railroad was built, she had nothing else to do with him. Feeling rejected, he named the <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> an old girlfriend named Tallulah, instead of the plantation owner.|$|R
50|$|The Santa Fe Railroad {{arrived in}} the 1880s and built a Point of Rocks station, which {{provided}} a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the steam engine locomotives then moving trains across the High Desert. On December 15, 1897, the name was changed to Helen in honor of Helen A. Wells (born 1885), daughter of railroad executive Arthur G. Wells (1861-1932). On September 22, 1918, the name was changed to Helendale.|$|R
50|$|The town {{started as}} a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in 1883. Ore {{was found in the}} nearby hills, leading to a boom. From 1906 to 1940 it was the {{southern}} railhead for the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, operated by the Pacific Coast Borax Company and bringing borax and other mining products from Death Valley and Beatty, Nevada to long distance Santa Fe Railway lines.|$|R
50|$|Vananda is {{a former}} unincorporated village in northwestern Rosebud County, Montana, USA, along the route of U.S. Highway 12. The town was {{established}} in 1908 as a station stop on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, then under construction across Montana. The railway used Vananda as a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> its steam locomotives, and built a small reservoir near the townsite to ensure an adequate water supply.|$|R
5000|$|Angellala {{railway station}} (...) {{was named after}} the nearby creek. It opened as a station from 2 May 1910, and was also worked as a {{crossing}} loop. From 1929 until 1932 the station was worked unattended; however a station mistress was appointed from 1932 date until 1971. Angellala was a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> locomotives, with the water tank situated at the Charleville end of the yard, and the hydrant at the Roma end.|$|R

50|$|Wilson Siding, {{also known}} as Wilson, is a {{locality}} in southern Alberta, Canada within the Lethbridge County. It {{is located at the}} intersection of Highway 4 and Highway 845, approximately 13 km southeast of Lethbridge. Wilson Siding gets its name from E.H. Wilson of the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company (ARIC) when a train stop was added in 1908 after Canadian Pacific Railway bought out ARIC. It was used a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> steam-powered trains.|$|R
50|$|In King of the Pecos, a 1936 film {{starring}} John Wayne, Muriel Evans, and Cy Kendall, Sweetwater {{is portrayed}} as a single homestead and {{said to be a}} necessary <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the first cattle drive presumably up what would become the Pecos Trail towards Abilene, where a new railhead has been completed. Pecos to Abilene is about 250 miles, but said to be 1600 miles by characters in the movie, though they cross the distance with cattle in a short time.|$|R
50|$|It {{was once}} said that, {{excluding}} ranch owners, their wives, and their cooks, {{at the time}} Chase County was organized it was populated entirely by cowboys. Part {{of the reason for}} such a statement may have been the fact that at one time Frenchman Creek and its main branch the Stinking Water Creek were used as <b>watering</b> <b>stops</b> <b>for</b> cattle drives that traveled from Texas to the Union Pacific railhead at Ogallala. These trails are known as the Western or Great Western trails.|$|R
50|$|During Chivington's early days, it {{supported}} {{a number of}} local businesses, the crown jewel being the $10,000, 60-room, 3-story Queen Anne styled Kingdon Hotelâ€”but when the railroad realized that Chivington's water had too high an alkali content {{to use in the}} locomotive boilers, a nearby town in Kansas (Horace) instead became an important <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the railroad. The Kingdon Hotel was disassembled (its intended purpose was to house railroad workers), and its materials shipped to two other Colorado communities for constructing buildings thereâ€”a common fate in Colorado, in the era.|$|R
5000|$|China {{was first}} known as [...] "China Grove", <b>for</b> a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the Texas and New Orleans Railroad that sat amidst {{a grove of}} chinaberry trees. In the 1860s a small {{community}} grew around the <b>water</b> <b>stop,</b> and another {{a few miles away}} named Nashland. A post office with the name [...] "China" [...] was established there in 1893. When fire destroyed the China Grove depot in 1906, the railroad rebuilt in the larger Nashland area, but retained the established name [...] "China" [...] as the name of the depot. The Nashland post office changed its name to China shortly afterward. It wasn't until 1971 that the (now-merged) community voted to incorporate as the city of China, Texas.|$|R
50|$|The Waterloo Memorial in Main Street is a {{bell-shaped}} stone gable {{carved with}} an anchored ship and dated 1816. It {{stands in front}} of the Waterloo Well with its Victorian iron pump and was a <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> horses. There are other wells at the side of Main Street by West Sands and on The Brae. Also on The Brae are pantiled cottages with forestairs, and the Old Schoolhouse, built in 1827. At the station, a large mosaic mural (1990) by local people including children from the nearby primary school marks the centenary of the opening of the rail bridge.|$|R
500|$|Beulah Hill (originally [...] "Gravel Pit Road") {{begins at}} a {{crossroads}} where the A215 crosses the A214 and Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill. The road makes a sharp turn to the east where it continues through the neighbourhoods of Upper Norwood. On the sharp bend is the ornamental Beulah Hill Pond. Formerly [...] "Big Pond", it {{was intended as a}} <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> horses and cattle using the road, and still contains a railing to prevent animals straying into deep water. The [...] "Conquering Hero" [...] pub was built next to the pond for the use of people stopping to allow livestock to use the pond, and remains today.|$|R
50|$|Palm Spring, {{a desert}} oasis amidst a {{mesquite}} thicket {{and a few}} palms, close to Carrizo Creek, was a popular camping spot on the Southern Emigrant Trail during the California Gold Rush. It became a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line in 1857 and a stage station site for the Butterfield Overland Mail Company in 1858. Located 9 miles east of Vallecito stage station and 9 miles west of Carrizo Stage Station, it was a relay or swing station, that provided water and a hostler living there that changed out tired coach teams with 5 horses kept there for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|Palm Spring, {{first used}} by the local Native Americans and those {{traveling}} {{to and from the}} Colorado River, was subsequently used by Spanish and later Mexican traders and American fur trappers and soldiers. It was a popular camping spot on the Southern Emigrant Trail during the California Gold Rush. It became a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line in 1857 and Palm Spring Station a relay stage station for the Butterfield Overland Mail from 1858 to 1861. It remained a watering place for later travelers to Arizona and for the stage lines that ran to Yuma, Arizona from 1867 to 1877.|$|R
5000|$|Arden, Brandon, Chivington, Diston, Eads, Fergus, Galatea, Haswell, Inman, Joliet, and Kilburn {{appeared}} {{one after}} another, some developing into towns, others being only {{a pipe dream}} {{in the eyes of}} developers. Chivington was intended as a major <b>watering</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the railroad (a 60-room, $10,000 [...] "crown jewel" [...] hotel was initially built there), but the water was too alkaline to use and the trains instead stopped in Kansas to tank up. The hotel was soon torn down, its materials shipped to other Colorado locations to use in constructing other facilities â€” a common occurrence in late 19th century Colorado, as boom towns went bust.|$|R

5000|$|Although in an {{isolated}} rural area, Parkside station had been designed as a junction station and <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> proposed connections with the Wigan Branch Railway and the Bolton and Leigh Railway, and had multiple lines of rails in place. A leaflet given to those travelling on the trains advised that while: [...] the apparatus at which the water is supplied is worth looking at ... we recommend the inspection to take place from the carriages. There are here five lines of rails, and the excitation arising from the approach of a carriage will generally so confuse a person not accustomed {{to walk on the}} railroad, as to make it almost impossible for him to discern which line it is coming on.|$|R
