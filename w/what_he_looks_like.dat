500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> how he talked. With Satan there's so much gray area." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the age of}} 7, Puyi {{had emerged}} with two sides to his personality; the sadistic emperor who loved to have his eunuchs flogged, {{expected}} everyone to kowtow to him and enjoyed puppet shows and dog fights, and the boy who slept at night with Wang, suckling her breasts, and content to be loved for just once in the day. Wang {{was the only person}} capable of controlling Puyi; once, Puyi decided to [...] "reward" [...] a eunuch for a well done puppet show by having a cake baked for him with iron filings in it, as Puyi said [...] "I want to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> when he eats it". With much difficulty, Wang talked Puyi out of this plan.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than what}} is learned of his {{character}} from the novels themselves, very {{little is known about}} Perry Mason. [...] His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake, although after The Case of the Velvet Claws fees are seldom discussed. Della Street is Mason's only (unacknowledged) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver is shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there is so little physical description of him that the reader is not even sure <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
50|$|Note, however, Norwegian John, som hadde sett mannen, visste hvordan han så ut (John, who {{had seen}} the man, knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like),</b> where the {{dependent}} clause is parenthetic.|$|R
5000|$|September 21, 2016: Grobe, realizing his {{comments}} about Oakman {{were taken out}} of context, claims he knew [...] "of" [...] the player but did not know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} forget her {{troubles}} {{for a little}} while, and {{began to think of}} Richard Darrien, her boy-lover of a long-past hour, wondering <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> now that <b>he</b> was grown to be a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, Count; but I {{hope to do}} so shortly. I know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> now. This gentleman is his twin-brother. They are doubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will rig him out fresh when I get him home," [...] {{he said to}} the merchant. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> now in that {{greatcoat}} and billycock hat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All night I waited!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{could not}} sit still. I could {{scarcely}} breathe. Tell {{me what he}} is like, Julia? Tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like?</b> Is he strong? Does he look strong enough for the work?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{soon they}} gained courage {{to look more}} closely at the Peculiar Person. As he was a type of all the {{inhabitants}} of this extraordinary land whom they afterward met, I will try to tell you <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite {{not knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> Adolf Eichmann {{believed}} he inspected Grynszpan in 1943 or 1944 according to Eichmann's own testimony {{at his trial}} in 1961, although Eichmann said he neither remembered nor knew {{what happened to him}} in the end.|$|R
50|$|Not much {{is known}} of the man as a person, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> or <b>what</b> people like Nathan Hale, William Coit or John Chapman thought of him but his {{distinguished}} service makes it likely {{that he was a}} good foot soldier and became respected in that area.|$|R
6000|$|... "My," [...] said Peter, [...] "I guess I'd better {{find out}} {{all about this}} other fellow before I have any trouble with him. The Old Pasture looks {{big enough for a}} lot of Rabbits, and perhaps if I don't bother him, he won't bother me. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> I believe I'll follow these tracks and see what I can find." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quoi faire, alors! Alvina, {{take him}} the {{rose to the}} gate, will you? Yes do! Their singing is horrible, I think. I can't go down to him. But do take him the roses, and see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> Yes do!" [...] Mrs. Tuke's eyes were arched and excited. Alvina looked at her slowly. Alvina also was smiling to herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "He {{is about}} the size of Unc' Billy Possum, and if you can imagine a pig of about that size with very short legs, a long {{tapering}} tail, feet with toes and long claws and a shell covering his whole body, the front of his face and even his tail, you will have something of an idea <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} hear more. I wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> how <b>he</b> spoke, how he {{compared}} with me in a thousand ways; but it was plain {{that she would not}} willingly be communicative about him; and, with a feeling of resentment, I gave her her way and suppressed my curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{yet they}} shallna, Alan! There's {{my hand on}} that," [...] cried James, {{for all the world}} as if he had really known my name and was {{foregoing}} some advantage. [...] "But just the habit he was in, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> and his age, and the like? I couldna well do less." ...|$|R
50|$|His name {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the Popish Plot fabricated by Titus Oates in 1678. Oates unwisely claimed to have met Don John in Madrid; when questioned closely by Charles II, who had met Don John in 1656, {{it became clear that}} Oates had no idea <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> confirming the King's suspicion that the Plot was an invention.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} of the sort," [...] said Mr. Marwood indignantly. [...] "There {{is no such thing}} as a picture of God, Felix. No human being knows what he looks like--no human being CAN know. We should not even try to think <b>what</b> <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> But, Felix, you may be sure that God is {{infinitely}} more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can imagine of Him. Never believe anything else, my boy. As for this--this SACRILEGE--take it and burn it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile the {{newcomer}} rattled on. [...] "I {{was at the}} inn an hour ago when he descended there, and I studied him attentively whilst he was at breakfast. Having done so, not a single doubt remains me of our success. As for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> I could entertain you at length upon the fashion in which nature has designed his gross fatuity. But that is no matter. We are concerned with what he is, with the wit of him. And I tell you confidently that I find him so dull and stupid {{that you may be}} confident he will tumble headlong into each and all of the traps I have so cunningly prepared for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. That's it," [...] {{replied the}} Captain, dryly. [...] "Now {{to hear what}} that service is to be. I've been a busy man since I took this job, and, {{as you may have}} heard, I've done a few things. I don't mind telling you that {{political}} influence put me in here and that up Austin way there's a good deal of friction in the Department of State in regard {{to whether or not the}} ranger service is any good--whether it should be discontinued or not. I'm on the party side who's defending the ranger service. I contend that it's made Texas habitable. Well, it's been up to me to produce results. So far I have been successful. My great ambition is to break up the outlaw gangs along the river. I have never ventured in there yet because I've been waiting to get the lieutenant I needed. You, of course, are the man I had in mind. It's my idea to start way up the Rio Grande and begin with Cheseldine. He's the strongest, the worst outlaw of the times. He's more than rustler. It's Cheseldine and his gang who are operating on the banks. They're doing bank-robbing. That's my private opinion, but it's not been backed up by any evidence. Cheseldine doesn't leave evidences. He's intelligent, cunning. No one seems to have seen him--to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> I assume, of course, that you are a stranger to the country he dominates. It's five hundred miles west of your ground. There's a little town over there called Fairdale. It's the nest of a rustler gang. They rustle and murder at will. Nobody knows who the leader is. I want you to find out. Well, whatever way you decide is best you will proceed to act upon. You are your own boss. You know such men and how they can be approached. You will take all the time needed, if it's months. It will be necessary for you to communicate with me, and that will be a difficult matter. For Cheseldine dominates several whole counties. You must find some way to let me know when I and my rangers are needed. The plan is to break up Cheseldine's gang. It's the toughest job on the border. Arresting him alone isn't to be heard of. He couldn't be brought out. Killing him isn't much better, for his select men, the ones he operates with, are as dangerous to the community as he is. We want to kill or jail this choice selection of robbers and break up the rest of the gang. To find them, to get among them somehow, to learn their movements, to lay your trap for us rangers to spring--that, Duane, is your service to me, and God knows it's a great one!" ...|$|E
5000|$|When Stalin returned, he {{was able}} to visit Kato at the police chief's house; the police did not know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> and the Svanidze sisters claimed he was their cousin.

25|$|Gudea's {{appearance}} is recognizable today {{because he had}} numerous statues or idols, depicting him with unprecedented, lifelike realism, placed in temples throughout Sumer. Gudea took advantage of artistic development because he evidently wanted posterity to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> And in that he has succeeded—a feat available to him as royalty, {{but not to the}} common people who could not afford to have statues engraved of themselves.|$|R

50|$|Georg Hackl (born 9 September 1966) is a German former luger who {{was three}} time Olympic and World Champion.

50|$|Aside from an avatar's {{physical}} appearance, its dialogue, {{particularly in}} cut scenes, may also reveal something of its character. A {{good example is}} the crude, action hero stereotype, Duke Nukem. Other avatars, such as Gordon Freeman from Half-Life, who never speaks at all, reveal very little of themselves (the original game never showed the player <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{without the use of}} a console command for third-person view).|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Sebastian's birth, Joanna {{was called}} back to Madrid by her brother Philip to act as regent during his absence in England. She filled this role with {{intelligence}} and efficiency. Joanna never remarried and never returned to Portugal.

50|$|Lucifer is {{the former}} king of the demon world. He loves to annoy and test Vivi all the time. He is related to Vivi but it is unknown to which status they are related. He's much older than Vivi and the others and he changes his {{appearance}} so much that <b>he</b> doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> ages ago. It is implied throughout the series that Lucifer may have romantic feelings for Hana.|$|R
50|$|Fuzzy22 {{has asked}} Jen {{to meet him}} in person, to which she reluctantly agrees, though Jen is very nervous - she and Fuzzy22 had agreed to not {{exchange}} any identifying information, so {{she has no idea}} how old he is, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> or if he is male or female.|$|E
