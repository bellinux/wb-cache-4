5|$|In 2006, Schiff {{sponsored}} eliminating {{a cap on}} taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered {{some local}} taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> greater competition in the local taxicab business. The City Council passed the cap lift, {{and the number of}} Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Reduction to {{funding for}} {{advertising}} for the 2017 and 2018 exchange enrollment periods {{by up to}} 90%, with other reductions to support resources used to answer questions and help people sign-up for coverage.

5|$|The {{victory at}} Bardia enabled the Allied forces to {{continue}} the advance into Libya and ultimately capture almost all of Cyrenaica. In turn this <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> German intervention in the fighting in North Africa, changing {{the nature of the}} war in that theatre.|$|E

This unique arrangement allowed for continuity {{of planning and}} expertise and helped overcome some of the disadvantages inherent in the U.S. armed forces policy of churning personnel through different assignments every three or so years. Within the service, the Nineteenth soon earned its nickname: The Suitcase Air Force.|$|R

5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's long-distance single-level trains {{operated}} with {{a combination}} of Amfleet and Heritage Fleet cars, supplemented in the 1990s by Viewliner sleeping cars. In 1990 Amfleets could be found on every long-haul route east of the Mississippi River. Horizon Fleet coaches replaced Amfleet coaches on most Midwestern and California short-haul routes in 1989–1990. The Superliner II order in the early 1990s <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the removal of Amfleets from the Virginia–Florida Auto Train and Chicago–Washington, D.C. Capitol Limited.|$|E

5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.

5|$|Dillon started DragonFly in {{the belief}} that the methods and {{techniques}} being adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> poor system performance and cause maintenance difficulties. He sought to correct these suspected problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to ongoing conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the FreeBSD codebase was eventually revoked. Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Prime Minister Menzies {{recommended}} that Playford be bestowed with {{a form of}} honours. Playford's wish was to be made a privy councillor, yet, while entirely possible, if granted it <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a KCMG, and Playford himself did initially, but {{under the influence of}} Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957, but this time a class above the KCMG; the GCMG.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the compulsory purchase of the barn. It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E
