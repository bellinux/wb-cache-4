2500|$|The {{theology}} of baptism attained precision in the 3rd and 4th centuries. <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> {{was at first}} given after baptism, believers were given increasingly specific instructions before being baptized, especially {{in the face of}} heresies in the 4th century. By the 4th and 5th centuries, a series of rites spread over several weeks led up to the actual baptism at Easter: catechumens attended several meetings of intensive catechetical instruction, often by the bishop himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, exorcisms, and other rites. [...] Catechumens recited the Creed on Holy Saturday to show that they had completed their catechetical instruction. [...] At dawn following the Paschal Vigil starting the night of Holy Saturday, they were taken to the baptistry where the bishop consecrated the water with a long prayer recounting the types of baptisms. The catechumens disrobed, were anointed with oil, renounced the devil and his works, confessed their faith in the Trinity, and were immersed in the font. They were then anointed with chrism, received the laying on of hands, clothed in white, and led to join the congregation in the Easter celebration. [...] By then, postponement of baptism had become general, and a large proportion of believers were merely catechumens (Constantine was not baptized until he was dying); but as baptisms of the children of Christians, using an adaptation of the rite intended for adults, became more common than baptisms of adult converts, the number of catechumens decreased.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is exactly what}} it sounds like. The teacher simply distributes one red card and one green card to each student. Then, during the lesson <b>while</b> <b>instruction</b> is taking place, students can hold up either card to show how well they understand. If the teacher sees his or her students holding up all green cards, they know to continue their lesson. But if the students are holding up red cards, the teacher knows that something was unclear {{and needs to be}} discussed further. This type of immediate feedback is helpful for the teacher to see how well students are learning, and it also gives the students an opportunity to engage and take control of their learning. This {{technique is}} typically practiced in elementary classrooms although it can also be effective in the {{middle school and high school}} grade levels.|$|E

5000|$|<b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> in {{the liberal}} arts and {{sciences}} dates to the founding of Tufts College in 1852, the formal organization of the school came almost fifty years later. In 1903, the Trustees of Tufts College adopted a [...] "new plan" [...] of organization that divided the college into several schools: Liberal Arts (formerly Letters), Engineering, Divinity (or Religion), Graduate Arts and Sciences, {{as well as the}} schools of medicine and dental medicine. The first four, all located on the Medford/Somerville campus, were grouped together as the [...] "Department of Arts and Sciences" [...] (later the Faculty of Arts and Sciences). This organization required any policy that affected the schools in the Department (the [...] "Associated Schools") to be considered first by the constituent faculty and then by parent body. (This pattern of organization continues to the present day). The medical and dental school, located in Boston, remained outside this overlapping pattern of organization, as did the Fletcher School (established in 1933).|$|E
50|$|Following {{a request}} for its {{services}} and locally obtained support from ministries of health and other governing entities in partner countries, IVUmed conducts a site visit and assessment. Once specific needs and goals have been outlined, IVUmed typically engages {{in a series of}} annual 6-14 day surgical workshops spanning 3-4 years. The first workshop involves further evaluation of the host site and personnel <b>while</b> <b>instruction</b> begins on less complex procedures, such as hypospadias repair during pediatric workshops. This is a good focus for the first workshop since it requires less sophisticated equipment and patient recovery than more complex procedures. Also, since hypospadias is the most common urological birth defect, the first workshop begins to address one of the host site’s most pressing demands. During each successive workshop, IVUmed’s goal is to effectively teach more complex cases while reinforcing training from the previous workshop. IVUmed’s ‘Teach one, Reach many’ model aims to replicate the success of sites like Vietnam, helping each partner learn the skills necessary to independently meet the needs of their patients while passing along the skills learned from IVUmed to future generations of medical personnel. This will develop a sustainable solution to an enormous healthcare need capable of growing to meet increased future demand.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} a {{content analysis of}} virtual reference transcripts taken from the Charlotte Mecklenburg County Public Library virtual reference service. The analysis was performed {{in order to determine}} whether and how information literacy instruction is performed in the virtual reference setting. A codebook of instances of instruction was used to identify occurrences of information literacy instruction in the transcripts. Ninety-one chat sessions out of 104 demonstrated instances of information literacy instruction. The majority of this instruction involved the finding and retrieval of information. Little instruction dealt with the use of information once retrieved. Most instruction in this setting seems to happen implicitly, as the librarian performs a search or uses a source.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{considers}} {{teaching and}} learning as a collaborative enterprise in the workplace. The empirical data have been extracted from a field study among apprentices engaged in electromechanical vocational training and education in a major Danish industrial company. Typically, studies of apprenticeship learning do not view aspects of teaching as decisive parts of workplace learning. In this article, I will pin down the specific character of collaborative {{teaching and learning}} in the workplace, and compare this with the features of a teaching situation in school with a teacher transmitting knowledge to the pupils. <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> at school is organised {{as part of a}} specifically planned teaching situation, the instruction in the workplace is a more loosely organised part of the joint activity structure of the daily work tasks. The conclusions reached in the article should be useful for the conceptual understanding of instruction and teaching in workplace learning, as well as for policy makers and professionals responsible for the design of apprenticeships and workplace learning...|$|E

40|$|The post methods era has {{witnessed}} {{a dramatic change}} in approaches to and methods of teaching as well as testing.

Such a cyber-based environment provides immersive and authentic learning, mixed with a type of e-assessment task, no longer functioning like a summative test but it has become learning and teaching tool.

30|$|The {{current study}} {{suggested}} a drop-landing task that {{makes use of}} drop heights that may be appropriate for rehabilitation purposes and are functional in daily life. This study examined transient knee joint loads during the drop-landing response {{and the effect of}} drop height and instruction cues on knee joint loads. Further, this study took steps toward a development of standardized exercise task to examine the effect of acute bouts of mechanical loading on bone and cartilage metabolism in humans, since previous research has been focused on animal models [15, 16]. Consistent with previous literature [24, 30], we found that the knee joint compression force increased with drop height and the instruction to land stiffly. Though sagittal knee joint moment scaled with instruction at the high height, it did not change with instruction set at the low height, suggesting that <b>while</b> <b>instruction</b> can increase knee joint compression at the low height, knee joint moment and perhaps; therefore, joint injury risk are not increased with the instruction set at the low height. Precautions were taken to standardize drop-landing task; demonstrations of step-off and landing techniques were provided. The results suggest relatively low, approximately 7 %, variability within subjects in the measure of peak sagittal knee angle across conditions (Table  2).|$|E
30|$|Many {{topics in}} science are {{notoriously}} difficult {{for students to}} learn. Mechanisms and processes outside student experience present particular challenges. <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> typically involves visualizations, students usually explain in words. Because visual explanations can show parts and processes of complex systems directly, creating them should have benefits beyond creating verbal explanations. We compared learning from creating visual or verbal explanations for two STEM domains, a mechanical system (bicycle pump) and a chemical system (bonding). Both kinds of explanations were analyzed for content and learning assess by a post-test. For the mechanical system, creating a visual explanation increased understanding particularly for participants of low spatial ability. For the chemical system, creating both visual and verbal explanations improved learning without new teaching. Creating a visual explanation was superior and benefitted participants of both high and low spatial ability. Visual explanations often included crucial yet invisible features. The greater effectiveness of visual explanations appears attributable to the checks they provide for completeness and coherence {{as well as to}} their roles as platforms for inference. The benefits should generalize to other domains like the social sciences, history, and archeology where important information can be visualized. Together, the findings provide support for the use of learner-generated visual explanations as a powerful learning tool.|$|E

40|$|In 2010, the Oregon Tech Library {{moved to}} a new campus-wide content {{management}} system. This change, and the popularization of products such as LibGuides and Library a la Carte, inspired Oregon Tech librarians to develop new subject guides. As a means of participating in the new system and of saving money, the library created a subject guide format to be used on the web content management system, Sitefinity. The guide format was designed by a committee with librarian and library staff input, but without assistance from students— the target audience. As a result, the guides that were developed tended to be text heavy and riddled with library jargon that did not make sense to students. In addition, the guides were difficult to edit, resulting in dated content and frequent broken links. <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> librarians would push relevant guides in their classes, they never caught on among students. By 2014, Oregon Tech librarians were aware of problems with their subject guides and had begun to consider technology and formatting changes to make the guides more accessible.

40|$|Abstract: <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> on {{control of}} {{variables}} {{has been shown}} to be effective, especially when it encourages students to focus explicitly on rules or procedures, little evidence of application to novel problems has been obtained. We hypothesized that prompting students to understand their own learning processes while doing experiments involving control of variables would allow them to activate their reper-toire of knowledge and strategies and learn in a way that would enhance transfer of learning. Students were assigned to one of four versions of a computer-based biology simulation learning environment, each em-ploying a different type of prompt: reason justification, rule based, emotion focused, or none (control). Learning in this computer environment, college biology students designed and conducted experiments in-volving control of variables. Students ’ ability to solve both contextually similar (near transfer) and con-textually dissimilar (far transfer) problems was assessed. The treatment groups performed equally well on contextually similar problems. However, on a contextually dissimilar problem, the reason justification group had significantly higher scores than the other groups. Qualitative data showed that the reason justi-fication prompts directed students ’ attention to understanding when, why, and how to employ experiment design principles and strategies, and this in turn helped students to transfer their understanding to a novel problem. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{instruction}} scheduling logic {{is one of}} the most critical components of modern superscalar microprocessors, both from the delay and power dissipation standpoints. The delay and energy requirement of driving the result tags across the associatively-addressed issue queue accounts for a significant percentage of the scheduler’s overhead and also limits the design scalability. We propose two schemes to reduce the power consumption and the delays of the wakeup logic. Our first scheme – instruction packing – shares the associative part of an issue queue entry between two instructions, each with at most one non-ready source. As a result, the number of entries in the issue queue (and, hence, the length of the tag buses) can be reduced by a factor of two with almost no impact on the IPCs, because most instructions either enter the pipeline with at least one of their source operands ready, or do not make use of two source registers to begin with. Our second scheme – tag memoization – avoids driving the upper portion of the tags, if those bits did not change their values from what was driven on the same tag bus during the most recent broadcast. <b>While</b> <b>instruction</b> packing results in the reduced length of the tag buses, tag memoization reduced the number of tag lines that need to be driven. We evaluate our designs using detailed microarchitectural simulations of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks and the SPICE simulations of the issue queue layouts. 1...|$|E
