2500|$|Hazlitt then {{lays out}} several things <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> {{if we are}} to accept this proposition. First, the idea was not at all {{original}} with Malthus but was conceived, even in many details, [...] "in an obscure and almost forgotten work published about the middle of the last century, entitled Various Prospects of Mankind, Nature, and Providence, by a Scotch gentleman of the name of Wallace."

2500|$|Hawking did {{not rule}} out the {{existence}} of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time [...] "Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?" [...] In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of Time he wrote: [...] "If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reasonfor then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> the mind of God." [...] In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.|$|E
2500|$|In the matrimonial domain, Tunisia remains often {{considered}} as a state open to the advances of the modern world. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> that Tunisia celebrates two days dedicated to women: March 8, International Woman's Day and August 13, anniversary of the Code's promulgation which became a holiday, [...] "National Woman's Day." [...] On {{the occasion of the}} fiftieth anniversary of the Code, the president announced two legal projects which were adopted by the Chambers of Deputies on May, 2007.

2500|$|Activist Joyce Shepard of Bayside, New York of the Citizens Action Committee for Change {{tried to}} {{highlight}} the issue of abused women. She contacted Hevesi's office to investigate. Hevesi issued a critical report on the Giuliani administration. On April 17, 1997, she was at New York City Hall with both Giuliani and Hevesi side by side. They promised more space for victims of domestic abuse. Despite all the promises nothing happened. She went undercover to expose the shortcomings of the shelter system. She criticized both Hevesi and Giuliani. After she was quoted by the Village Voice, Hevesi reportedly phoned her and told her: [...] "Don't you ever call my office about anything again!".

2500|$|In The New Jerusalem, Chesterton made {{it clear}} that he {{believed}} that there was a [...] "Jewish Problem" [...] in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe. He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that [...] "every Jew must be dressed like an Arab [...] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point is that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land." [...] He suggested the formation of a Jewish homeland as a solution, and was later invited to Palestine by Jewish Zionists who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.|$|E
