5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
60|$|At half-past five's Revelly, an' our tents they down must come, Like {{a lot of}} button {{mushrooms}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> 'em up at 'ome. But it's over in a minute, an' at six {{the column}} starts, While the women and the kiddies sit an' shiver in the carts.|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Dog {{wrapped in}} tow-line] There is {{something}} very strange and unaccountable about a tow-line. You roll it up with as much patience and care as you would take to fold up {{a new pair of}} trousers, and five minutes afterwards, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> it up, it is one ghastly, soul-revolting tangle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, Mr. Crawshay," [...] he asked, [...] "how {{long was}} the gap {{of time between}} your losing sight of Jocelyn Thew and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> him up in London?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{must take}} the wheel awhile, lad, so I can hunt for the charts. It won't do to storm along like this without a little smatterin' of what's ahead, an' we'll {{make some kind of}} a guess as to where the brig was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> me up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” I said, flinging {{the door}} open and seizing her {{suddenly}} in my arms, “if you can’t walk then you shall be carried,” and I lifted her from the ground so abruptly that she could not help catching me round the neck as any child almost will do instinctively <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> it up.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you {{see that}} canoe, that came out last, is {{paddling}} down towards us? It {{looks as if it}} were drifting, but I have seen them dip a paddle in, several times. The others are pulling up their lines, so as to be in readiness to join in. Get your piece ready to pick up, and aim the moment I give the word. They {{think they are going to}} surprise us, but we must be first with them. Go on with your fishing, and just drop your line overboard, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up your gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not; but you may. Cast {{your mind}} {{back to that}} night at White's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> your quarrel with me, my lord. Do you {{remember}} how Stapleton and Collis spoke up for me, declared that they had known me from boyhood at Oxford, and had visited me at my chateau in France? What {{was the name of}} that chateau, my lord--do you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! shove off {{and save}} him," [...] shouted Montague, {{the moment he}} heard it. [...] "Look alive, lads, give way! and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>picked</b> up the man, pull {{straight}} for yonder schooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that I should lack the odour of sanctity, Geoffrey; but what else can one do? Think it over, man. The way in which you played the idiot <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were <b>picked</b> {{out of the water}} shows that you are quick at contriving a plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I mistrust you," [...] said David, sagely wagging his head. [...] "The Lowland Scotch {{part of you}} is all right, but there's a Celtic {{streak in}} you, from that little Highland {{grandmother}} of yours, and when a man has that there's never any knowing where it will break out, or what dance it will lead him, {{especially when it comes}} to this love-making business. You are just as likely as not to lose your head over some little fool or shrew for the sake of her outward favour and make yourself miserable for life. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> you a wife please remember that I shall reserve the right to pass a candid opinion on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That oughtn't to be difficult. What {{will you}} have? Of course she's very pretty and I'm sure she's good. But I won't tell you {{she is a}} marvel, because you must remember--you young fellows think your {{own point of view}} and your own {{experience}} everything--that I've seen beauties without number. I've known the most charming women of our time--women of an order to which Miss Francie, con rispetto parlando, will never begin to belong. I'm difficult about women--how can I help it? Therefore <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up a little American girl at an inn and bring her to us as a miracle, feel how standards alter. J'ai vu mieux que ca, mon cher. However, I accept everything to-day, as you know; when once one has lost one's enthusiasm everything's the same and one might as well perish by the sword as by famine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Grant {{shook his}} bushy grey head. [...] "That's {{not the real}} reason, son. The world has a wife for every man; if he hasn't found her by the time he's thirty-five, there's some real reason for it. Well, I don't want to pry into yours, but I hope it's a sound one and not a mean, sneaking, selfish sort of reason. Perhaps you'll choose a Madam Selwyn some day yet. In case you should I'm {{going to give you}} a small bit of good advice. Your mother--now, she's a splendid woman, Selwyn, a splendid woman. She can't be matched as a {{housekeeper}} and she has improved my finances until I don't know them when I meet them. She's been a good wife and a good mother. If I were a young man I'd court her and marry her over again, that I would. But, son, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> a wife pick one with a nice little commonplace nose, not a family nose. Never marry a woman with a family nose, son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} wonderfully well for yourself, lad; wonderfully well. Certainly <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> up Burmese from my man, {{we had no}} idea that it was ever likely to turn out so useful. I thought {{that it would have been}} an {{assistance}} among the Mugs on the coast; and I had, too, some idea that the war might lead to the opening of a trade up the Irrawaddy; but it has turned out infinitely more useful than that. If you could not have spoken Burmese, Bandoola would never have thought of asking for you to be spared as an interpreter and, if he had not done so, you would have had your head chopped off, at Ava.|$|R
6000|$|... "When Jack {{brought you}} to us for dead, we did not take it off, dear," [...] she said gently. [...] "I wept with sorrow and joy at sight of it, for I remembered you as <b>you</b> were <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> those flowers, and how lightly I had thought of leaving you as I wound them into my hair. And then, when I had gone aboard the 'Annapolis', I knew all at once that I would have given {{anything}} to stay, and I thought my heart would break when we left the Severn cliffs behind. But that, sir, has been a secret until this day," [...] she added, smiling archly through her tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Until a {{few moments}} ago, the report was that you had been {{captured}} in the first rush of the rear-guard which we were rolling up for your attack, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were <b>picked</b> up, just now, in plain clothes on the slope, you were not recognized. The one thing seemed to be as improbable as the other," [...] he added significantly.|$|R

5000|$|... "When {{you find}} {{yourself}} searching for some mechanical explanation, if you don't know the answer, invent one. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> out some inconsistency or marvelous improbability, satisfy your curiosity like the old Indian folk: 'Well, that's the way they tell that story.

5000|$|You simply choose 6 numbers {{using your}} {{telephone}} {{by calling the}} number on screen during the show and follow the prompts.

You see, I am no navigator," [...] he {{explained}} {{a few minutes}} later, as he stood by the captain aft, the latter with gaze wandering from aloft to overside as he estimated the Pyrenees' speed. [...] "You must fetch her to Mangareva. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>picked</b> up the land, then I will pilot her in. What {{do you think she}} is making?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The bag is {{all she has}} - look at it {{with affection}} … From the first you should know how she feels about it … When the bag is at the right height you peer in, see what things are there and then get them out.

5000|$|As a vertical-scrolling run and gun, {{the player}} fights enemies on foot, moving upward through the stage. Since forward {{movement}} is not automatic, the game imposes {{a time limit}} {{in the form of}} an energy bar that slowly drains as time goes on. If the bar empties completely, you lose a life. It is refilled <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up [...] "E" [...] icons or complete a level. The energy bar does not represent health, as touching one enemy or bullet will immediately cost you one life. After dying, you reappear at an earlier point in the level.|$|E
5000|$|Most reviews though {{have noted}} that the touch screen {{controls}} can become clustered in high intensity scenes. When the screen gets crowded, the game may think you are picking up an enemy when you are actually trying to fire. [...] "The controls do {{get in the way}} from time to time where you’re trying to fire, but the game thinks you’re trying to pick up an enemy in the water or vice versa. Also <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up enemies the camera zooms in and when this happens you can’t see the ship locations to fire upon them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhen Yi once {{brought his}} {{children}} to meet Liu Liang (劉良), a fortune teller, who commented on Lady Zhen, [...] "This girl will become very noble in the future." [...] Unlike many children of her age, the young Lady Zhen did not enjoy playing. Once, when she was eight years old, her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horse-riding performers outside their house but Lady Zhen did not join in. Her sisters were puzzled so they asked her, and she responded, [...] "Is this something a girl should watch?" [...] When she was nine years old, she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers' writing materials. Her brothers told her, [...] "You should be learning what women traditionally do (such as weaving). <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> up reading, were you thinking of becoming a female academician?" [...] Lady Zhen replied, [...] "I heard that virtuous women in history learnt from the successes and failures of those who lived before them. If they didn't read, how did they learn all that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fellow," [...] {{said the}} Governor, turning his face sternly on the Master, [...] "I know {{more of you}} than you think for. We have some broken ends of your adventures in the provinces, which you will do very well not to drive me to investigate. There is the {{disappearance}} of Mr. Jacob Chew with all his merchandise; there {{is the matter of}} where you came ashore from with so much money and jewels, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were <b>picked</b> up by a Bermudan out of Albany. Believe me, if I let these matters lie, it is in commiseration for your family and out of respect for my valued friend, Lord Durrisdeer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cullum explained: [...] "I'd {{split up}} with someone and met {{the love of my}} life so this is a {{break-up}} song about feeling heartbroken then having that moment where the switch flips and you realise you're fine. It's an example of me writing lyrics that appear to make sense but don't necessarily <b>when</b> <b>you</b> try and <b>pick</b> them apart. It's the snappiest, poppiest song I've ever done and it was written in 90 minutes." ...|$|R
50|$|All wrestlers {{have the}} same moves, with the {{exception}} of individualized strike attacks. The moveset consists of attack moves (punch and kick), a bodyslam, grappling moves that can only be performed <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> your opponent up from the mat (piledriver, suplex, headlock with punches), ground attack moves (elbow or knee drop), Irish whip moves (clothesline and dropkick), and flying turnbuckle moves (elbow or knee drop). Players can also wrestle outside the ring by throwing their opponent over the ropes or by performing a dropkick through the ropes. Throwing the opponent out of the ring can be done once per match and causes considerable damage.|$|E
5000|$|The song, {{performed}} {{entirely in}} English, was an up-tempo ode to positive thought; though ironically, {{the song is}} written entirely in a minor key. The band (only the second to win the Contest in a non-native language after ABBA the year before) sings that one should [...] "sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong" [...] when one is feeling unhappy, and continues [...] "Ding-a-dong every hour, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> a flower. Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone." [...] On {{the night of the}} Dutch National Song Contest, with the song already having been selected, Albert West and Debbie competed with Teach-In for the honour of performing.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 {{with large}} numbers of public {{allegations}} arising accusing priests of sexual abuse against minors, Groeschel caused some controversy during a sermon at a Yonkers church. He described the news reporting on the matter as a [...] "media persecution" [...] against Catholicism intended [...] "to destroy whatever public influence the church might have." [...] This perception of persecution was one [...] "Many church officials concurred in", The New York Times would later report. Groeschel also told the Yonkers audience that [...] "I've met with some of those people accused priests and they are among the most penitent people I have met in my life. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up the media, you don’t hear about the penitence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, big enough. We don't {{want her}} bigger. A hundred and ninety, going two hundred," [...] replied the captain. [...] "She's fully big for us three; {{it would be}} all the better if we had another hand, though it's a pity too, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can <b>pick</b> up natives for half nothing. Then we must have a cook. I can fix raw sailor-men, but there's no going to sea with a new-chum cook. I can lay hands on the man we want for that: a Highway boy, an old shipmate of mine, of the name of Amalu. Cooks first-rate, and it's always better to have a native; he ain't fly, you can turn him to as you please, and he don't know enough to stand out for his rights." ...|$|R

"Yes, CONTRADICTED me: that's what I mean,--once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{said those}} rocks were volcanic, once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said the flower <b>you</b> <b>picked</b> was a poppy.
