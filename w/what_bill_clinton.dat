In an over-reaction against the third way experience, it “threw out the baby with the bathwater”: instead of analysing carefully <b>what</b> Tony Blair, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Wim Kok, Gerhard Schröder and others got wrong, it yearned for a lost era of egalitarian basics without clearly working out what that meant and what its electoral implications would be. It saw the massive failure of markets as an opportunity to bring back the state when in fact rising public debt led to a crisis of the state, which in the public mind loomed larger than the crisis of the market. It struggled to formulate a publicly compelling alternative to austerity.

The CIA was given an impossible mission in Somalia, as was the military. Casualties came quickly and were high in the eight man team the CIA sent. A post mortem carried out by now FISA member Admiral Crowe stated that the National Security Council had expected the CIA to both make decisions, {{and give them the}} intelligence to base those decisions on.

40|$|During {{his first}} {{campaign}} for the presidency in 1992, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was dogged by {{what came to be}} called the 2 ̆ 2 character issue. 2 ̆ 2 Critics charged that Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s character was flawed in ways that made him unfit to be president. They said that he had dodged the draft during the Vietnam War, showing personal cowardice and an unwillingness to put the interests of the country before his own. They accused him of marital infidelity, claiming that he had been as disloyal to his wife as to the nation. Marriage is an institution of love that demands a renunciation of the pleasures of free sexuality, and fidelity to a single person. Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s attackers claimed that he lacked the will to forego these pleasures, to make the sacrifice that marriage demands, preferring his own gratification to the welfare of the woman to whom he had pledged his love. So too, they said, he had been unwilling to sacrifice his own safety and well-being {{for the good of the}} country in a time of war, another form of infidelity. His critics acknowledged that Clinton had many ideas, that he was (as some described him) a 2 ̆ 2 policy wonk 2 ̆ 2 with a vast repertoire of programs and plans. But they insisted that he lacked the habits of self-sacrificing love on which the people 2 ̆ 7 s trust might securely be based. <b>What</b> emerged from <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> 2 ̆ 7 s life, they said, was the portrait of a man driven by self-centered desires, a man who would never make a sacrifice for anything or anyone other than himself, and whose declared commitments - to people and programs and ultimately to the country itself - therefore could not be trusted...|$|R
