25|$|Grimm's law {{as applied}} to pre-proto-Germanic is a chain shift of the {{original}} Indo-European plosives.

25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the <b>word</b> <b>accent</b> match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that {{the distinction between the}} first two rules and the latter rule can also be found in early treatises on music, introducing the terms metrum and rhythmus. As it could also be demonstrated by Van Kampen that melodic peaks often coincide with the <b>word</b> <b>accent</b> (see also), the conclusion seems warranted that the Gregorian melodies enhance the expressiveness of the Latin words by mimicking to some extent both the accentuation of the sacred words (pitch differences between neumes) and the relative duration of the word syllables (by paying attention to well-defined length differences between the individual notes of a neume).|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{production}} and perception of Swedish <b>word</b> <b>accents</b> by Somali L 1 speakers is investigated. The Feature hypothesis, stating that {{it is easier to}} acquire a phonological feature in an L 2 if the same phonological feature is used in the L 1 will be the framework used. Somali is a language that also makes us of <b>word</b> <b>accents.</b> Therefore, the two languages are placed in the same level of the Tonal prominence hierarchy and the L 2 acquisition of Swedish <b>word</b> <b>accents</b> by Somali L 1 speakers is suitable to test. The production is tested by analyzing read speech, with elicited target words in focal position with either accent 1 or accent 2. The perception is tested with a discrimination test of the two <b>word</b> <b>accents,</b> and two different Swedish varieties are used: Central Swedish and South Swedish. Two groups are tested. One consists of Somali L 1 speakers with Swedish L 2 and one consists of speakers with both Somali and Swedish L 1. The results show that the L 2 group does make the distinction between A 1 and A 2 in {{the production}} test, but the result for the 2 L 1 group is less clear and can be interpreted as that they did not make use of the Swedish <b>word</b> <b>accents.</b> In the perception test, none of the two groups performed better than chance and had significantly lower scores than a Swedish L 1 control group. The findings in this thesis confirm the Feature hypothesis in the production part, but contradict it in the perception part...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{discusses}} the Central Swedish <b>word</b> <b>accents</b> – Accent 1 and Accent 2 – and their productive association to suffixes {{from the point}} of view of prediction theories of speech processing. Based on recent neurophysiological findings, we propose that both <b>word</b> <b>accents</b> are used predictively, but that Accent 1 is more ‘predictively useful’ than Accent 2, due to the fact that Accent 1 stems signal a smaller well-defined set of upcoming affixes as compared to Accent 2. This ‘usefulness’ allows suffixes to be pre-activated before they have even been heard...|$|R
25|$|Further {{emphasizing}} and {{elevating the}} artistry {{of the language}} of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favor in strong <b>word</b> <b>accent</b> or verse ictus, stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the trochaic septenarius. Iambic words, though common in Latin, are difficult to fit in this meter, and naturally occur at the end of verses. G.B. Conte has noted that Plautus favors the use of cantica instead of Greek meters. This vacillation between meter and word stress highlights the fact that Latin literature was still in its infancy, and that there was not yet a standard way to write verse.|$|E
500|$|Although {{letters and}} speech sounds {{do not have}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and <b>word</b> <b>accent</b> are reliable for most English words. Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph, photography, and photographic, or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is [...] "near-optimal", there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns. The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world. Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.|$|E

Where the <b>word</b> <b>accent</b> {{is at odds with}} the ictus, it is more natural to follow the accent (just as is the case when reading Virgil). Occasionally, however, an apparent clash between ictus and accent may indicate the actual pronunciation; for example, it is believed that the phrase volŭptás mea [...] "my darling" [...] was pronounced with the accent on -tas. Similarly, vae miseró mihi [...] "o wretched me!" [...] appears to have been pronounced with the accent on -ro.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{the strength}} of a foreign accent and varying types of experience with foreign-accented speech influence the recognition of <b>accented</b> <b>words.</b> In Experiment 1, native Dutch listeners with limited or extensive prior experience with German-accented Dutch completed a cross-modal priming experiment with strongly, medium, and weakly <b>accented</b> <b>words.</b> Participants with limited experience were primed by the medium and weakly <b>accented</b> <b>words,</b> but not by the strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words.</b> Participants with extensive experience were primed by all accent types. In Experiments 2 and 3, Dutch listeners with limited experience listened to a short story before doing the cross-modal priming task. In Experiment 2, the story was spoken by the priming task speaker and either contained strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words</b> or did not. Strongly accented exposure led to immediate priming by novel strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words,</b> while exposure to the speaker without strongly accented tokens led to priming only in the experiment’s second half. In Experiment 3, listeners listened to the story with strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words</b> spoken by a different German-accented speaker. Listeners were primed by the strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words,</b> but again only in the experiment’s second half. Together, these results show that adaptation to foreign-accented speech is rapid but depends on accent strength and on listener familiarity with those strongly <b>accented</b> <b>words...</b>|$|R
