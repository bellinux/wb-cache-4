6000|$|Our {{exposition}} of the phenomena {{presented by the}} struggle for existence may be fitly concluded by a few remarks on its ethical aspect. Now that the war of nature is better known, it has been dwelt upon by many writers as presenting so vast an amount of cruelty and pain as to be revolting to our instincts of humanity, while it has proved a stumbling-block {{in the way of}} those who would fain believe in an all-wise and benevolent ruler of the universe. Thus, a brilliant writer says: [...] "Pain, grief, disease, and death, are these the inventions of a loving God? That no animal shall rise to excellence except by being fatal to the life of others, is this the law of a kind Creator? It is useless to say that pain has its benevolence, that massacre has its mercy. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> ordained that bad should be the raw material of good? Pain is not the less pain because it is useful; murder is not less murder because it is conducive to development. Here is blood upon the hand still, and all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten it."[13] ...|$|E

Being {{prepared}} now to find among plants {{many things}} which are like roots, yet are not; you may simplify and make fast your true idea of a root as a fibre or group of fibres, which fixes, animates, and partly feeds the leaf. Then practically, as you examine plants in detail, ask first respecting them: What kind of root have they? Is it large or small in proportion to their bulk, and <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so?</b> What soil does it like, and what properties does it acquire from it? The endeavour {{to answer these questions}} will soon lead you to a rational inquiry into the plant's history. You will first ascertain what rock or earth it delights in, and what climate and circumstances; then you will see how its root is fitted to sustain it mechanically under given pressures and violences, and to find for it the necessary sustenance under given difficulties of famine or drought. Lastly you will consider what chemical actions appear to be going on in the root, or its store; what processes there are, and elements, which give pungency to the radish, flavour to the onion, or sweetness to the liquorice; and of what service each root may be made capable under cultivation, and by proper subsequent treatment, either to animals or men.|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers a}} short {{account of the}} Great Depression in Europe, aimed at historians without a strong {{training}} in economics. The introduction sets out four key questions around which the book is organized: What were {{the origins of the}} Depression? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> severe? How <b>was</b> recovery effected, and <b>was</b> <b>it</b> sustainable? and What were the implications of the recovery for political relations in and between nation-states?...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so?</b> Why has God so {{ordered the}} world and human nature, that pride punishes itself? Because, I presume, pride is begotten and born of a lie, and God hates a lie, because all lies lead to ruin, and this lie of pride above all. It is as it were the root lie of all lies. The very lie by which, as old tales tell, Satan fell from heaven, and {{when he tried to}} become a god in his own right, found himself, to his {{surprise}} and disappointment, only a devil. For pride and self-conceit contradict the original constitution of man and the universe, which is this--that of God are all things, and in God are all things, and for God are all things. Man depends on God. Self tells him that he depends on himself. [...] Man has nothing but what he receives from God. Self tells him that what he has is his own, and that he has a right to do with it what he likes. [...] Man knows nothing but what God teaches him. Self tells him that he has found out everything for himself, and can say what he thinks fit without fear of God or man. Therefore the proud, self-willed, self-conceited man must come to harm, like Malvolio in the famous play, merely because he is in the blackest night of ignorance. He has mistaken who he is, what he is, where he is. He is fancying himself, as many mad men do, the centre of the universe; while God is the centre of the universe. He is just as certain to come to harm as a man would be on board a ship, who should fancy that he himself, and not the ship, was keeping him afloat, and step overboard to walk upon the sea. We all know what would happen to that man. Let us thank God our Father that He not only knows what would happen to such men: but desires to save them from the consequences of their own folly, by letting them feel the consequences of their own folly.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is all my art to me now," [...] {{said the}} painter, gravely. [...] "I {{sometimes}} think, Harry, {{that there are}} only two eras of any importance in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinoüs was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that Art cannot express it. There is nothing that Art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life {{in a way that was}} hidden from me, before. 'A dream of form in days of thought:'--who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad--for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty--his merely visible presence--ah! I wonder can you realise all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body--how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>so?</b> Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for, and always missed." ...|$|E
