There is often a <b>window</b> <b>period</b> after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional.

25|$|Finally, the Board {{consolidated}} 28 Beck cases under California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224 (1995). The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) {{provided a}} Beck notification to each member yearly via its monthly magazine, and required members to exercise these rights {{once a year}} during a <b>window</b> <b>period.</b> The Board held that the union had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to provide a Beck rights notice to new members and by not providing a Beck rights notice to new members who were resigning from the union but had not yet received the annual notice, but did not commit a ULP by failing to notify resigning union members of their Beck rights {{at the time of}} their resignation. The Board distinguished its holding in California Saw from its prior ruling in Paramax Systems, and found the <b>window</b> <b>period</b> (as well as other restrictions on the submission of resignation and objector status) to be an unfair labor practice. The Board rejected numerous challenges to the way agency fees were calculated, challenges made, and expenditures verified. The California Saw decision was criticized for only applying to nonmembers. The NLRB addressed the Beck rights of members shortly thereafter in United Paperworkers International Union, Local 1033 (Weyerhauser Paper Co.), 320 NLRB 349 (1995). In that case, the NLRB upheld its ruling in California Saw and said that yearly notice to current members, including the rights outlined by the courts and NLRB (not just the statutory language of the NLRA), was all that was required of unions.|$|E

50|$|Antibody tests {{may give}} false {{negative}} (no antibodies were detected {{despite the presence}} of HIV) results during the <b>window</b> <b>period,</b> an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV seroconversion. Most people develop detectable antibodies approximately 30 days after infection, although some seroconvert later. The vast majority of people (97%) have detectable antibodies by three months after HIV infection; a six-month window is extremely rare with modern antibody testing. During the <b>window</b> <b>period,</b> an infected person can transmit HIV to others although their HIV infection may not be detectable with an antibody test. Antiretroviral therapy during the <b>window</b> <b>period</b> can delay the formation of antibodies and extend the <b>window</b> <b>period</b> beyond 12 months. This was not the case with patients that underwent treatment with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Those patients must take ELISA tests at various intervals after the usual 28-day course of treatment, sometimes extending outside of the conservative <b>window</b> <b>period</b> of 6 months. Antibody tests may also yield false negative results in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia; other diagnostic tests should be used in such patients.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{ischemic stroke}} (AIS) {{is a common}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator, the only approved treatment for AIS, is received by less than 2 &#x 0025; of patients. Moreover, there is a slight increase in hemorrhagic complications with thrombolysis. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} newer therapeutic modalities in AIS, which could be used in <b>window</b> <b>periods</b> beyond 3 - 6 h after stroke onset with fewer hemorrhagic complications. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI), after their initial success in patients with acute coronary syndromes, promised much in patients with AIS over the past decade or so.

The current review focuses on the literature concerning the use of GPI in AIS and looks at the available evidence regarding their use. Abciximab thought to be safe and effective in initial case series and early trials, has not been shown to improve outcomes in AIS, and is associated with higher rates of hemorrhage.

40|$|A {{combination}} of measurement and modelling {{was used to}} find a pragmatic solution to estimate the annual total evaporation (ET) from the rare and indigenous Nkazana Peat Swamp Forest (PSF) {{on the east coast}} of Southern Africa to improve the water balance estimates within the area. Total evaporation was measured during three <b>window</b> <b>periods</b> (between seven and nine days each) using an eddy covariance (EC) system on a telescopic mast above the forest canopy. Sapflow of an understory and an emergent tree was measured using a low maintenance heat pulse velocity system for an entire hydrological year (October 2009 to September 2010). An empirical model was derived, describing the relationship between the observed ET of the Nkazana PSF measured during two of the <b>window</b> <b>periods</b> (R 2 = 0. 92 and 0. 90) which, overlapped with sapflow measurements, thereby providing hourly estimates of predicted ET of the Nkazana PSF for a year, totalling 1125 mm (while rainfall was 650 mm). In building the empirical model, it was found that including the understory tree sapflow provided no benefit to the model performance. In addition, the observed emergent tree sapflow relationship with observed ET between the two field campaigns was consistent and could be represented by a single empirical model (R 2 = 0. 90; RMSE = 0. 08 mm). During the <b>window</b> <b>periods</b> of EC measurement, no single meteorological variable was found to describe the Nkazana PSF ET satisfactorily. However, in terms of evaporation models, the hourly FAO 56 Penman–Monteith equation best described the observed ET from EC during the August 2009 (R 2 = 0. 75), November 2009 (R 2 = 0. 85) and March 2010 (R 2 = 0. 76) field campaigns, compared to the Priestley–Taylor model (R 2 = 0. 54, 0. 74 and 0. 62 during the respective field campaigns). From the empirical model of ET and the FAO 56 Penman–Monteith equation, a monthly crop factor (Kc) was derived for the Nkazana PSF providing a method of estimating long-term swamp forest ET from meteorological data. The monthly crop factor indicated two distinct periods. From February to May, it was between 1. 2 and 1. 4 compared with June to January, when the crop factor was 0. 8 to 1. 0. The derived monthly Kc values were verified as accurate (to one significant digit) using historical data measured at the same site, also using EC, from a~previous study. The measurements provided insights into the microclimate within a subtropical peat swamp forest and the contrasting sapflow of emergent and understory trees. They showed that expensive, high maintenance equipment can be used during manageable <b>window</b> <b>periods</b> in conjunction with low maintenance systems, dedicated to individual trees, to derive a model to estimate long-term ET over remote heterogeneous forests. In addition, the contrast in ET and rainfall emphasises the reliance of the Nkazana PSF on groundwater. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In 1985, early tests {{using the}} ELISA method looked for antibodies, {{which are the}} immune system's {{response}} to the virus.
