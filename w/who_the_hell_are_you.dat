2500|$|The Band {{gained a}} {{nickname}} while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss {{as he passed}} the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer. Field Marshal Foch supposedly said 'hoity-toity' (show-off in French) {{in response to the}} drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: [...] "Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we? Riff ramm, goddamn, we're from Division E." [...] It has since evolved over the years.|$|R
