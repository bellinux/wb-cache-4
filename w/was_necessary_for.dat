5|$|A fleet <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> {{the defeat}} of Japan, and {{eventually}} a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{continued}} to shoot animals when it <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> {{the purpose of}} examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life. In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, {{as a gift to}} the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.|$|E

5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> job creation.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> all {{supplies to}} be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, {{moving with the}} column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was {{left behind in the}} inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E

Harisu played Lisu, a murdered pop singer who becomes a vengeful ghost, and also performed the films theme song, though it <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> her dialogue to be spoken in Korean and later dubbed. She was praised by director Bjarne Wong for her hard work and professionalism, and has hinted that they may collaborate on another film in the future.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E

5|$|The storyline {{was also}} criticized by GameBrink.Com for feeling {{secondary}} to the gameplay yet being told in long and numerous cut scenes; their amount was {{compared to that of}} the Xenosaga series.

The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their {{leaders such as}} the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E
