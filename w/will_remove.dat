5|$|In 2012, {{an outfit}} worn by model Karlie Kloss, which was {{reminiscent}} of Native American attire, sparked controversy {{due to its}} alleged stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. Victoria's Secret released a statement of apology shortly after, saying that they <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> it from future advertisements and the broadcast. Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for the outfit and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E

5|$|In chapter 17 of Skáldskaparmál, the jötunn Hrungnir is {{in a rage}} and, while {{attempting}} to catch up and attack Odin on his steed Sleipnir, ends up at the doors to Valhalla. There, the Æsir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> Valhalla {{and take it to}} the land of the jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{leaves the}} table {{only to return}} furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists {{it is not about}} the bill, and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E

5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

5|$|In the Conquest route, the Avatar both {{fights in}} the war against Hoshido, and works with their adoptive family to change Nohr's brutal {{reputation}} from within. After Azura reveals that King Garon has been replaced by an impostor, the Avatar decides to have Garon sit upon the magical throne of Hoshido, which <b>will</b> <b>remove</b> the false Garon's disguise. During the invasion of Hoshido, the Nohrians spare Hinoka and capture Sakura, while Takumi, whose behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent throughout the war, apparently dies by jumping off of a rampart. Garon orders the Avatar to kill Ryoma. After their fight, Ryoma spares the Avatar the pain of killing their own brother by killing himself. Infusing the Yato with the power of Xander and Leo's Legendary Weapons, the Avatar confronts and kills the false Garon. However, a crazed Takumi suddenly appears and attacks them, and it is revealed he has been long dead and his body is possessed. The Avatar destroys Takumi's body to free his soul. Azura overuses her powers as in the Birthright route, but her death is not seen and she is instead marked as missing. In the epilogue, Hinoka is crowned queen of Hoshido and Xander is crowned king of Nohr, and a peaceful alliance between the two kingdoms is formed.|$|E
