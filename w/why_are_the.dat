He became a member in September, and before the year's end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also Annie Besant, a fine orator.|$|E

2500|$|After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin {{to defend}} Hefei, a {{strategic}} location {{at the border}} between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops {{out of the city}} to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders. Zhang Liao said, [...] "Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two of you still hesitating?" [...] Li Dian was moved and he said, [...] "This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can I allow my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?" [...] Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.|$|E

2500|$|When Cao Cao retreated {{after being}} {{defeated}} by Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs {{in the winter}} of 208–209, he left behind Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian with about 7,000 soldiers to guard Hefei (合肥; present-day Hefei, Anhui) from possible attacks by Sun Quan. In around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote, [...] "Open when the enemy comes" [...] on the envelope. Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read, [...] "If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle." [...] They were confused after reading the letter. Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian, [...] "Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation – when the enemy has just arrived and isn't fully gathered yet – to attack them and devastate their morale so we can calm our men and strengthen our defences.
