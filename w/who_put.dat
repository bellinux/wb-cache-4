5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit.

5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E

5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding the house itself. Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903).

5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances of other men <b>who</b> <b>put</b> their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E

In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E

In 1087, Yaropolk was murdered. The circumstances of his murder are not clear, but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich, Prince of Peremyshl, and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich, Prince of Terebovl. His murderer was a man called Neradets, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl; the date given is November 22, 1087.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E

They sent samples to Louisiana, and in June 2002 a representative from Community visited Maraba. Rwandan president Paul Kagame was also present, as the government placed great importance on the project. Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were roasted and blended into one of the company's gourmet coffees.

5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, <b>who</b> <b>put</b> an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.|$|E
