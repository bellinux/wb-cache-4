But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

While redesigning propellers would only garner an extra one or two percent efficiency in operation, changing the materials a propeller is made from has greater effects.

25|$|One of {{the most}} famous finds at Pazyryk is the Pazyryk carpet, which is {{probably}} the oldest surviving pile carpet in the world. It measures 183×200cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 knots per square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was probably manufactured in Armenia or Persia around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|E

The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that [...] "it's nice to see [...] and Lisa getting along so well for once." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and commented that [...] "any football fan will love this episode, but the reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> good {{is the relationship between}} Homer and Lisa. The two truly are a father and daughter to one another, causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] is [...] "a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal, but always amusing, circumstances.

2500|$|American, Latin American and European writers, Jon Lee Anderson, Régis Debray, Jorge G.

Political writer Paul Berman went further, asserting that the [...] "modern-day cult of Che" [...] obscures the work of dissidents and what he believes is a [...] "tremendous social struggle" [...] currently taking place in Cuba. Author Christopher Hitchens, who was a socialist and a supporter of the Cuban revolution in the 1960s but later changed his views, summarised Guevara's legacy by surmising that [...] "Che's iconic status was assured because he failed.

2500|$|Despite its faults, the {{treatise}} remains critically {{successful because}} of its [...] "noble tone," [...] "apt precepts," [...] "judicious attitude," [...] and [...] "historical interests". One of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> unlikely that known ancient critics wrote On the Sublime is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains [...] "personal and fresh," [...] unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices {{as they relate to}} passages as a whole. Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on [...] "greatness of style" [...] than [...] "technical rules." [...] Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a [...] "master of candor and good-nature". Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times. In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.|$|E
2500|$|German {{critics were}} positive. Julia Evers of Oberösterreichische Nachrichten called the film [...] "an oppressive and {{impressive}} moral painting, in which neither the audience nor {{the people in}} the village find an escape valve from the web of authority, hierarchy and violence. [...] Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> difficult to bear." [...] Markus Keuschnigg of Die Presse praised the [...] "sober cinematography" [...] along with the pacing of the narrative. Challenging accusations of Haneke's cinematic approach being cold and cynical, Keuschnigg instead hailed the director as uncompromising and sincerely humanistic. Die Welts Peter Zander compared the film to Haneke's previous works Benny's Video and Funny Games, concluding that while the violence in the previous films had seemed distant and constructed, The White Ribbon demonstrates how it is a part of human society. Zander also applauded the [...] "perfectly cast children", whom he held as [...] "the real stars of this film". In Der Spiegel, Christian Buß opined that the work is [...] "a horror drama, free from horror images", and praised its deviations from conventions of contemporary German cinema, writing that [...] "Haneke forces us to learn how to see again".|$|E

Despite her insistence that Ryan stay away, it is obvious that she still cares for him. Annie crashes the now non-wedding and is stunned to see Greenlee. Ryan lets Greenlee go but remains confident they will get back together one day.
