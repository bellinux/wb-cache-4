5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

25|$|Data {{indicate}} that the diagnosis of BPD is more variable over time than the DSM implies. Substantial percentages (for example around a third, depending on criteria) of people diagnosed with BPD achieve remission {{within a year or}} two. A longitudinal study found that, six years after being diagnosed with BPD, 56 percent showed good psychosocial functioning, compared to 26 percent at baseline. Although vocational achievement was more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders, those whose symptoms had remitted <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a good relationship with a spouse/partner and at least one parent, good work/school performance, a sustained work/school history, good global functioning and good psychosocial functioning.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} gender differences regarding young people {{charged with murder}} in England and Wales. A sample of 318 cases was collected from the Home Office’s Homicide Index and analysed. Of these cases, 93 % of the offenders were male and 7 % female. The analyses explored gender differences {{in terms of the}} offender’s race, offender’s age, victim’s age, victim’s gender, weapon used, offender-victim relationship, and circumstances of the offence. The study found that a female offender <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to murder a family member than a male offender; and a male offender <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to murder a stranger than a female offender.

500|$|The social {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem {{wrote in}} Psychological Review that Bell et al. {{provide the most}} important data concerning [...] "experience-based theories" [...] {{of the development of}} sexual orientation, including [...] "the classical psychoanalytic account", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that [...] "no family variables" [...] are [...] "strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women" [...] is [...] "consistent with accumulating evidence that family variables account for much less of the environmental variance in personality than previously thought". Bem proposed a hypothesis that he refers to as [...] "Exotic becomes erotic": children feel different from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. Bem referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. Bem maintained that Bell′s view that people become erotically attracted to those who are different from them out of a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate.|$|E

2500|$|Other VTTI {{research}} {{based on}} naturalistic driving data {{has demonstrated that}} not all commercial vehicle drivers have an equal likelihood of experiencing “safety-critical events,” i.e., crashes, near-crashes, or high-risk events such as lane deviations. [...] One example is that drivers classified as obese <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be rated as fatigued, {{to be involved in}} a safety-critical event, and to be involved in safety-critical events related to fatigue. Another naturalistic driving study of local and short-haul truck drivers found that 8 of the 42 drivers in the study accounted for 60% of the 77 safety-critical events documented. In progress at VTTI is a case-control study that seeks to differentiate commercial drivers who are involved in a crash from those who are not according to individual and organizational characteristics. This line of research has implications to improve trucking safety by identifying attributes of higher-risk individuals and implementing controls to monitor and improve their safety performance. It can also identify high-risk organizational attributes amenable to changes in safety management practices.|$|E

40|$|Background: Participation {{rates in}} {{colorectal}} cancer screening (CRC) are low. Relatively {{little is known}} about screening uptake across varying levels of risk and across population groups. The purpose of the current study was to identify factors associated with (i) ever receiving colorectal cancer (CRC) testing; (ii) risk-appropriate CRC screening in accordance with guidelines; and (iii) recent colonoscopy screening. Methods: 1592 at-risk persons (aged 56 – 88 years) were randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study (HCS), Australia. Participants self-reported family history of CRC was used to quantify risk in accordance with national screening guidelines. Results: 1117 participants returned a questionnaire; 760 respondents were eligible for screening and analysis. Ever receiving CRC testing <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for persons: aged 65 – 74 years; who had discussed with a doctor their family history of CRC or had ever received screening advice. For respondents “at or slightly above average risk”, guideline-appropriate screening <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for persons: aged 65 – 74 years; with higher household income; and who had ever received screening advice. For respondents at “moderately or potentially high risk”, guideline-appropriate screening <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for persons: with private health insurance and who had discussed their family history of CRC with a doctor. Colonoscopy screening <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> for persons: who had ever smoked; discussed their family history of CRC with a doctor; or had ever received screening advice.
