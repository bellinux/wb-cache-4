The highway progresses eastward as South Main Street, heading through residential homes along the Delaware River. Route 122 makes a large bend around some trees that surround a factory hidden on the Delaware. The highway heads to the southeast, passing through hills and factories and working its <b>way</b> <b>away</b> from the Delaware River. At an intersection with Kent Street, Route 122 makes a gradual bend to the east, passing under Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line, and then paralleling and intersecting with Warren County Route 642 (Carpentersville Road).|$|E
25|$|Another MiG-21 {{trying to}} make its <b>way</b> <b>away</b> from the battle zone was being chased by Avraham Salmon. Having spotted Salmon on his tail, Vladimir Zhuravlev was {{maneuvering}} hard to deny Salmon the opportunity to shoot him down. Salmon had already fired a missile that failed to cause any damage, when Spector's 101 Squadron Mirage joined the fight and fired another pair at the MiG. Although at least one struck home, these too failed to bring the aircraft down, and it continued to fly away to the northwest. Salmon continued to give chase to the vicinity of Helwan, where he managed to close {{the distance to the}} MiG and emptied his cannon into the aircraft. With both his ammunition and fuel exhausted, he departed the scene. Only years later (see below) was it revealed that Zhuravlev's aircraft had in fact crashed and its pilot killed. Spector and Salmon were both credited with a shared kill, the fifth and last of the battle.|$|E
25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the view of what lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his <b>way</b> <b>away</b> from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{unexpected}} defeat by Leeds United {{in the third}} round of the FA Cup, United tried to return to winning <b>ways</b> <b>away</b> at Birmingham. However, United - despite playing well - went behind and only equalised just after an hour through an own goal by Scott Dann. Both teams tried to win the match, but despite late chances for both sides the game ended 1-1 in a match that could have seen United go top had they won.|$|R
500|$|Just as {{the game}} seems to get interesting, Oscar returns and informs {{everyone}} that accounting has been notified to stop payments to vendors. This brings the staff {{out of the game}} and back to the reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back, but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin remarks that Savannah is a long <b>way</b> <b>away,</b> but does so in character; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the [...] "date" [...] was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing, but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her <b>way</b> <b>away</b> from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the sheer}} size of the Ottoman Empire {{jurisdictional}} and government overseeing was not a possibility, since the capitol Istanbul was long <b>ways</b> <b>away.</b> Bosnia was used as a launching state for other wars, which consequently transformed the land into a military occupying region. Most of the peoples along with the Franciscans sought to distance themselves from the Ottoman settlements, many times living in impoverished conditions.

The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place {{assigned}} to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite. Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states: ...|$|E
2500|$|After their disappearance, several expeditions {{tried to}} find their remains and, perhaps, {{determine}} if they had reached the summit. Frank Smythe, when on the 1936 expedition, believed he spotted a body below the place where Irvine's ice axe was found three years earlier, [...] "I was scanning the face from base camp through a high-powered telescope...when I saw something queer in a gully below the scree shelf. Of course {{it was a long}} <b>way</b> <b>away</b> and very small, but I've a six/six eyesight and do not believe it was a rock. This object was at precisely the point where Mallory and Irvine would have fallen had they rolled on over the scree slopes," [...] Smythe {{wrote in a letter to}} Edward Felix Norton. He kept the discovery quiet as he feared press sensationalism, and it was not revealed until 2013, after the letter was found by his son when preparing his biography.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 October, Winx faced a stiffer {{challenge}} in her attempt {{to defend her}} 2015 win in the Cox Plate. Her leading rival was Hartnell, whose form had significantly improved since the two met in August in the Warwick, making him the early favorite for the Melbourne Cup. The field also included several other Group One winners such as Black Heart Bart, Hauraki, Lucia Valentina and Yankee Rose. Bowman placed Winx {{to the outside of}} Hartnell during the early running then released her with 600 metres remaining. Winx moved to a two length lead {{at the top of the}} stretch and continued to draw away, eventually winning by a record eight lengths from Hartnell. It was her thirteenth consecutive win, including nine Group One victories, and took her past Black Caviar and So You Think in career earnings.

50|$|Though arguably {{opposed to}} the shogunate, Satsuma was {{perhaps one of the}} strictest domains in {{enforcing}} particular policies. Christian missionaries were seen as a serious threat {{to the power of the}} daimyo, and the peace and order of the domain; the shogunal ban on Christianity was enforced more strictly and brutally in Satsuma, perhaps, than anywhere else in the archipelago. The ban on smuggling, perhaps unsurprisingly, was not so strictly enforced, as the domain gained significantly from trade performed along its shores, some <b>ways</b> <b>away</b> from Nagasaki, where the shogunate monopolized commerce. In the 1830s, Satsuma used its illegal Okinawa trade to rebuild its finances under Zusho Hirosato.|$|R
