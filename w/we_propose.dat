30|$|In {{this paper}} <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> a mobile robotic cart {{similar to a}} wheeled walker that carries oxygen {{equipment}} to support HOT patients when they go out. <b>We</b> also <b>proposed</b> a new operation interface mechanism employing a rigid handle with several commonly used force sensors and a motion control system. Specifically, for the new operation interface, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> a new mechanical structure and force sensor arrangement that prevent erroneous operation due to grasping, twisting, and leaning on the handle. Then <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> a two-degrees-of-freedom control system whose inputs are the pushing forces of the user and whose outputs are the velocities of the drive wheels of the robotic cart.|$|R

30|$|In this article, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> a {{systematic}} approach to manage resources of femtocell network. For the long-term resource management, we adopt frequency soft reuse to solve spectrum allocation problem between macrocell and femtocell networks. In addition, we enable femtocells dynamically access spectrum allocated to macrocell through CR, which further improves femtocell network capacity and resource utility. For the medium-term resource management, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> the Q-learning-based configuring approach to allocate channel {{and power to}} femtocells. At last, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> a coordinated antenna patterns selection scheme to implement fast resource management for femtocell networks, and make multiple femtocells to cooperate to improve the resource utility and system performance of femtocell networks.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> new {{solutions}} for optimizing {{the selection of}} services on service response time and energy consumption on Web service compositions. <b>We</b> <b>proposed</b> two cases in the optimization: the SLAs free case {{where there is no}} constraint on the maximal service response time and energy consumption and the general case where such constraints are included. In the SLA free case, we showed that in some settings, the problem can be solved by the means of local optimization and dynamic programming. In the general case, <b>we</b> <b>proposed</b> an algorithm that generates an MILP solving the problem. We tested our solutions with multiple simulations that have globally shown that our MILP gives better results than local optimization.|$|R
