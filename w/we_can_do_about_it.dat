25|$|Hartmann {{is also a}} vocal {{critic of}} the effects of {{neoliberal}} globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises' being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs'—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States' traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival of American democracy. This argument is expressed in Hartmann's 2006 book, Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>About</b> <b>It.</b> One of the book's main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media's shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's nothing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, {{and we wanted to}} do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile Upton {{had said}} nothing about his {{discovery}} on the ridge. His first impulse had been to blurt out the news, but on second thought he had decided not to. At the first opportunity he drew Pat aside and told him. The big fellow's face darkened. [...] "Say nothing about it," [...] he counseled. [...] "There's no use in spoiling a merry day, and the knowledge that we are being watched will do them no good. There's nothing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to-day. 'Tis not likely they mean us any harm.

But don't ever think either that capitalists are a peculiar race of fiends, different from anarchists or scrubwomen, or that we'll have a millennium about next election. We've got to be anthropological in our view. It's taken the human race about five hundred thousand years to get where it is, and presumably it will take quite a few thousand more to become scientific or even to understand the need of scientific conduct of everything. I'm not at all sure that there's any higher wisdom than doing a day's work, and hoping the Subway will be a little less crowded next year, and in voting for the best possible man, and then forgetting all the Weltschmertz, and going to an opera. It sounds pretty raw and crude, doesn't it? But living in a world that's raw and crude, {{all you can do is}} to be honest and not worry." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, we {{all know}} that in the matter of public {{appointment}} anything like backstairs influence or indirect canvassing is positively fatal to the success of a candidate. Accordingly, it may surprise you to learn that when Professor Brusegay (who held the appointment virtually in his hands) opened his letters next morning he said to his wife, [...] "Why, Maria, that young fellow Vardon who wrote that astonishingly clever paper on commutators, you know, is tutor at Lady Surrey's, and she wants him to get this place at the Admiralty. We must really see what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Lady Surrey is such a very useful person to know, and besides it's so important to keep on good terms with her, for the Paulsons would be absolutely intolerable if we hadn't its acquaintance in the peerage to play off against their Lord Poodlebury." [...] And when the Professor shortly afterwards mentioned Harry's name to Lord Ardenleigh, his lordship remarked immediately, [...] "Why, bless my soul, that's the very man Amelia wrote to me about. He shall have the place, by all means." [...] And they both wrote back nice little notes to Lady Surrey, to say that she might consider the matter settled, but that she mustn't mention it to Harry until the appointment was regularly announced. Anything so remarkable in this age of purity I for my part have seldom heard of.|$|E
