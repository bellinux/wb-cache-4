5|$|With his dog, Max obtains {{a weapon}} and clothes from a dead Wastelander. Wandering around the desert, Max finds an overzealous, hunchbacked {{mechanic}} named Chumbucket (Jason Spisak) who calls him the Driver. Chumbucket leads Max to Scrotus and the War Boys {{and tells him}} that he built a car, the Magnum Opus, which has a few missing parts; Max agrees to search for them. Max must first liberate Wasteland leaders' territories from the War Boys: Jeet (Josh Keaton), whose stronghold is in an old lighthouse, and Gut Gash (Liam O'Brien), whose followers believe that they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from a flood in their ship stronghold. His stronghold is the remains of an oil tanker. He must penetrate the Jaw, a massive gate protected by War Boys, with the Magnum Opus outfitted with the Thunderpoon (an exploding harpoon). Max and Chumbucket must then save Pink Eye (Adrienne Barbeau), a woman whose mechanical skill rivals Chumbucket's, from an invasion led by Stank Gum—one of Scrotus' Top Dogs—of her silo base.|$|E

5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Norfolk's low-lying {{land and}} easily eroded cliffs, {{many of which}} are chalk and clay, make it {{vulnerable}} to the sea; the most recent major event was the North Sea flood of 1953. The low-lying section of coast between Kelling and Lowestoft Ness in Suffolk is currently managed by the Environment Agency to protect the Broads from sea flooding. Management policy for the North Norfolk coastline is described in the North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan, which was published in 2006 but has yet to be accepted by the local authorities. The Shoreline Management Plan states that the stretch of coast <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> for at least another 50 years, but that in the face of sea level rise and post-glacial lowering of land levels in the South East, there is an urgent need for further research to inform future management decisions, including the possibility that the sea defences may have to be realigned to a more sustainable position. Natural England have contributed some research into the impacts on the environment of various realignment options. The draft report of their research was leaked to the press, who created great anxiety by reporting that Natural England plan to abandon a large section of the Norfolk Broads, villages and farmland to the sea to save the rest of the Norfolk coastline from the impact of climate change.|$|E
