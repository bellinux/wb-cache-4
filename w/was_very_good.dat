5|$|In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was {{established}} {{under the command}} of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good.</b> He further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.|$|E

25|$|The OA vz. 27 was {{the third}} {{in a line of}} Škoda armored cars that used the same revolutionary chassis design. The PA-I {{introduced}} the two driver concept, but it had four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering and a turret with two machine guns. Only two prototypes were built before the army asked for further improvements. The PA-II kept the same chassis, but dropped the turret in a completely new body design with curved plates that mounted a machine gun in each corner of the vehicle. The curved armor <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> ballistically, but was quite expensive to manufacture. Twelve were ordered, but the cramped fighting compartment and lack of space for both gunners to man their weapons simultaneously meant that the army was still not satisfied.|$|E

25|$|Reaction {{from the}} public and critics <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> with ratings {{averaging}} around 7.5 out of 10. Most criticism is of the player designs not resembling the actual people, which is a licensing issue. There is also {{a problem with the}} wicket keeper who doesn't wear a helmet like in many other cricket games. Some other shortcomings include no overthrows and running on overthrow, batsman cannot come down the track to hit or defend, the ball is always thrown to the wicketkeeper rather than at the stumps or to the bowler leaving balls driven to midoff easier to run on, and leaving the ball without playing a shot reduces the batsman's confidence. Batting and bowling averages of players do not evolve with play, unless the player has created a career player.|$|E
25|$|Daw Amar nudges up to Ba Zaw’s {{connection}} to both Saya Chone and Ba Ohn. She states that Ba Zaw <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at painting Traditional Burmese arabesque, {{one of the}} skills which Min Naing claims he learned from Saya Chone. She also mentions that Ba Ohn was the first Burmese painter to illustrate school textbooks, and that when Ba Ohn’s illustrations became outdated, Ba Zaw was hired by Macmillan to illustrate “Burmese Peacock” readers, but she stoutly emphasizes that Ba Zaw accomplished these illustrations on his own, without instruction. She goes on to say, however, that Ba Ohn learned painting techniques from B.H. Wiles (a European painter in Burma who also taught Maung Maung Gyi) and adds that Ba Zaw was also friendly with Wiles. One must wonder if these three painters sometimes kept company, and if Ba Zaw not only learned something from Ba Ohn but also Wiles.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good.</b> Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the match}} got on, Jones and Harmison {{putting on the}} {{pressure}} and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after {{he had failed to}} score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 {{at the end of the}} tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but it mattered little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.|$|E
