5|$|A {{second study}} in 1989 {{indicated}} higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders. The state bought Amtrak's New Haven maintenance facility in May 1989 {{and signed a}} service contract with Amtrak in November. (Metro-North Railroad <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> for several reasons, largely because Amtrak already owned the rail line east of New Haven). Construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in April 1990.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> justifiable in relation to the passenger numbers using the station and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September. Recognising the station's historical significance as a mostly unaltered station from the early 20th century, the station was given Grade II listed building status in 2011.|$|E

5|$|After winning two Five Nations {{games in}} 1992, {{and one in}} 1993, Wales won the Championship in 1994 on points difference. But without {{defeating}} one of Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, during the inter-World Cup period, Wales <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> a major tournament contender. At the 1995 World Cup, after comprehensively beating Japan, Wales lost to New Zealand; this meant {{that they needed to}} defeat Ireland to qualify for the quarter-finals. Wales lost 24–23 and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time, and later that year Kevin Bowring replaced Alex Evans to become Wales' first full-time coach.|$|E
5|$|An {{issue with}} the Hinomaru and {{national}} anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Before the Olympic Games, {{the size of the}} sun disc of the national flag was changed partly because the sun disc <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set the sun disc at two thirds of the flag's length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E

Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.|$|E

The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, gray wolves were {{widespread}} {{in many parts}} of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely because of persecution by farmers.

5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period.

5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> a success.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{with major}} delays hampering the Eurofighter, the Aeronautica Militare began {{a search for}} another interim fighter.

In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States. The Aeronautica Militare returned its Tornado ADVs to the RAF, with the final aircraft arriving at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004. One aircraft was retained for static display purposes.|$|E
