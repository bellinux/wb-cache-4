40|$|Patterns of {{geographic}} variation in 10 morphometric characters were analyzed {{in a sample}} of 91 specimens of the batfish, Ogcocephalus vespertilio (L.), from the NE and SE Brazilian coast, using multivariate statistics and randomization tests. The specimens were ordinated by principal components analysis in two groups corresponding to the regions north and south of the 23 ºC isotherm, and size variation was found to account for 70. 3 %, whereas shape differences accounted for 23. 6 % of the total variation in morphometric characters. The two groups were different at the 1 % significance level by multivariate analysis of variance based on the <b>Wilk's</b> <b>criterion,</b> tested by a randomization procedure. Width of illicial cavity and distance from anus to anal fin were the characters most contributing to the differentiation of the population samples...|$|R

40|$|A {{class of}} {{independent}} multivariate linear models is considered, having a common parameter matrix [Theta] in their means, but having different covariance matrices. For testing H 0 :[Theta] = 0, some test procedures are derived, which combine {{the information from}} the different models. In the context of the interblock analysis of block designs, simulated powers of some combined tests are reported in the bivariate case, for combining the intra- and interblock tests based on the <b>Wilk's</b> [Lambda] <b>criterion.</b> The numerical results indicate that the combined tests offer substantial improvement in power compared to the Wilk's [Lambda] test based only on intrablock information. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and purpose: Treatment of {{refractory}} {{ulcerative colitis}} (UC) {{is a problem}} in the intestinal tract diseases. Different researches have shown that intravenous administration of cyclosporine before surgical operation can be effective. But less is known about the oral administration of cyclosporine given {{at the onset of the}} treatment of refractory UC. In this study effectiveness and side effects of cyclosporine have been evaluated in the severe case of UC. Materials and Methods: Four cases of UC. at severe attack, conformed on the basis of Truelove and <b>wilk</b> <b>criteria</b> were found resistant to steroids, and two patients were dependent to steroids whose disease was not controlled completely and were under our investigation. Two patients received intravenous cyclosporine 4 mg/kg daily for two days and followed by low does of (≤ 5 mg/kg daily) oral administration of cyclosporine. The same low doses of oral cyclosporine were administered in four patients at the onset of treatment. Mean duration of treatment was 15. 5 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated on the basis of frequency of defecation, rectorhalgia and colonoscopic appearance. Blood level of cyclosporine in the, 9, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14 and 18 weeks was measured. All the patients simultaneously received corticosteroides sulfasulazin 5 -ASA, and patients received Azathioprine (6 MP). Results: The severiarity of disease was decreased after intravenous administration of cyclosporine within 2 months, but one of all six patients was recovered after the administration of low dose of oral cyclosporine. On the basis of statistical analysis there was no apparent recovery in the mean score of variants. Finally after 18 weeks three patients were colectomy, and there was no significant response in 2 patients. In four patients there was side effects of sinusitis, gum hyperplasy severe reduction of libido and increase in keratinin in one patient, tremor was observed in 2 patients. Conclusion: In our limited experience,low doses of cyclosporine in controlled standard refractory UC was not effective and was followed by side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a defendable and {{systematic}} uncertainty and sensitivity approach that conforms to the Code Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty (CSAU) process, {{and that could be}} used for a wide variety of software codes, was defined in 2008. The GRS (Gesellschaft für Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit) company of Germany has developed one type of CSAU approach that is particularly well suited for legacy coupled core analysis codes, and a trial version of their commercial software product SUSA (Software for Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses) was acquired on May 12, 2010. This report summarized the results of the initial investigations performed with SUSA, utilizing a typical High Temperature Reactor benchmark (the IAEA CRP- 5 PBMR 400 MW Exercise 2) and the PEBBED-THERMIX suite of codes. The following steps were performed as part of the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis: 1. Eight PEBBED-THERMIX model input parameters were selected for inclusion in the uncertainty study: the total reactor power, inlet gas temperature, decay heat, and the specific heat capability and thermal conductivity of the fuel, pebble bed and reflector graphite. 2. The input parameters variations and probability density functions were specified, and a total of 800 PEBBED-THERMIX model calculations were performed, divided into 4 sets of 100 and 2 sets of 200 Steady State and Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC) transient calculations each. 3. The steady state and DLOFC maximum fuel temperature, as well as the daily pebble fuel load rate data, were supplied to SUSA as model output parameters of interest. The 6 data sets were statistically analyzed to determine the 5 % and 95 % percentile values for each of the 3 output parameters with a 95 % confidence level, and typical statistical indictors were also generated (e. g. Kendall, Pearson and Spearman coefficients). 4. A SUSA sensitivity study was performed to obtain correlation data between the input and output parameters, and to identify the primary contributors to the output data uncertainties. It was found that the uncertainties in the decay heat, pebble bed and reflector thermal conductivities were responsible for the bulk of the propagated uncertainty in the DLOFC maximum fuel temperature. It was also determined that the two standard deviation (2 s) uncertainty on the maximum fuel temperature was between ± 58 oC (3. 6 %) and ± 76 oC (4. 7 %) on a mean value of 1604 oC. These values mostly depended on the selection of the distributions types, and not on the number of model calculations above the required <b>Wilks</b> <b>criteria</b> (a (95 %, 95 %) statement would usually require 93 model runs) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} new integrated uncertainty analysis methodology for "best estimate" thermal hydraulics (TH) codes such as RELAP 5. The main {{thrust of the}} methodology is to utilize all available types of data and information in {{an effective way to}} identify important sources of uncertainty and to assess the magnitude of their impact on the uncertainty of the TH code output measures. The proposed methodology is fully quantitative and uses the Bayesian approach for quantifying the uncertainties in the predictions of TH codes. The methodology also uses the data and information for a more informed and evidence-based ranking and selection of TH phenomena through a modified PIRT method. The modification considers importance of various TH phenomena as well as their uncertainty importance. In identifying and assessing uncertainties, the proposed methodology treats the TH code as a white box, thus explicitly treating internal sub-model uncertainties, and propagation of such model uncertainties through the code structure as well as various input parameters. A The TH code output is further corrected through a Bayesian updating with available experimental data from integrated test facilities. It utilizes the data directly or indirectly related to the code output to account implicitly for missed/screened out sources of uncertainties. The proposed methodology uses an efficient Monte Carlo sampling technique for the propagation of uncertainty using modified <b>Wilks</b> sampling <b>criteria.</b> The methodology is demonstrated on the LOFT facility for 200 % cold leg LBLOCA transient scenario...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{established}} numerical taxonomic strategies {{was applied to}} soil data from three sources: USDA (1975), De Alwis (1971) and the Soil Survey of England and Wales. The first two sources provided data for 41 soil profiles, which were classified without reference to their geographical location. The data obtained from the Soil Survey of England and Wales related to a particular geographical area (West Sussex Coastal Plain) and the geographical relationship between soil individuals was also examined. Two methods of soil characterization (soil profile models) were compared {{with respect to their}} effect on the results produced by two hierarchical agglomerative strategies based on two measures of inter-individual similarity. Comparison of results, obtained from the agglomerative strategies for the two soil profile models, was made. The nature of inter-attribute correlation for depth levels modelled as arrays of independent attributes was examined, and all attributes were classified on the basis of inter-attribute correlation. Seven hierarchical agglomerative strategies were examined with respect to their goodness-of-fit in the original space and also the relationship between goodness-of-fit and clarity of clusters was examined. From these comparisons, two agglomerative strategies were chosen to represent two classes of strategy: (a) strategies with minimum of distortion, (b) strategies with a greater distortion but clear clusters. The average linkage method from the first category and the Ward's error sum of squares (ESS) method from the second category were selected. These two strategies were applied to the data sets described above using two measures of similarity namely (a) squared Euclidean distance and (b) Mahalanobis D 2, and a divisive strategy, REMUL, was also applied to classify the soil populations. The classifications obtained from these strategies were compared by <b>Wilk's</b> <b>Criterion</b> A and the classification which had the lowest A was treated as the best initial partition. The best two partitions of the two populations obtained from the agglomerative strategy, Ward's ESS method, were further analysed. The optimum number of groups (G) in each population was decided by the relationship between LambdaG 2 and G. The soil profile groups produced by these methods were further examined and improved by a reallocation strategy based on the Mahalanobis distance between individuals and the group centroids. Reallocation was done using 30 attributes from the uppermost soil horizons. Canonical analysis was performed on the populations {{both before and after the}} classification. Canonical plots were produced and a comparison was made with the dendrograms obtained for the best partitions. The classifications obtained were examined in relation to parent material classes. The spatial relationship of the soil groups of the West Sussex Coastal Plain was also investigated. As shown by this study, it is possible to produce a better classification of soils by numerical taxonomic methods compared with traditional methods. For this end, it is not necessary to use all attributes of soils, but a sufficiently large number of properties, which can be empirically determined, is adequate for the purpose of producing a natural classification. The soil groups produced by numerical methods showed a closer association with parent materials. <p...|$|R
