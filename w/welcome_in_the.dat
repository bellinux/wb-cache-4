5|$|In 1975, {{after the}} {{assassination}} of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Imelda wanted to extend the official condolences.

Ryan White told the {{commission}} of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease had made him <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Cicero. Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero {{as an example of}} the power and importance of AIDS education.|$|E

5|$|In Oklahoma, {{moisture}} from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98inches (228mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation {{by as much as}} 5 to 10inches (127 to 255mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall lead to 2feet (0.6m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the redevelopment was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how {{after the}} death of Earl Hákon Pálsson, his sons, Haraldr Hákonsson, and Páll Hákonsson, divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began to {{disagree}} with one another, and their vassals divided into competing factions. The saga relates how one day Frakökk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were sewing a snow-white garment embroidered with gold. This garment was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl Páll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful garment and, despite their protestations, put the garment on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl Páll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frakökk and Helga were no longer <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frakökk had an estate. In time, several of Frakökk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland—including her daughter, Steinnvör 'the Stout', and grandson, Ölvir.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E

25|$|By agreement, {{the first}} founder to arrive (circa 893) was Abu 'Abdulla, the Ismaili Da'i or propagandist, who found <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hostility against the Caliphate in Baghdad freely {{expressed}} by the Kotama Berbers. After his success in recruitment and in building the organization, Abu 'Abdulla was ready in 902 to send for 'Ubaidalla Sa'ed, who (after adventures and imprisonment) arrived in 910, proclaimed himself Mahdi, and {{took control of the}} movement. Abu 'Abdulla was killed in a dispute over leadership.|$|E
25|$|When the king's enemies struck, the {{defection}} of Shropshire was {{a critical}} juncture in the rapid collapse that followed. Burley quickly rallied to Thomas FitzAlan, the dispossessed claimant to the earldom, when he returned with Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Adam of Usk's account of the rebels' march through Shropshire makes clear that they met with a <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county and hints at how this shaped the future power structure of the county, with Thomas Arundel, now Archbishop of Canterbury giving ecclesiastical sanction to the new arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The prototype, F.120, {{was used}} as a target {{aircraft}} during anti-aircraft artillery demonstrations on 13 September 1925, fitted with skis in FebruaryMarch 1926 and was handed over for active service on 15 July 1926. F.120 exceeded all expectations as to speed, rate of climb and maximum altitude, leading the way for the manufacture of the remaining three aircraft on order from July 1925. Having been slightly modified from the prototype, the three other aircraft were designated as M.F.9Bs (F.122, F.124 and F.126). At first the M.F.9s received an enthusiastic <b>welcome</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RNNAS, but after a near-fatal spin accident due to a structural breakage in the engine in September 1926 confidence in the aircraft type began to wane.|$|E
