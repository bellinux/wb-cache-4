30|$|A pore {{network model}} {{was used in}} this paper to {{investigate}} the factors, in particular, throat radius, wettability and initial water saturation, causing <b>water</b> <b>block</b> in low permeability reservoirs. A new term — ‘relative permeability number’ (RPN) was firstly defined, and then used to describe the degree of <b>water</b> <b>block.</b> Imbibition process simulations show that the RPN drops in accordance with the extension of the averaged pore throat radius from 0.05 to 1.5 μm, and yet once beyond that point of 1.5 μm, the RPN reaches a higher value, indicating the existence of a critical pore throat radius where <b>water</b> <b>block</b> is the maximum. When the wettability of the samples changes from water-wet to weakly water-wet, weakly gas-wet, or gas(oil)-wet, the gas RPN increases consistently, but this consistency is disturbed by the RPN dropping for weakly water-wet samples for water saturations less than 0.4, which means weakly waterwet media are more easily <b>water</b> <b>blocked</b> than water-wet systems. In the situation where the initial water saturation exceeds 0.05, <b>water</b> <b>block</b> escalates along with an increase in initial water saturation.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} at the Cheshire Oaks designer outlet caused draining {{systems to}} fail, causing flooding inside numerous stores, with {{the roof of}} at least one store partially collapsing inside.

40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” <b>water</b> <b>blocking.</b> To address these new challenges, new <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures.

5000|$|A <b>water</b> <b>block</b> is the watercooling {{equivalent}} of a heatsink. It {{can be used on}} many different computer components, including the central processing unit (CPU), GPU, PPU, and Northbridge chipset on the motherboard. It consists of at least two main parts; the [...] "base", which is the area that makes contact with the device being cooled and is usually manufactured from metals with high thermal conductivity such as aluminum or copper. The second part, the [...] "top" [...] ensures the water is contained safely inside the <b>water</b> <b>block</b> and has connections that allow hosing to connect it with the water cooling loop. The top can be made of the same metal as the base, transparent Perspex, Delrin, Nylon, or HDPE. Most newer high-end <b>water</b> <b>blocks</b> also contain mid-plates which serve to add jet tubes, nozzles, and other flow altering devices.The base, top, and mid-plate(s) are sealed together to form a [...] "block" [...] with some sort of path for water to flow through. The ends of the path have inlet/outlet connectors for the tubing that connects it {{to the rest of the}} watercooling system. Early designs included spiral, zig-zag pattern or heatsink like fins to allow the largest possible surface area for heat to transfer from the device being cooled to the water. These designs generally were used because the conjecture was that maximum flow was required for high performance. Trial and error and the evolution of <b>water</b> <b>block</b> design has shown that trading flow for turbulence can often improve performance. The Storm series of <b>water</b> <b>blocks</b> is an example of this. Its jet tube mid plate and cupped base design makes it more restrictive to the flow of water than early maze designs but the increased turbulence results in a large increase in performance. Newer designs include [...] "pin" [...] style blocks, [...] "jet cup" [...] blocks, further refined maze designs, micro-fin designs, and variations on these designs. Increasingly restrictive designs have only been possible because of increases in maximum head pressure of commercially viable water pumps.|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>blocking</b> damage, {{caused by}} the {{invasion}} of external fluids into the coal seams during hydraulic fracturing, {{is one of the}} reasons causing coalbed methane wells uneconomic in most areas of China. This paper presents an experimental study of <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> damage on coal based on the measurements of surface tension, contact angle, gas-phase permeabilities and adsorption and desorption of nitrogen on synthetic coal samples. Distilled water, KCl, AN, and KCl+AN solutions were used as testing liquids in this study. Results show that the hydraulic fracturing fluid with surfactant AN causes the lowest damage to the reservoir permeability; the surfactant AN reduces the surface tension of the liquid and increases the wettability of liquid to coal reservoir; and the surfactant AN inhibits the occurrence of capillary and Jamin effects efficiently. It is concluded that the surfactant AN can reduce the <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> damage rates of coal reservoirs; and the hydraulic fracturing fluid mixed with 1. 5 % KCl and 0. 05 % AN reduces the effect of <b>water</b> <b>blocking</b> damage on the coal permeability...|$|E
