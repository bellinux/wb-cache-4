60|$|Jake did {{not appear}} {{disposed}} to join in any conversation since dinner.

60|$|Gudrun {{sat down}} in silence. Her mouth was shut close, her face averted. She <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> bitterly that she had ever come back. Ursula looked at her, and thought how amazingly {{beautiful}} she was, flushed with discomfiture. But she caused a constraint over Ursula's nature, a certain weariness. Ursula wished to be alone, freed from the tightness, the enclosure of Gudrun's presence.|$|E
60|$|The breakfast passed off in silence, {{for each}} of the party was {{brooding}} over his, or her, own personal grievances. Mrs. Pott <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> the loss of a beau; Mr. Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the INDEPENDENT; Mr. Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation. Noon approached, and after many adieux and promises to return, he tore himself away.|$|E

A study he conducted in 1994 found that specific actions people wish they hadn't taken <b>are</b> <b>regretted</b> more in the short run, but ultimately, inactions <b>are</b> <b>regretted</b> more in the long run. He has continued to emphasize that people tend to regret the things they don't do more than the things they did.|$|R
60|$|Already Mrs Verloc <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> her words. They {{had sounded}} more unkind than she meant them to be. They had also the unwisdom of {{unnecessary}} things. In fact, {{she had not}} meant them at all. It {{was a sort of}} phrase that is suggested by the demon of perverse inspiration. But she knew a way to make it as if it had not been.|$|E

"They {{have got}} quite a start of us," [...] Bob said, after they {{had been on the}} road a few moments, and while Ralph <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> the absence of a comb, which would enable him to feel so much more comfortable, [...] "but I do not think your horses have had any grain since they stole them, and if that is so, I don't think we shall have any trouble in {{overtaking}} them within an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Elizabeth, [...] "I {{have been}} rather too much {{used to the}} game to be soon {{overcome}} by a gentleman's hints. However, when I found how excessively he <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together. They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so pleasantly. Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect." ...|$|E

60|$|Sensation in court. The prisoner, {{who seemed}} to feel his {{position}} deeply, cast a pop-eyed glance full of gratitude at his advocate. Mr. Bunbury, in his capacity of prosecuting attorney, ran {{his fingers through his}} hair in some embarrassment, for he <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> now that he had made such a fuss. Miss Hobson thus assailed by an underling, spun round and dropped the lip-stick, which was neatly retrieved by the assiduous Mr. Cracknell. Mr. Cracknell had his limitations, but he was rather good at picking up lip-sticks.|$|E
60|$|Joan, meantime, intrenched {{behind her}} magazine, was also busy with her thoughts. She was not reading the magazine; {{she held it}} before her as a protection, knowing that if she laid it down Ashe would begin to talk. And just at present she had no desire for conversation. She, like Ashe, was contemplating the {{immediate}} future, but, unlike him, was not doing so with much pleasure. She <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> heartily {{that she had not}} resisted the temptation to uplift this young man and wishing that she had left him to wallow in the slothful peace in which she had found him.|$|E
60|$|A slow flush crept over Wally's face. He made no reply, {{and there}} fell between them a silence {{that was like}} a shadow, Jill sipped her coffee miserably. She <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> that little spurt of temper. She wished she could have {{recalled}} the words. Not that it was the actual words that had torn asunder this gossamer thing, the friendship which they had begun to weave like some fragile web: it was her manner, the manner of the princess rebuking an underling. She knew that, if she had struck him, she could not have offended Wally more deeply. There are some men whose ebullient natures enable them to rise unscathed from the worst snub. Wally, her intuition told her, was not that kind of man.|$|E

[...] "There is no {{necessity}} {{for you to}} look outside your own immediate surroundings to see beautiful things, unless you choose deliberately to make your life an ugly thing. With us it is different--with us who work for a living, who dwell in the cities, and who have no power to push back the wheels of life. If we are presumptuous enough to wish to take into our lives anything of the beautiful, anything to help us fight our daily battle against the commonplace, we have to create it for ourselves. That is why I am here just now, and why I <b>was</b> <b>regretting,</b> when I heard your footstep, that one finds {{it so hard to}} be alone." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{set before}} them that day a dinner than which a better no prince commanded, unless {{it were the}} Pope. There were ortolans, shot in the valley, done with truffles, that made the epicurean Gonzaga roll his eyes, {{translated}} {{through the medium of}} his palate into a very paradise of sensual delight. There was a hare, trapped on the hillside, and stewed in Malmsey, of a flavour so delicate that Gonzaga <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> him his heavy indulgence in the ortolans; there was trout, fresh caught in the stream below, and a wondrous pasty that turned liquid in the mouth. To wash down these good things there was stout red wine of Puglia and more delicate Malvasia, for in his provisioning of the fortress Gonzaga had contrived that, at least, they should not go thirsty.|$|E
6000|$|And having {{perceived}} that much he presently began to doubt whether she realized {{anything of the}} sort. Her letters fluctuated very much in tone, but at times they were as detached and guarded as a schoolgirl writing to a cousin. Then it seemed to Benham an extraordinary fraud on her part that she should presume to come into his dream with an entirely deceptive closeness and confidence. She began to sound him in these latter letters upon the possibility of divorce. This, {{which he had been}} quite disposed to concede in London, now struck him as an outrageous suggestion. He wrote to ask her why, and she responded exasperatingly that she thought it was [...] "better." [...] But, again, why better? It is remarkable that although his mind had habituated itself to the idea that Easton was her lover in London, her thought of being divorced, no doubt to marry again, filled him with jealous rage. She asked him to take the blame in the divorce proceedings. There, again, he found himself ungenerous. He did not want to do that. Why should he do that? As a matter of fact he was by no means reconciled to the price he had paid for his Research Magnificent; he regretted his Amanda acutely. He <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> her with a regret that grew when by all the rules of life it ought to be diminishing.|$|E

60|$|The {{scientific}} {{and the general}} members of the expedition are arriving very fast. Dr. Markham, the geographer of the expedition, has long been here. Mr. Holmes, of the British Museum, arrived yesterday, as archæologist; he is going off to-morrow to a church a few miles distant, to examine some manuscripts said to exist there. The Dutch officers arrive up to-day, and I hear two French officers arrive to-morrow. In reference to these foreign officers, I am assured to-day by a staff-officer, to whom I <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> that more was not done for them, {{that they are not}} really commissioners. It may be so; but as, at any rate, they are officers who are paid by foreign governments, and are allowed to accompany the expedition, I confess that I am unable to see any essential difference. The staff-officer assured me, as a proof of the beneficent intentions of the authorities, that these foreign officers would not be charged for their rations. John Bull is indeed liberal. He is much more sharp as to the “specials;” for a general order was actually issued the other day, saying that “gentlemen unconnected with the army were to pay for a month’s rations in advance.” With the exception of the scientific men, who are all sent out by Government, and must, I suppose, be considered official persons, there are only four gentlemen here “unconnected with the army,” namely, three other special correspondents and myself. I remarked to a commissariat-officer, with a smile, when called upon to pay my month in advance, that “I thought I might have been considered as good for the payment {{at the end of each}} month as officers were.” “Ah,” said the astute officer, “but suppose anything were to happen to you, whom should we look to for payment?” The reply was obvious: “But, on the other hand, suppose that unpleasant contingency should occur, of whom are my representatives to claim the amount for the days paid for but not eaten?” At whose suggestion this general order was issued I know not; but I do know that anything more paltry and more unworthy the general order of a large army was never issued. Who issued this order I know not, for I cannot but repeat that no one could be more kind and considerate than are Sir Robert Napier and every member of his staff to all of us.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MISS MONROE, - I am ill {{in bed and}} stupid, incoherently stupid; yet I have {{to answer}} your letter, and {{if the answer is}} incomprehensible you must forgive me. You say my letter caused you pleasure; I am sure, as it fell out, not near so much as yours has brought to me. The {{interest}} taken in an author is fragile: his next book, or your next year of culture, might see the interest frosted or outgrown; and himself, in spite of all, you might probably find the most distasteful person upon earth. My case is different. I have bad health, am often condemned to silence for days together - was so once for six weeks, so that my voice was awful to hear when I first used it, like the whisper of a shadow - have outlived all my chief pleasures, which were active and adventurous, and ran in the open air: and being a person who prefers life to art, and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in love, or to risk a danger, than to paint the finest picture or write the noblest book, I begin to regard what remains to me of my life as very shadowy. From a variety of reasons, I am ashamed to confess I was much in this humour when your letter came. I had a good many troubles; <b>was</b> <b>regretting</b> a high average of sins; had been recently reminded that I had outlived some friends, and wondering if I had not outlived some friendships; and had just, while boasting of better health, been struck down again by my haunting enemy, an enemy who was exciting at first, but has now, by the iteration of his strokes, become merely annoying and inexpressibly irksome. Can you fancy that to a person drawing towards the elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather aching sense of the past and the future? Well, it was just then that your letter and your photograph were brought to me in bed; and there came to me at once the most agreeable sense of triumph. My books were still young; my words had their good health and could go about the world and make themselves welcome; and even (in a shadowy and distant sense) make something in the nature of friends for the sheer hulk that stays at home and bites his pen over the manuscripts. It amused me very much to remember that I had been in Chicago, not so many years ago, in my proper person; where I had failed to awaken much remark, except from the ticket collector; and to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows that I now send instead of me, and how these are welcome in that quarter to the sitter of Herr Platz, while their author was not very welcome even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a meal and rather failed.|$|E
