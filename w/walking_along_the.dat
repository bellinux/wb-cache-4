5|$|At Survivor Series 1993, Owen Hart was {{eliminated}} during a elimination match when he crashed into his brother Bret Hart, who was <b>walking</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> ring apron, causing Owen {{to lose his}} focus and be pinned by Michaels.

This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for <b>walking</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men <b>walking</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E
