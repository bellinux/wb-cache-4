5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display is made <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> raised high and {{differs from that}} of the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|House sparrows sleep <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> tucked {{underneath}} the scapular feathers. Outside of the reproductive season, they often roost communally in trees or shrubs. Much communal chirping occurs {{before and after}} the birds settle in the roost in the evening, as well as before the birds leave the roost in the morning. Some congregating sites separate from the roost may be visited by the birds prior to settling in for the night.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis is territorial, {{defending}} the nesting and display sites against intruders. Agonistic or threat displays include lunging forward <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> in a horizontal posture, and standing upright and snapping the bill opposite another bird {{engaging in the}} same display. Birds also lunge and bite, often holding onto an opponent's head or wings.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E

5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that}} it was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton {{became the}} first, and to date, only player to die {{as a result}} of {{injuries}} suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets, and starting in the 1979–80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league wear them.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told {{they were going to}} play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would {{benefit of the}} people of the Potteries, that a differential rating system for a fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide a course of action should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This last point was important because without it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E

5|$|With these changes, {{a special}} session of the {{legislature}} met August 5 until August 20 in Oregon City. On August 11, 1845 at the introduction of Jesse Applegate the body passed a law against dueling within a half hour that Governor Abernethy also signed within 30 minutes of the bill's introduction. A new legislature met beginning on December 2, with Robert Newell serving as {{the speaker of the}} body through December 10 and Henry A. G. Lee assuming the post until the conclusion of the session on December 19. Polk District was created during the session, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> passed on December 19. John E.

5|$|Based on {{conflicting}} political, {{religious and}} social positions, the English Civil War was fought between {{the supporters of}} Parliament and those of King Charles I, known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed. After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament {{and could not be}} suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed {{in the face of the}} monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of the second series {{attracted}} the highest all-time rating of HolbyBlue, with 5.62 million viewers watching the episode, making the episode the twelfth most-watched programme on the channel for the week of its broadcast. However, the following episode saw {{a decline in the}} ratings for HolbyBlue after it clashed with ITV's police drama The Bill, <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> recording 5.4 million viewers and a 23% audience share, compared to HolbyBlue 4.1 million viewers and 18% audience share. Episode three was watched by 3.8 million viewers, attaining an 18% audience share, again beaten in its timeslot by The Bill. Episodes four and five were watched by 3.5 and 3.4 million viewers respectively; both episodes were again beaten by The Bill, and while episode six saw a slight rise in viewership to 3.6 million, The Bill lengthened its lead against HolbyBlue, attaining a 23% audience share, compared to HolbyBlue 16%. By episode eight, HolbyBlue had fallen to 3.2 million viewers. It maintained its 16% share, as opposed to The Bill increased audience share, to 26%. With its ninth episode, the series fell even further, to 2.9 million viewers, while its audience share again decreased, this time to 14%. Episodes ten and eleven were watched by 2.8 and 2.6 million viewers respectively, with viewership declining to 2.5 million {{by the time of the}} series' cancellation.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E
