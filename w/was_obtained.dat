Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E
