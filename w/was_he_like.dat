6000|$|... "I've met men of that description, and I'm rather prejudiced {{in their}} favor," [...] {{declared}} Millicent, smiling. [...] "But what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> in person--slightly rugged?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> mistress?' said Hugh with {{a glance}} at young Willet, so slight and {{momentary}} that the scowl it conveyed was lost on all but her. 'About my height?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. He passed us yesterday, when I was {{out with}} Zillah. But he never spoke. What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> Do, pray tell me--what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> like?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... like {{used in many}} sentences; usually {{every other}} word, e.g. [...] "like, <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> on aboot me or like, summat, like?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "¿Y cómo es él?" [...] (Spanish for And what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?)</b> <b>is</b> a song {{composed}} in 1981 by José Luis Perales and released in 1982.|$|R
6000|$|... 18 Nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> those stars which, only shine, [...] When to pale mariners they storms portend: [...] He had his calmer influence, and his mien [...] Did {{love and}} majesty {{together}} blend.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Lige listened, and {{he shifted}} {{from one foot}} to the other, and rubbed his hands, which were red. Some odd trick of the mind had put into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme. <b>Was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> them? ...|$|E
60|$|She {{remembered a}} very brown face, a tall slim figure, and {{something}} gallant {{about the whole}} of him. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> after ten years? Grizzled, married, with a large family? An odious thing--Time! And Cousin Edward's little yellow letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] said Sir Edward promptly, [...] "we'll {{invite him}} here. Lady Atherly {{can bring in}} some people to see him. Is he--ahem--What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> The usual American, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did n't {{you hear}} him? 'Mademoiselle, you almost satisfy my {{conception}} of the beautiful. I must model your bust.' That almost should <b>be</b> rewarded. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> me; <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> to face the truth. I think we should get on together." ...|$|R

60|$|EDITH. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> this husband? like to thee? Call not {{for help}} from me. I knew him not. He lies not here: not close beside the standard. Here fell the truest, manliest hearts of England. Go further hence and find him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Man {{with a flat}} face," [...] said Dirk anxiously, as he slit away at the {{stitches}} of {{the saddle}} to find the letter; [...] "tell me about him. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> and {{what makes you think}} he wished to take the paper from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Where she {{was most}} vulnerable, he hurt her. Oh, {{where she was}} {{delivered}} over to him, in her very soft femaleness, he seemed to lacerate her and desecrate her. She pressed {{her hands over her}} womb in anguish, whilst the tears ran down her face. And why, and why? Why <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The obvious line's {{not always}} best," [...] Carrie interposed. [...] "My notion is, it's a foolish habit {{to take it}} for granted your {{antagonist}} is a cheat. But what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> Jim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{service to}} him, too! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> his sister. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> very <b>like</b> his sister. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> devilish <b>like</b> his sister," [...] says Mr. George, laying {{a great and}} not {{altogether}} complimentary stress on his last adjective.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't. Chatterjee doesn't sink {{his money}} in railway companies, or {{sit down and}} provide for the proper {{sanitation}} of his own city, or of his own notion cultivate the graces of life, as the Jap does. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the Tokio Public Opinion--'purely political.' He has no art whatever, he has no weapons, {{and there is no}} power of manual labour in him. Yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the Jap in the pathos of his politics. Have you ever studied Pathetic Politics? Why <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> the Jap?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed as}} though the fellow must have {{realized}} {{that we would have}} no compunction about taking his life in cold blood if so be he stood between us and liberty, yet <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> the wild-cat, ready and willing to struggle to the very last even though the odds were so heavy against him, and when we strove to carry him into the loft he did his best to prevent it, although both hands and feet were bound securely.|$|E
6000|$|And Vivien {{breaking}} in upon him, said: [...] 'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks, [...] Thy tongue has tript a little: ask thyself. [...] The lady never made unwilling war [...] With those fine eyes: {{she had her}} pleasure in it, [...] And made her good man jealous with good cause. [...] And lived there neither dame nor damsel then [...] Wroth at a lover's loss? were all as tame, [...] I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair? [...] Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes, [...] Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink, [...] Or make her paler with a poisoned rose? [...] Well, those were not our days: but did they find [...] A wizard? Tell me, <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> to thee? ...|$|E
6000|$|James G. Ward was {{forty years}} of age, a {{successful}} business man, and very unhappy. For forty years he had vainly tried {{to solve a problem}} that was really himself and that with increasing years became more and more a woeful affliction. In himself he was two men, and, chronologically speaking, these men were several thousand years or so apart. He had studied the question of dual personality probably more profoundly than any half dozen of the leading specialists in that intricate and mysterious psychological field. In himself he was a different case from any that had been recorded. Even the most fanciful flights of the fiction-writers had not quite hit upon him. He was not a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> the unfortunate young man in Kipling's [...] "Greatest Story in the World." [...] His two personalities were so mixed that they were practically aware of themselves and of each other all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "My child! my child!" [...] {{the countess}} cried. [...] "Alive and here! My God, I thank thee that thou hast remembered a friendless mother at last. Have you seen him, Jeanne? What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> Oh, tell me everything!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom Hill, who {{laughs at}} Cares and Woes, [...] As nauci--nili--pili-- [...] What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>like,</b> as I suppose? [...] Why, to be sure, a Rose--a Rose. [...] At least, no soul that Tom Hill knows [...] Could e'er recall a Li-ly.|$|R
6000|$|... 2. Tennyson. Give a brief {{sketch of}} Tennyson's life, and name his chief works. Why <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> <b>like</b> Chaucer, a {{national}} poet? Is your pleasure in reading Tennyson due chiefly to the thought or the melody of expression? Note this figure in [...] "The Lotos Eaters": ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} we shall escape it, if we stop short at the text. We must go on from the Old Testament and let the New explain it. We must believe what Moses tells us: but we must ask St. John to show us more than Moses saw. Moses tells us that God created the heavens and the earth; St. John goes further, and tells us what that God is like; how he saw Christ, the Word of God, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made. And what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> He was the {{brightness}} of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person. And what was that like? was there any darkness in him--meanness, grudging, cruelty, changeableness, deceit? No. He was full of grace and truth. Grace and truth: that is what Christ is; and therefore that is what God is.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt the}} need of being alone; he was {{conscious}} of a vague distrust of himself, which degraded him in his own estimation. <b>Was</b> <b>he,</b> <b>like</b> characters he had read of in books, {{the victim of a}} fatality? The slightest circumstances conspired to heighten his interest in Sally--just at the time when Regina had once more disappointed him. He was as firmly convinced, {{as if he had been}} the strictest moralist living, that it was an insult to Regina, and an insult to his own self-respect, to set the lost creature whom he had rescued in any light of comparison with the young lady who was one day to be his wife. And yet, try as he might to drive her out, Sally kept her place in his thoughts. There was, apparently, some innate depravity in him. If a looking-glass had been handed to him at that moment, he would have been ashamed to look himself in the face.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{and what}} <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> {{and what were}} my {{impressions}} concerning him? He {{was a man of}} about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather emaciated figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes hollow; his features were pleasing and regular, they had a French turn (for M. Pelet was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth and parentage), yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments was, in his case, softened by a mild blue eye, and a melancholy, almost suffering, expression of countenance; his physiognomy was [...] "fine et spirituelle." [...] I use two French words because they define better than any English terms the species of intelligence with which his features were imbued. He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing personage. I wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary characteristics of his profession, and almost feared he could not be stern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster. Externally at least M. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master, Edward Crimsworth.|$|E

6000|$|LIEUTENANT. <b>Like!</b> <b>He's</b> like--well, {{you ought}} to have just seen the fellow: that will give you a notion of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> won't <b>be</b> <b>like</b> it five minutes after I catch him; for I tell you that if ever-- ...|$|R
25|$|Soon {{afterward}} Goltz gave up {{that position}} {{and became a}} military aide to the essentially powerless Sultan Mehmed V. Baron von der Goltz did not get along {{with the head of}} the German mission to Turkey, Otto Liman von Sanders, nor <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> by the real power in the Ottoman Government, Enver Pasha.|$|R
6000|$|But now her own words, not his, were {{ringing in}} her head--women do {{not so easily}} cease to love, they suffer. In spite of the new creed she had so eagerly and {{fiercely}} embraced, {{in which she had}} sought deliverance and retribution, did she still love Ditmar, and suffer because of him? She repudiated the suggestion, yet it persisted as she glanced at Rolfe's red lips and compared him with Ditmar. Love! Rolfe might call it what he would--the life-force, attraction between the sexes, but it was proving stronger than causes and beliefs. He too was making love to her; like Ditmar, he wanted her to use and fling away when he should grow weary. Was he not pleading for himself rather than for the human cause he professed? taking advantage of her ignorance and desperation, of her craving for new experience and knowledge? The suspicion sickened her. Were all men like that? Suddenly, without apparent premeditation or connection, the thought of the stranger from Silliston entered her mind. <b>Was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like</b> that?... Rolfe was bending toward her across the table, solicitously. [...] "What's the matter?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} face upward to the parasol of the great pine, closed his eyes, and {{in a short time}} forgot his sombre fancies. January though it was, the mild stillness seemed to vibrate with faint midsummer sounds. Rowland sat {{listening}} to them and wishing that, {{for the sake of his}} own felicity, Roderick's temper were graced with a certain absent ductility. He was brilliant, but <b>was</b> <b>he,</b> <b>like</b> many brilliant things, brittle? Suddenly, to his musing sense, the soft atmospheric hum was overscored with distincter sounds. He heard voices beyond a mass of shrubbery, at the turn of a neighboring path. In a moment one of them began to seem familiar, and an instant later a large white poodle emerged into view. He was slowly followed by his mistress. Miss Light paused a moment on seeing Rowland and his companion; but, though the former perceived that he was recognized, she made no bow. Presently she walked directly toward him. He rose and was on the point of waking Roderick, but she laid her finger on her lips and motioned him to forbear. She stood a moment looking at Roderick's handsome slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} either, son, so cannot say. But what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>like?</b> Oh, I cannot say that either, {{although}} still I {{see him in}} my heart. My mortal lips will not tell the likeness of that man, perhaps because {{he seemed to be}} like all men, and yet different from all. He had an iron brow, beneath which shone deep, cold eyes. He was clean-shaven, or perchance his face grew no hair. His lips were thick and still and his features did not change like those of other men. He looked as though he could not change; as though he had been thus for infinite ages, and yet remained neither young nor old. As for his dress, he wore a cloak of flaming red, such a cloak as your Eve loves to wear, and white sandals on his feet. There was no covering on his shaven head, which gleamed like a skull. His breast was naked, but across it hung one row of black jewels. From the sheen of them I think they must have been pearls, which are sometimes found of that colour in the East. He had no weapon nor staff, and his hands hung down {{on either side of the}} chair.|$|E
50|$|Saizou/Ninja Blue (Saizō/Ninja Burū) is a {{descendant}} of Kirigakure Saizo. 22 years old, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> constantly chattering and an easily flattered man who thinks he's a lot smarter than <b>he</b> really <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> to help other people, making him popular among children. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> unlucky in most things and His way of talking is a little feminine.
