The airlanding anti-tank battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.|$|E
25|$|Since then a {{great variety}} of {{purchases}} have been made. During the 19th century the works were almost exclusively by Danish artists, and for this reason the Museum has an unrivalled collection of paintings from the so-called Danish Golden Age. That the country was able to produce pictures of high artistic quality <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> and a consequence of the establishment of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1754.|$|E
25|$|As a {{lover of}} Woman and Nature Winther is {{perhaps one of the}} Danish authors who is most closely {{connected}} to the concept of a romantic poet. Many later Danish lyrics have been inspired by his verses. His special ability of making Nature accompanying the action and his elegant and, compared with his time, rather sensual tributes to women <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> Through The Stag's Flight, his main work, he has won the name of “The Singer of Zealand”.|$|E

25|$|The Russian abacus {{was brought}} to France around 1820 by the {{mathematician}} Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in Napoleon's army and had been {{a prisoner of war}} in Russia. The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid. The Turks and the Armenian people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a coulba by the Turks and a choreb by the Armenians.|$|E
25|$|DreamWorks began {{production}} in 2001, which was actually {{before the first}} film was even completed. DreamWorks made sure there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to see in Shrek 2 by putting more human characters in the film than there were in its predecessor and improving their appearance, {{with the use of}} a few systems that dealt with hair and fur to improve its appearance and movement. The set up for all the characters was done in the first three years of production. Puss in Boots required a whole new set of tools in the film to handle his fur, belt and feather plume in his hat. The character also required an upgrade in the fur shader for his introduction in the film.|$|E
500|$|The role of Nellie Forbush was {{the first}} time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a belter, rather than a lyric soprano like Laurey in Oklahoma! and Julie in Carousel. According to Mordden, [...] "Nellie <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> in R, {{carrying}} a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice".|$|E

500|$|... "He trained us for films at {{the same}} time that he was {{training}} himself," [...] recalled Agnes Moorehead. [...] "Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors. That <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> in Hollywood: nobody seemed interested in bringing in a group to rehearse before scenes were shot. But Orson knew it was necessary, and we rehearsed every sequence before it was shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{oversaw the}} designs of sets and costumes, and he {{directed}} the performers on stage. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity. Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre. As Jessie Bond wrote later: ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} reels {{were taken to}} Madras, {{thousands}} of people gathered at the city's central railway station and followed the reel box along Wall Tax Road to Kinema Central, throwing rose petals, breaking open coconuts, and burning incense. The posters of the film read, Tamil Telugu pesi paadu padam (...) [...] An earlier attempt at producing a Tamil sound film, a four-reel short (identified by S. Theodore Baskaran as Korathi Dance and Songs), was screened alongside Kalidas as a side attraction. It starred Rajalakshmi, and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai. In a 2015 interview with The Times of India, Rajalakshmi's daughter Kamala stated that during the film's release, [...] "people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for {{a distance of about}} 4-5km to witness [...] acting in her first pesum padam. She was welcomed with a roar here. Her name was announced from speakers installed on roads and autorickshaws, as a talkie <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> for the people." ...|$|E

500|$|Chopra {{said she}} studied method acting {{to make her}} {{character}} seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, [...] "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry". [...] Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, [...] "It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come up to my character in the film are {{not because of the}} profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life". Ranaut said, [...] "In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E
2500|$|Ventura's {{entertaining}} commentary {{style was}} {{an extension of}} his wrestling persona, i.e. a [...] "heel", as he was partial to the villains, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> and different at the time. McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, {{came up with the}} idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly favored the fan favorites.|$|E
2500|$|In 1830, Hirsch {{was elected}} chief rabbi (Landesrabbiner) of the principality of Oldenburg. During this period, {{he wrote his}} Neunzehn Briefe über Judenthum, (Nineteen Letters on Judaism) which were published, under the {{pseudonym}} of [...] "Ben Usiel" [...] (or [...] "Uziel"), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> — a brilliant, intellectual presentation of Orthodox Judaism in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances.|$|E

2500|$|He {{enjoyed his}} {{greatest}} success after impresario Mitch Miller, {{who became the}} A man at Mercury in 1948, recognized a universal quality in his voice {{that led to a}} succession of chart-topping popular songs, often with a folk or western flavor. Laine and Miller became a formidable hit-making team whose first collaboration, [...] "That Lucky Old Sun", became the number one song in the country three weeks after its release. It was also Laine's fifth Gold record. [...] "That Lucky Old Sun" [...] <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to the musical scene in 1949: a folk spiritual which, as interpreted by Laine, became both an affirmation of faith and a working man's wish to bring his earthly sufferings to an end.|$|E
2500|$|In 1808 Gallatin {{proposed}} a dramatic $20 million program of internal improvements—that is, roads and canals along the Atlantic seacoast {{and across the}} Appalachian mountain barrier to be financed by the federal government. This <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> and many considered it outright unconstitutional. It {{was rejected by the}} [...] "Old Republican" [...] faction of his party that deeply distrusted the national government, and anyway there was no money to pay for it. Most of Gallatin's proposals were eventually carried out years later, but this was done not by the concerted federal action he proposed, but by local governmental and private action. Though often wasteful, this method enlisted local and private energies in large enterprises. While not a pacifist, he strongly opposed building up a navy and endorsed Jefferson's scheme of using small gunboats to protect major ports. The plan failed in the War of 1812 as the British, unhindered, landed behind the harbors.|$|E
2500|$|His {{approach}} <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> There {{had been}} criticisms of Shakespeare before, but either {{they were not}} comprehensive or they were not aimed at the general reading public. As Ralph Wardle put it, before Hazlitt wrote this book, [...] "no one had ever attempted a comprehensive study of all of Shakespeare, play by play, that readers could read and reread with pleasure {{as a guide to}} their understanding and appreciation". Somewhat loosely organised, and even rambling, the studies offer personal appreciations of the plays that are unashamedly enthusiastic. Hazlitt does not present a measured account of the plays' strengths and weaknesses, as did Dr. Johnson, or view them in terms of a [...] "mystical" [...] theory, as Hazlitt thought his contemporary A.W. Schlegel did (though he approves of many of Schlegel's judgements and quotes him liberally). Without apology, he addresses his readers as fellow lovers of Shakespeare and shares with them the beauties of what he thought the finest passages of the plays he liked best.|$|E

2500|$|Externally it was {{unremarkable}} (illustration, right), but the classicising domed hall {{surrounded by}} galleried aisles and apsidal ends, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> in assembly rooms, and brought its architect immediate celebrity. The design was {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy, private commissions followed, and {{at the age of}} 26 Wyatt found himself a fashionable domestic architect and on 27 August 1770 an Associate of the Royal Academy. His polished manners secured him friends as well as patrons among the great, and when it was rumoured {{that he was about to}} leave the country to become architect to Catherine II of Russia, a group of English noblemen is said to have offered him a retaining fee of £1,200 to remain in their service. His major neoclassical country houses include Heaton Hall near Manchester (1772), Heveningham Hall in Suffolk (circa 1788-99), [...] and Castle Coole in Ireland, as well as Packington Hall in Staffordshire, the home of the Levett family for generations, and Dodington Park in Gloucestershire for the Codrington family. On 15 February 1785 Wyatt was elected an Academician of the Royal Academy, his diploma work being a drawing of the Darnley Mausoleum.|$|E
2500|$|Needing a new {{car because}} of the high profile of Ward's Packard, they found {{traveling}} salesman Merle Collison sleeping in his Buick along the highway outside Douglas, Wyoming. After Collison was awakened, he was shot. Starkweather later accused Fugate of performing a coup-de-grace after his shotgun jammed. Starkweather claimed Fugate was the [...] "most trigger happy person" [...] he had ever met. The salesman's car had a push-pedal emergency brake, which <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> to Starkweather. While attempting to drive away, the car stalled. He tried to restart the engine and a passing motorist stopped to help. Starkweather threatened him with the rifle, and an altercation ensued. At that moment, a deputy sheriff arrived on the scene.

[...] Starkweather tried to evade the police, exceeding speeds of [...] A bullet shattered the windshield and flying glass cut Starkweather deep enough to cause bleeding.
