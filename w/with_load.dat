Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out. Self-discharging ships use conveyor belts <b>with</b> <b>load</b> rates of around 1,000tons per hour.|$|E

25|$|The G class {{featured}} imported General Motors-Electro-Motive Division technology (prime mover, alternator and traction motors) on {{a locally}} designed frame and body. Major advances introduced {{with the class}} included cab air conditioning, onboard toilet, Trimount type high adhesion bogies, and Super Series wheel creep control to enable heavier loads to be hauled. The locomotives were designed to be of minimum mass, allowing a higher fuel load. The body consists of two side trusses <b>with</b> <b>load</b> bearing supports, roofbows and integral cabs. The side panels are made of fibreglass for the minimum weight, with various accessories mounted in removable roof hatches.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant will}} need to import 4.72million tons of coal per year. This massive freight will need about 59 ships each having 80,000-ton {{capacity}} that would {{be taken to the}} port {{on the bank of the}} Poshur river. The 40 kilometres from the port to the plant cuts through the Sundarbans and it includes the river flow path. Environmentalists say these coal-carrying vehicles are not often covered as they scatter large amounts of fly ash, coal dust and sulphur, and other toxic chemicals are released throughout the life of the project. Carrying large amount of coal through the shallow rivers also pose a threat as five vessels <b>with</b> <b>load</b> of coal, oil and potash sank in the nearby rivers from the time period of December 2014 to January 2017.|$|E

In just ten days, Almeida made 16 captures and while he continued at the rate of the four-month campaign, those waters gave huge profits. Among the prizes were the brig San Antonio de Padua, captured on January 28, 1817 with a cargo of sugar, snuff, and silk scarves (burned); the schooner New Catalina; the brig San Antonio Abad (February 19), of Veracruz and in ballast, that was burned; the brig Paz on February 24 on a trip from Sisal to Havana; the brig San Jose from Campeche to Havana with cargo of brandy and wine; and the schooners Mary and Squirrel (<b>with</b> <b>load</b> of sarsaparilla and $2,000, burned).|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} a {{constant}} force generator is the constant-force spring. [...] An {{example of a}} practical constant velocity generator is a lightly loaded powerful machine, such as a motor, driving a belt. [...] This is analogous to a real voltage source, such as a battery, which remains near constant-voltage <b>with</b> <b>load</b> provided that the load resistance {{is much higher than}} the battery internal resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{steam engines}} did not supply power at a {{constant}} enough load for many continuous applications ranging from cotton spinning to rolling mills, restricting their power source to water. [...] Advances in steam engines such as the Corliss steam engine {{and the development of}} control theory led to more constant engine speeds, which made steam power useful for sensitive tasks such as cotton spinning. [...] AC motors, which run at constant speed even <b>with</b> <b>load</b> variations, were well suited to such processes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was also progressively fitted with improved engines. At {{first it was}} equipped with the Klimov M-100, a license-built version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine, but this was soon replaced by the more powerful M-100A, and from 1938 by the yet more powerful M-103. While the engine installation of the SB 2-M103 initially retained the drag inducing frontal radiators of the M-100 powered aircraft, an improved engine installation was developed with the radiators slung under the engines. On 2 September 1937 M.Yu. Alexeev set an official altitude record of [...] <b>with</b> <b>load</b> of [...] in an M-103 powered SB. He had earlier set an unofficial record of [...]|$|E
40|$|From the {{analysis}} of experimentally observed variations in surface strains <b>with</b> <b>loading</b> in reinforced concrete beams, {{it is noted that}} there is a need to consider the evolution of strains (<b>with</b> <b>loading)</b> as a stochastic process. Use of Markov Chains for modeling stochastic evolution of strains <b>with</b> <b>loading</b> in reinforced concrete flexural beams is studied in this paper. A simple, yet practically useful, bi-level homogeneous Gaussian Markov Chain (BLHGMC) model is proposed for determining the state of strain in reinforced concrete beams. The BLHGMC model will be useful for predicting behavior/response of reinforced concrete beams leading to more rational design...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to lighting, electric motors (analogous to generators operating in reverse, or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work) became {{extremely important to}} industry. Speed control of early DC motors limited their use. [...] Frank J. Sprague developed the first successful DC motor (ca. 1886) by solving the problem of varying speed <b>with</b> <b>load.</b> [...] Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways. In 1888, a Serbian immigrant, Nikola Tesla, a former employee of Edison's, patented an AC induction motor and licensed it to the Westinghouse Corporation. Electric motors eventually replaced steam engines in factories around the nation as they required neither complex mechanical transmissions from a central engine nor water sources for steam boilers in order to operate.|$|E
