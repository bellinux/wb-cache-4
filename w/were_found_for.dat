5|$|The Prospect Park Zoo {{closed to}} the public in June 1988. Over the next six months, new homes <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the {{displaced}} animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built. The facilities were turned over to the NY Zoological Society in April 1993.|$|E

40|$|Six field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Giza Agricultural Research Station, Egypt during 2010, 2011 and 2012 growing seasons to study the effect of two types of N fertilizers (urea and urea form as slow-release (UF)) on intercropping cowpea with sunflower and intercropping wheat with pea. A split plot design with three replications was used. The results indicated that insignificant effect of cropping systems <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> sunflower and significant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. Significant effect of N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on sunflower and insignificant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. Furthermore, insignificant effect of interaction of cropping systems and N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> sunflower and significant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. With respect to wheat and pea intercropping, both crops were significantly affected by intercropping system. Significant effect of N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on wheat and insignificant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> pea yield. Both wheat and pea were significantly affected by the interaction of cropping system and N fertilizers. Yield advantage was achieved because land equivalent ratio exceeded 1. 00. Dominance analysis proved that leguminous crop is dominated component. Thus, the studied intercropping systems could be recommended to farmers due to its beneficial returns...|$|R

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, the British amateur {{palaeontologist}} Reginald W. Hooley described {{two more}} specimens of O. latidens, {{collected from the}} sea after a rock fall near Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight in 1904. The first of these, NHMUK R3877, was collected as three blocks and consists of a skull, neck and trunk vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an ischium, {{and parts of the}} forelimbs. The second specimen, NHMUK R3878, was collected in one block, and includes parts of the pectoral girdle and forelimbs. These specimens represent the most complete remains of Cretaceous pterosaurs found in England, and NHMUK R3877 was one of the only known three-dimensionally preserved pterosaur skeletons for much of the 20th century (pterosaurs bones are often flattened compression fossils). Hooley discussed O. latidens in detail, and placed the genus Ornithodesmus in its own family, Ornithodesmidae. His article ended with a discussion wherein it was noted that the palaeontologist Charles William Andrews had expressed doubts as to whether O. latidens belonged in the genus Ornithodesmus, as the vertebrae of the specimen that genus was based on differed markedly from those of Hooley's specimen. The American palaeontologist Samuel W. Williston subsequently reviewed Hooley's article, disagreeing with some of his conclusions about the anatomy and classification of the animal. After Hooley's monograph, little was written about the animal {{for the rest of the}} 20th century, and no similar pterosaurs <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> decades.|$|E

25|$|The Commission {{found that}} an average of 40% of school-aged {{children}} were infected with hookworm. Areas {{with higher levels of}} hookworm infection prior to the eradication program experienced greater increases in school enrollment, attendance, and literacy after the intervention. Econometric studies have shown that this effect cannot be explained by a variety of alternative factors, including differential trends across areas, changing crop prices, shifts in certain educational and health policies and the effect of malaria eradication. No significant contemporaneous results <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower (prior) infection rates. The program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Division.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} test {{would allow}} for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment.

The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds. For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194nm photons.|$|E

25|$|Earlier on, McGinness had met a grazier, Fergus McMaster, when McMaster's car axle {{had broken}} down on a bed in Cloncurry River. McGinness fixed the car, gaining the respect of McMaster. McGinness and Fysh headed off to Brisbane, further {{developing}} their plan along the way. Coincidentally, McMaster also went to Brisbane. Upon realising this, Fysh and McGinness, explained their airline plans to him. The initial plans for the airline service consisted of joyriding, air taxi trips and charter services spanning the Northern Territory Western Queensland region of Australia. As a result, on 20 June 1920 in Brisbane's Gresham Hotel, McGinness, Fysh, McMaster and Alan Campbell, an adviser for the Queensland Primary Producers, began to register the new airline company. The registration of the company was not finalised that day. It took several months before a name and the necessary funds <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the business.|$|E

25|$|On Monday, the Air National Guard {{and those}} at Keesler Air Force Base airlifted {{patients}} to Jackson and other more inland locations. Volunteers searched for those injured and dead, {{as well as}} helping refugees. When many of the evacuees returned by Tuesday, Governor John Bell Williams declared martial law, blocking highways into the area and leading to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The governor also opened Camp Shelby, dormitories within the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Robert E. Lee Hotel to serve as shelters for those who lost homes. Sections of Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian were evacuated. Survivors <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> days after the storm, with 35 trapped by high water north of Bay St. Louis rescued on Thursday. Army engineers disposed of 25 tons of dead animals, mostly cows, during the week following Camille. One week after the storm, Keesler-based air planes sprayed malathion at low altitudes to kill the thriving insect population. Martial law would be lifted on 27 August. The federal and state military presence would continue for several weeks. During the evening of 8 September, President Nixon visited the Biloxi-Gulfport Regional Airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storm's aftermath. During the rebuilding process, stricter building codes were enforced by local governments. In 1973, hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to Keesler Air Force Base when their previous headquarters at Ramey, Puerto Rico, closed.|$|E
