500|$|When the {{subtropical}} ridge {{in the northwest}} Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a <b>wet</b> <b>monsoon</b> season for Asia. [...] The {{subtropical ridge}} position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. [...] The subtropical ridge across North America typically migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September. [...] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When the high pressure moves south, its circulation cuts off the moisture and the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing {{a break in the}} monsoon regime.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1944, several crashes {{occurred}} in the Far East. At first, it was thought these were {{as a result of}} wing structure failures.

An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that [...] "the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the <b>wet</b> <b>monsoon</b> season". However a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford, which found faults in six Mosquito marks (all built at de Havilland's Hatfield and Leavesden plants). The defects were similar, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack. Thus the investigators concluded that there were construction defects at the two plants.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) anomalies over the Indian and Pacific Oceans (domain 25 °S to 25 °N and 40 °E to 160 °W) {{during the three}} seasons following the Indian summer <b>monsoon</b> for <b>wet</b> <b>monsoons</b> and also for dry monsoons accompanied or not by El Niño. A dry monsoon is followed by positive SST anomalies in the longitude belt 40 to 120 °E, negative anomalies in 120 to 160 °E and again positive anomalies east of 160 °E. In dry monsoons accompanied by El Niño the anomalies have the same sign, but are much stronger. <b>Wet</b> <b>monsoons</b> have weak anomalies of opposite sign in {{all three of the}} longitude belts. Thus El Niño and a dry monsoon have the same types of association with the Indian and Pacific Ocean SSTs. In the sector 40 to 120 °E SST anomalies first appear over {{the western part of the}} Indian Ocean (June to September) followed by the same sign of anomalies over its eastern part and China Sea (October to March). By March after a dry monsoon or El Niño the Indian Ocean between 10 °N and 10 °S has a spatially large warm SST anomaly. Anomalies in deep convection tend to follow the SST anomalies, with warm SST anomalies producing positive convection anomalies around the seasonal location of the intertropical convergence zone.

50|$|Botanically the pindan forms a {{transitional}} zone between the <b>wetter</b> <b>monsoon</b> {{forests of the}} north Kimberley and the Great Sandy Desert to the south-east, exhibiting a mix of monsoonal and arid species. Structurally it is a low and open woodland of scattered trees, dominated by wattles, with eucalypts and tall shrubs. The understorey contains grasses and herbs. During the long dry season from April to November the annual plants and grasses die off, the country looks parched, and regular wildfires leave stretches of bare and blackened soil, studded with dead shrubs. During the short wet season from December to March there is profuse flowering of the diverse pindan flora, {{with a wide variety}} of insects and other animals taking advantage of the seasonal abundance.|$|R

40|$|The interannual {{variability}} in the southwest U. S. monsoon {{and its relationship to}} sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is investigated via experiments conducted with the University of California, Los Angeles, atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). When the model is run without interannual variations in SSTs at the lower boundary, the simulation of the climatological mean monsoon is quite similar to the observed. In addition, the interannual precipitation variance and <b>wet</b> minus dry <b>monsoon</b> composite differences in the pre-cipitation and monsoon circulation are largely realistic. When interannual variations in SSTs are introduced, the simulated interannual precipitation variance over the southwest U. S. monsoon region does not increase. Nor do SSTs seem to be important in selecting for <b>wet</b> or dry <b>monsoons</b> in this simulation, as there is little correspondence between observed <b>wet</b> and dry <b>monsoon</b> years and simulated wet and dry years. These results were confirmed through a 20 -member ensemble of shorter seasonal simulations forced by an SST anomaly field corresponding to that observed for a wet minus dry southwest U. S. monsoon composite. When the AGCM is coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, the pattern of SST anomalies generated in association with <b>wet</b> and dry <b>monsoons</b> is remarkably similar to that observed: there is a large area of positiv...|$|R
40|$|Pedogenic carbonates in a 19 m-thick dune section (16 R) at Didwana, {{and several}} shorter {{profiles}} {{from the eastern}} margin of the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, were studied for their stable isotope composition. Carbon isotope results show the C 4 biomass (grasses?) has dominated local vegetation {{for most of the}} 250, 000 years represented by the 16 R section. Our results display a decrease in δ 18 O and δ 13 C values during the last interglacial and early glacial periods. The higher δ 13 C values in our dune records correlate to episodes in the strong upwelling and decreased sedimentation rates in Indian Ocean cores, probably the result of a strong Asian Monsoon. The high δ 13 C values may, therefore, denote the expansion of C 4 vegetation in response to warm, <b>wetter</b> <b>monsoon</b> circulation. Conversely, low δ 18 O and δ 13 C values mark the expansion of C 3 vegetation, probably caused by enhanced winter rains and lower temperatures...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{drainable}} surplus of an irrigated area, a methodology {{based on a}} groundwater-balance approach was developed and applied in Schedule I-B of the Fourth Drainage Project near Faisalabad in Pakistan. To determine the seasonal net recharge in this area, a numerical groundwater model was run in inverse mode. The data input for the model consisted of the geometry of the aquifer system, the aquifer parameters, and historical watertable elevations. The seasonal net recharge values, calculated from the individual recharge and discharge components, were "tuned" {{with the results of}} the inverse modelling. The advantage of such an integrated approach is that all these components are linked. The design net recharge was estimated from the historical net recharge of the <b>wettest</b> <b>monsoon</b> in the study period. Its rainfall recharge values were then substituted for those of a design monsoon. In this substitution procedure, the rainfall recharge methodology and parameters were adopted from the tuning procedure. From this design net recharge, estimates could be made of the required drainable surplus, with and without drainage simulation...|$|R

50|$|In {{temperate}} and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons {{are generally}} recognized: spring, summer, autumn or fall, and winter.

Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, <b>wet,</b> or <b>monsoon</b> {{season and the}} dry season. Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season.
