5|$|If it {{is unclear}} <b>what</b> <b>counts</b> as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values {{can play a role}} ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of <b>what</b> <b>counts</b> as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E

The majority provided three main arguments in support of its reasoning: that their interpretation is more in line with the text of the First Amendment, that it better served the First Amendment's purpose of limiting political patronage, and that such an interpretation will not significantly burden employers.|$|E

Mugula was drawn in the second heat on 2 August, finishing fifth out of eight swimmers, with a time of 27.58 seconds.

Overall he finished 53rd out of 58 swimmers, and was unable to advance to the semi-finals after being 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who progressed to the later stages. After the event Mugula said: [...] "I felt this time I was fitter. I think psychologically I put too much pressure on myself. But it's OK, I'm not disappointed.
