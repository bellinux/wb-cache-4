40|$|This study {{examines}} the physiological impacts of live-release angling tournament practices on <b>walleyes</b> Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum). Blood and white muscle samples {{were taken from}} <b>walleyes</b> following the weigh-in at several live-release angling tournaments in southern Ontario. The tournament <b>walleyes</b> had significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels in comparison {{with those of the}} control <b>walleyes,</b> indicating that tournament practices elicit a significant stress response in the tournament fish. Increased creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities revealed that <b>walleyes</b> experience a moderate degree of cellular damage during live-release angling tournaments. In contrast to recent research with largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, the tournament <b>walleyes</b> showed evidence of plasma ion loss. The tournament <b>walleyes</b> also experienced dramatic reductions in white muscle energy stores (phosphocreatine, ATP, and glycogen) and corresponding increases in plasma and white muscle lactate levels when compared with those of the control fish. These metabolic changes were similar in magnitude to the changes previously observed in largemouth bass following tournaments and suggest that current tournament procedures may commonly cause relatively large bouts of anaerobic metabolism in fish...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{physiological}} disturbances in <b>walleyes</b> Sander vitreus that occurred during the different phases of a live-release angling tournament. To achieve this, we took blood and white muscle samples from <b>walleyes</b> during experiments that simulated different aspects of a live-release tournament (angling, live-well confinement, and weigh-in procedure). In accordance with recent findings for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, the physiological disturbance experienced by tournament <b>walleyes</b> results mainly from two distinct bouts of anaerobic metabolism occurring during angling and the weigh-in procedure. These periods are characterized by large increases in white muscle and plasma lactate concentrations, reductions in white muscle ATP, phosphocreatine, and glycogen and a significant cardiac disturbance.

5|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} are popular outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and hunting contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include <b>walleye</b> in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia opossum, gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit.

5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 <b>Walleye</b> II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of acclimation water temperature, live-well (LW) water temperature, and LW dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on survival of adult <b>Walleyes</b> Sander vitreus subjected to simulated tournament conditions (angling, LW confinement, and weigh-in procedures) under controlled laboratory conditions. We tested three acclimation temperatures (12, 18, and 24 ◦C), and three LWtemperature differentials (Delta T=− 4, 0, and + 4 ◦C) were tested at each acclimation temperature. Survival was monitored after 8 h of LW confinement and during a 5 -d retention period in 1, 700 -L tanks. None of the <b>Walleyes</b> that were acclimated to 24 ◦C and subjected to simulated tournament procedures survived the 5 -d retention period; for fish subjected only to simulated angling at 24 ◦C, survival during the 5 -d retention period was 29 %. Five-day survival was generally over 70 % at acclimation temperatures of 12 ◦C and 18 ◦C, and we observed a significant interaction between acclimation temperature and Delta T; survival was greatest in LWs at − 4 ◦C Delta T for fish acclimated to 18 ◦C and in LWs at + 4 ◦C Delta T for fish acclimated to 12 ◦C. Best survival of <b>Walleyes</b> subjected to the stress of angling and tournament procedures was obtained at temperatures 6 – 8 ◦Cbelow the optimum temperature for adult <b>Walleyes</b> (i. e., optimum = 20 – 22 ◦C). Five-day survival exceeded 70 % when LW DO was 5 or 12 – 15 mg/L (at an acclimation and LW temperature of 18 ◦C), but survival was 0 % when DO was 2 mg/L. Anglers may increase survival of <b>Walleyes</b> through careful manipulation of LW temperature and DO when ambient temperature is at or below 18 ◦C, but high mortality of angled and LW-retained <b>Walleyes</b> should be expected when ambient water temperatures are 24 ◦C or greater...|$|R
40|$|Twelve <b>walleyes</b> (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) were tagged {{with radio}} {{transmitters}} between 13 March and 26 April 1976 in the tailwater area of lock and dam 7. The {{objectives of the}} study were to determine the <b>walleye's</b> homing ability, behavior patterns, range, diel activity patterns and reaction to increasing water levels. Three <b>walleyes</b> were displaced a minimum of 10 km from the capture site and all exhibited homing behavior as defined by Crowe (1962). The <b>walleyes</b> in the tailwater area were located in 15 separate areas that were classified as either eddies or backwaters. The fishes were located in eddies 39 % of the tracking hours and in backwater areas 52. 7 % of the tracking hours. Only 8. 3 % of the hours were spent travelling in the main channel. Two types of swimming patterns became recognizable. Random swimming was defined as movement having either no specific direction of travel, a slow rate of travel (10 - 300 m/hr) or the fish traversing small distances 127 m/movement). Directional swimming was characterized by rapid movement between study areas (300 - 1200 m/hr), usually in relatively straight lines and the fish traveled farther (547 m/movement). The <b>walleyes</b> rested (no movement) twice as much time as was spent swimming. They rested more at night than during the day; however, when they were active, they were more active during the night. The fishes showed four distinct modes in activity during the night. The fishes showed four distinct modes in activity at 0230, 0630, 1130 and 1830 hours with the highest peak at 0230 hours. There were diel habitat preferences where location in backwater areas would peak between 2100 and 0300 hours and eddy location would peak between 2100 and 0300 hours and eddy location would peak between 0900 and 1500 hours. During the study period the walleyres ranged upstream to Lock and Dam 6 and downstream to Lock and Dam 8, a minimum distance of 56. 3 km.

40|$|Abstract. —Sauger Sander canadensis populations {{throughout}} North America have exhibited declines {{over the}} past few decades. Various factors may be contribute to the reduced population abundance of saugers in the middle Missouri River of Montana, including interspecific competition with <b>walleyes</b> Sander vitreus. We compared the seasonal migrations, habitat use, and diets of both species in the middle Missouri River to assess competition potential. Before the presumed spawning period, 96 % of saugers and 57 % of <b>walleyes</b> migrated as far as 264 kilometers downstream. After spawning, both species returned to previously occupied river reaches and demonstrated site fidelity during the nonmigratory season. Habitat use by saugers and <b>walleyes</b> was similar at three hierarchical spatial scales. Diet overlap was high during the spring and summer and moderate during autumn. Resource overlap of saugers and <b>walleyes</b> in the middle Missouri River of Montana suggests that the competition potential between these species is high, which may preclude the recovery of native sauger populations where resources are limiting.

25|$|Intensive {{exploitation}} of lake resources and habitat destruction resulted in marked decrease in fish production so that commercial operations were halted and recreational fishing is presently limited {{to catch and}} release. Years of construction activity on the lake's limited watershed resulted in lowered water levels. Heavy metals (aluminium, chromium, arsenic, and copper) dissolved in the water {{as a result of}} coal burning were deemed to be at acceptable levels, but metals in sediment and mercury in larger pike were found to be excessive. TransAlta responded with measures to reduce metal and thermal pollution, and the Wabamun power plant was decommissioned and torn down. As a result of the Canadian National Railway oil spill, fish from the lake are not recommended for consumption. <b>Walleye</b> have not been seen in the lake since the early 1900s when they were fished out. Several attempts to restock <b>walleye</b> in the lake failed because the Wabamun power plant (built in the 1950s) discharged its heated cooling water into the lake, keeping that portion of the lake clear of ice. <b>Walleye</b> would spawn in the warm water weeks prior to their normal spawning time and the hatchlings did not survive when they could not find enough food in the still-cold portions of the lake. After closure of the Wabamun power plant in 2010, Alberta Fish and Wildlife attempted another stocking of <b>walleye,</b> and this one appears to have been successful. <b>Walleye</b> are reproducing and so are their young.
