40|$|The {{vegetable}} tannins are {{the oldest}} tanning agents used in leather industry. They give their natural character and colour to the leathers {{which they are}} applied to, but they have the disadvantage of colour change when {{they are exposed to}} light for prolonged times. In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes. Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins. From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties. When chemical properties of leathers tanned with modified quebracho and mimosa are considered: volatile matter, sulphated total ash and sulphated water- insoluble ash, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, hide substance and formaldehyde contents were found compatible with standard mimosa and quebracho.

30|$|In a study {{combining}} {{in vitro}} manipulation with mesocosm and field experiments, Fenner and Freeman (2011) observed that dry periods stimulate bacterial growth and enzymatic degradation {{of organic matter}} in peat lands and subsequent re-wetting enhances carbon losses to receiving waters. In the region representing this study, although extreme weather events are not common, seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation could similarly influence organic matter and microbial activity in the sub-catchment. Possibly for this reason, river DOC was highest in July indicating the first flush effect. We found enhanced microbial activity and a corresponding rise in <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WSOC) in response to atmospheric AD-OC input over time along the study gradient. As observed in present study, increased microbial activity in soil enhances the production of dissolved organic carbon (Kalbitz et al. 2000, 2007). It seemed that the consistently rising runoff DOC observed in this study has an important link to microbial processing of organic matter in dry seasons followed by pulsed response and subsequent lateral flow in rainy season (Fenner and Freeman 2011; Ritson et al. 2014). Elevated inputs of OC may further enhance microbial activity and pulsed responses to rainfall (Sponseller 2007). Although long-term studies are required to confirm this issue, our data clearly indicate increasing AD-OC linked soil stimulation as a possible mechanism addressing causative relationship of rising DOC in land surface runoff. This highlights a need for additional research into AD driven changes in catchment processes considering other factors potentially operating at smaller scales especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains.|$|R

Schiller argued that unless we look to the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since [...] "Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes", without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics [...] "1+1=2" [...] and points out that this equation does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the contextualist view in contemporary epistemology as well as the views of ordinary language philosophers.

We compared the patterns of annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration in the organic and mineral soil layers of the two forests with literature data for < 100 years old deciduous and coniferous forests from different climatic zones. Carbon and N inputs, with aboveground litter fall, were significantly higher in the Black pine than in the Black locust stand. In the soil profile of the Black pine stand, the amount of SOC was significantly higher and that of SON significantly lower than in the Black locust stand. The average annual sequestration rates were 41. 3 and 75. 0 g C m- 2, and 2. 9 and 2. 6 g N m- 2, respectively, in the Black locust and the Black pine stands. In both forests most of SOC and SON was stored in the organic layers (OL and OF+OH).

Biomass burning produces a continuum of pyrogenic organic matter (Py-OM) with unique chemical functionality dependent on temperature and the parent plant material. Spectroscopic analysis of lab produced Py-OM and pyrogenic <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (Py-WSOM) indicates that the Py-WSOM extracted from low temperature chars (200 - 650 ?) is dominated by carbon associated with polar functionality (-OH and C-O), most likely derived from the depolymerization and defragmentation of lignocellulose. Incubation experiments under aerobic conditions with unsterilized river water suggests that PyWSOM and associated pyrogenic biomarkers have turnover rates {{on the order of}} weeks to months, consistent with mixing and transport timescales for riverine systems. Therefore, the export of Py-WSOM from the aquatic system and its impacts on regional and global level carbon cycling may be heavily influenced by low-mid combustion temperature PyC. This study will aid in understanding the solubilization, degradation, and sequestration of terrestrial organic carbon in light of thermal alteration and vegetation replacement. Texas coastal wetlands are dynamic tidal zones that have historically been dominated by salt marshes.

As estimated, among the newly discovered chemical entities nearly 40 % drugs are poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble.</b> To get proper therapeutic level of drug in plasma, a high dose of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs is required. The orally administered drugs show its complete pharmacological effect if it is fairly <b>soluble</b> in <b>water</b> in gastric medium and such drugs show good bioavailability. The enhancement of oral bioavailability of such poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs remains one of the most challenging aspects of drug development. Various methods are used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs in aqueous medium. In this present study, surfactant micellization method was used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs viz. glibenclamide, clofibrate. A carbohydrate based non-ionic surfactants, which was synthesized in lab, were explored to encapsulate these drugs. It was found that the water solubility of these drugs increased up to many folds. Key Words: poor <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs, bioavailability, carbohydrate non-ionic surfactant, clofibrate, glibenclamide, micellizatio...|$|R
40|$|The vestibulo oculomotor reflex (nystagmus) was {{recorded}} {{by means of}} electronystagmography in 33 neurosurgical patients in dynamics prior to and after ventriculography. For contrasting the ventricular system a <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> medium (Conrey, dimer X or Amipak) was used in 18 patients and contrast mixtures of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> agents in combination with Myodil emulsion in 15. It was established that after ventriculography with <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> media the trunk vestibular reactions in all types of nystagmus grew frequently and sharply and the vestibulovegetative reactions increased markedly...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of functional biomimetic <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> polymers with a defined secondary structure has been developed using β-sheet polyisocyanopeptide scaffolds. <b>Water</b> <b>soluble</b> isocyanopolymers were prepared by random copolymerisation of the azido functionalized isocyanopeptides with nonfunctionalised methyl ester isocyanides derived from alanine. Upon saponification of the latter function a rigid rod <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> polymer was obtained with an accessible azide for postfunctionalization. The potential of these biomimetic polymers was successfully demonstrated by using the click chemistry reaction of these polymers with an acetylene functionalised rhodamine dye...|$|R

The formation of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> inclusion complexes {{with a variety}} of small, hydrophobic guest molecules is also described. Moreover, when these guest molecules are drug moieties, then the resulting drug/dendrimer complexes can be considered ideal candidates for use as novel drug delivery systems...|$|R

The extraction of caffeine from <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> materials, especially instant tea, is {{more suitable for}} an organic chemistry teaching laboratory than the classic experiment using tea leaves, due to the economy of time and a larger amount of extracted caffeine. The procedure is time-saving and requires only a four-hour period. The experiments illustrate the extraction process as used in undergraduate organic chemistry laboratories...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} play crucial {{roles in}} cellular processes {{and are often}} important pharmacological drug targets. The hydrophobic properties of these proteins make full structural and functional characterization challenging {{because of the need}} to use detergents or other solubilizing agents when extracting them from their native lipid membranes. To aid membrane protein research, new methodologies are required to allow these proteins to be expressed and purified cheaply, easily, in high yield and to provide <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> proteins for subsequent study. This mini review focuses on the relatively new area of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> membrane proteins and in particular two innovative approaches: the redesign of membrane proteins to yield <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> variants and how adding solubilizing fusion proteins can help to overcome these challenges. This review also looks at naturally occurring membrane proteins, which are able to exist as stable, functional, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> assemblies with no alteration to their native sequence...|$|R
