40|$|Objectives: With {{advancing}} age {{the incidence}} of falls and thereby morbidity goes on increasing. One important aspect of increase in {{the incidence of}} these mishaps may be the effect of age on reaction time. Background: Hence, the present study was undertaken to study the effect of advancing age on auditory, visual and <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>times.</b> Method: 120 Normal healthy male subjects were distributed in four groups according to age and their Audio-Visual and <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>time</b> were found out with the help of Audio-Visual reaction <b>time</b> apparatus, <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>time</b> apparatus and Digital chronoscope. Results: Assessed by using “ANOVA” single factor analysis test. It was found that audio-visual reaction <b>time</b> and <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>time</b> increases as the age advances and delayed average audio-visual and <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>time</b> is significantly different among different age groups. Effect of ageing on the myelination of neurones may be the possible cause for this observation. Conclusion: Delayed Audio-Visual and <b>whole</b> body reaction <b>time</b> in these subjects suggests that that they should be more cautious during general movements as well as during driving. Also, more stringent tests should be taken for driving license renewal in higher age groups...|$|R
5|$|Daniel Pinkerton is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the Uncharted: Eye of Indra motion comic. Fred Tatasciore provides his voice. Pinkerton is an American who has become a crime boss in Indonesia. Pinkerton hires Drake, who is seeking the funds to raise the coffin of Francis Drake, to find the valuable Eye of Indra. After discovering that Pinkerton has unknowingly had the Eye in his safe the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> Drake attempts to retrieve it by raiding Pinkerton's home. Pinkerton captures Drake, and tortures him when he refuses to reveal the treasure's location. When Drake eventually reveals {{the location of the}} Eye of Indra, Rika Raja shoots and kills Pinkerton, and the two take the Eye of Indra for themselves.|$|E

With a bombing party of 10 men, who voluntarily undertook this duty, he conveyed {{a supply of}} 96 bombs to within 20 yards of the enemy's position over exceptionally dangerous ground, after the attempts of two other parties had failed. Lieutenant Smyth succeeded in taking the bombs to the desired position {{with the aid of}} two of his men (the other eight having been killed or wounded), and to effect his purpose he had to swim a stream, being exposed the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> to howitzer, shrapnel, machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The minimum <b>whole</b> {{production}} <b>time</b> is a {{very effective}} tool to improve production efficiency in the printing company. Printing scheduling {{is a key to}} achieve this goal. In this paper, we use Peter Rof-Hamm algorithm to determine better printing scheduling quickly with the minimum <b>whole</b> production <b>time.</b> Performance of the proposed method is compared with rule-based heuristic algorithm. This proposed algorithm is very simple, and it can get near-optimum printing scheduling quickly, which makes it more useful in the printing scheduling...|$|R

Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified.

5|$|Kojima {{designed}} boss {{battles of}} Snake Eater {{to be totally}} different from those in previous Metal Gear games, or any other games. He said that the boss battle with sniper The End best represented free, open gameplay in the game. The battle takes place over a large area of dense jungle, and the player must search extensively for The End, who attacks over long range from an unknown position. This battle of attrition can last for hours, and contrasts with other boss fights in which the enemy is {{right in front of}} the player and in view the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, the player has the ability to both avoid this boss battle altogether by killing The End earlier in the game; or save and quit during the fight, wait a week, and reload the game to find The End having died of old age. Kojima commented that features like this do not appear in other games.|$|E

The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make {{his way out of the}} base alone.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E

5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

25|$|To prevent false-triggering of the {{automatic}} flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected {{for at least}} five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> that a presence is detected.|$|E
