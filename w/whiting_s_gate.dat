Transiting the Suez Canal on 9 December, the guided missile cruiser returned to the Red Sea, in-chopping to CTG 150.5 the following day. Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Gates</b> then conducted maritime interdiction operations in the Strait of Tiran (10-14 December), completing her 37th boarding of the deployment on the latter date (14 December).

Kennedy, [...] and America, “ensuring that all friendly aircraft returned safely through the air defense net while preventing any possible raid-following Iraqi aircraft getting through.” Following a visit to Hurghada (14-18 February), Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Gates</b> operated once more in the Red Sea (19 February-1 March), during which time (24 February) the ground war began in Iraq and Kuwait. Following the cease-fire (28 February), the ship conducted a brief period of maritime interdiction operations in the Gulf of Aqaba. Following an in-port period at Jeddah (2-10 March), where she underwent an IMAV alongside the destroyer tender , Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Gates</b> transited the Suez Canal (12 March).

Transiting the Strait of Gibraltar on 18 May, the guided missile cruiser operated {{from one end of}} the Mediterranean to the other for almost two months, pausing at Augusta Bay (23-24 May), Naples (26-30 May), and Gaeta, Italy (4-7 June), participating in Exercise Dasix Lafayette 92-1 (9-11 June), and visiting Ibiza, Spain (13-19 June), a call enlivened by an emergency sortie from her anchorage (14 June) because of heavy seas. Following her participation in joint-service exercise Eclipse Bravo (21-28 June), Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Gates</b> then visited Villefranche-sur-Mer, France (30 June-10 July 1992, during which time she received an IMAV alongside destroyer tender Yellowstone. She then operated in the Gulf of Lyon (11-12 July), after which she paused at Monaco (13-17 July). The guided missile cruiser participated in ASW exercises in the Strait of Bonifacio (19-20 July), before she was diverted to the Adriatic to serve as anti-air warfare commander for Commander TF 61 in support of Operation Provide Promise (23 July-2 September), monitoring the safety of relief flights into beleaguered Sarajevo. During that time, she took part in missile-firing exercises in the Ionian Sea (27 August). At the conclusion of those operations, she employed her embarked SH-60B Seahawk helicopters in search and rescue efforts in the wake of the crash of an Italian relief aircraft in the former region of Yugoslavia (3 September). Following a visit to Trieste, Italy (4-13 September), Thomas <b>S.</b> <b>Gates</b> then operated in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas (14-24 September), before pausing briefly for a port visit to Aksaz Karagac, Turkey on 25 September 1992.|$|R
2500|$|The {{relationships}} of the Sillaginidae are poorly known, with very similar morphological characteristics {{and a lack}} of genetic studies restricting the ability to perform cladistic analyses on the family. Being the fossil sillaginids are based on the comparison of fossil otoliths, with no other type of remains found thus far, this also prevents the reconstruction of the evolution of the family through fossil species. While the position of the Sillaginidae in the order Perciformes is firmly established due to a number of synapomorphies shared {{with other members of the}} order, no sister group has been established for the family. The current taxonomic status of the family is thought to represent a basic picture of the group's phylogeny, with McKay further dividing the genus Sillago into three subgenera based on shared morphological characters of the swimbladder. The genera Sillaginodes and Sillaginopsis have the most plesiomorphic characteristics; being monotypic, and distinct from Sillago. Sillago is further divided into three subgenera based primarily on swim bladder morphology; Sillago, Parasillago and Sillaginopodys, which also [...] represent evolutionary relationships. Whilst genetic studies have not been done on the family, they have been used to establish the relationship of what were thought to be various subspecies of school <b>whiting,</b> <b>S.</b> bassensis and S. flindersi. Furthermore, morphological data suggests a number of Australian species diverged very recently during the last glacial maximum, which caused land bridges to isolate populations of fish. The two aforementioned species of school <b>whiting,</b> <b>S.</b> maculata and S. burrus, and S. ciliata and S. analis are all thought to be products of such a process, although only the school whiting have anything other than similar morphology as evidence of this process.|$|R
