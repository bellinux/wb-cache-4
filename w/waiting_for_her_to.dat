5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E

While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12. Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita (Joely Richardson) {{probably}} knows where she is. He and Salander monitor Anita, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> contact Harriet. When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, deducing that the woman posing as Anita is Harriet herself.

25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, {{he will continue to}} follow her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E

Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty's behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship.|$|E
500|$|Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{opens with}} a {{black-and-white}} video interlude of Rihanna putting on and zipping up leather clothing. Scenes are intercut with an aerial view of the audience in the arena. As the audience is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> perform, scenes of Rihanna approaching the stage are shown. As she says [...] "Let's go" [...] the music begins to play. The concert opens as Rihanna emerges from a portable floor behind a giant curtain and starts performing her debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". The show continues with her performing [...] "Break It Off" [...] and [...] "Let Me". Before performing [...] "Rehab", Rihanna reveals that the song was written by Justin Timberlake who is her [...] "very good friend and hopes that the audience like it". Then, she performs [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] before rendering a cover of [...] "Is This Love", a song by Jamaican reggae singer Bob Marley and his band The Wailers. [...] "Is This Love" [...] is mashed-up with [...] "Kisses Don't Lie".

500|$|As {{her time}} on the show was nearing its end, it was {{announced}} that DeGarmo was to debut a country ballad song entitled [...] "Good Goodbye". Kelly Ballhorn of Ryanseacrest.com noted that: [...] "Fans of 'Young and the Restless' and Diana have been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sing on the show like she can in real life... well, the wait’s over". [...] "Good Goodbye" [...] was co-written by DeGarmo and her real-life fiance Ace Young, who was also a competitor on American Idol, and details Angelina's [...] "emotional journey" [...] on the show. She was approached by the show's award-winning composer David Kurtz, and he asked her to make a song for Angelina. Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said: [...] "It’s supposed to be a turning point to her character. Her character on the most part has been pushy and full of herself." [...] During an interview with TV Guide, DeGarmo said that the song will [...] "tug at your heartstrings" [...] and marks a big turning point for Angelina's storyline: [...] "where she's finally starting to grow up. She's coming to realize that she needs to get rid of her selfish ways. She doesn't know how to go about that like a normal person, so she does it through song." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 1973, {{while waiting}} for his mother, 52-year-old Clarnell Elizabeth Strandberg, {{to come home from}} a party, Kemper fell asleep and was then awakened by her arrival. While his mother was sitting in bed reading a book, she noticed Kemper enter her room and said, [...] "I suppose you're going to want to sit up all night and talk now." [...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.

2500|$|... "The second {{key to this}} song's Enormous Chart Success," [...] Pallett continues, [...] "has to do {{with the}} {{weighting}} of the melody lines." [...] Perry begins singing each verse on the beat ("you think I'm pretty ...") but then falls off it {{before the end of the}} first line ("... makeup on"), syncopating the melody, creating additional tension. [...] "Her lines dovetail elegantly into each other. This contributes to the feeling of suspension that I mentioned above. As listeners, we're <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> get to the point." [...] Pallett says she does indeed do this in the pre-chorus, when she accentuates the imperatives ("Let's go all the way tonight ...") by returning to the beat. Pallett than calls it [...] "genius" [...] that the chorus itself inverts the weighting of the verses, as the line [...] "You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream" [...] goes from off beat to on and then back again, in a single line.|$|E
2500|$|Framton Nuttel, {{a nervous}} man, {{has come to}} stay in the country for his health. His sister, who thinks he should socialise while he is there, has given him letters of {{introduction}} to families in the neighbourhood whom she got to know when she was staying there a few years previously. Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day. When Mrs Sappleton comes down she talks about her husband and her brothers, and how they are going to come back from shooting soon, and Framton, believing that she is deranged, tries to [...] distract her by talking about his health. Then, to his horror, Mrs Sappleton points out that her husband and her brothers are coming, and he sees them walking towards the window with their dog. He thinks he is seeing ghosts and runs away. Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him. The last line summarizes the story, saying of the niece, [...] "Romance at short notice was her speciality." ...|$|E
