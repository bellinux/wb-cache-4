40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{examined}} genetic {{relationships among}} <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>olives,</b> {{which is a}} very important crop in the economy of the Aegean region. We used RAPD analysis to evaluate relationships among and within 22 olive subspecies from Manisa, Mugla and Izmir provinces in Turkey. Twelve of the subspecies were wild and 10 were cultivated olives. Fifty-two primers were used (OP-Q 1 - 20, OP-I 1 - 20, OP-F 14 - 15 - 16 - 17, and OP-K 1 - 8) and 49 polymorphic bands were selected and used for analysis. The dendrogram based on unweighted pair-group cluster analysis using the Sorensen-Dice coefficient of similarity index indicated two major groups, dividing <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> from cultivated olives. The patterns of genetic relationships among and within the different olives were analyzed by means of analysis of molecular variance.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, was reconstructed in a phylogenetic and coa- lescent framework using full mitochondrial genome data from 21 individuals covering the entire world- wide distribution of the species.

The early subdivision of the olive fly reflects the Quaternary differentiation between Olea europea subsp. europea in the Mediterranean area and the two lineages of Olea europea subsp. cuspidata in Africa and Asia, pointing to an early and close association between the olive fly and its host. The geo- graphic structure and timing of olive fly differentiation in the Mediterranean indicates a clear connection with the post-glacial recolonization of <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> in the area, and is irreconcilable with the early histor- ical process of domestication and spread of the cultivated olive from its Levantine origin. Therefore, we suggest an early co-history of the olive fly with its wild host during the Quaternary and post-glacial peri- ods and a multi-regional shift of olive flies to cultivated olives as these cultivars gradually replaced <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> in historical times...|$|R

40|$|Background and AimsGenetic {{characterization}} and phylogenetic {{analysis of}} the oldest trees could be a powerful tool both for germplasm collection and for understanding the earliest origins of clonally propagated fruit crops. The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is a suitable model to study the origin of cultivars due to its long lifespan, resulting {{in the existence of}} both centennial and millennial trees across the Mediterranean Basin. MethodsThe genetic identity and diversity as well as the phylogenetic relationships among the oldest <b>wild</b> and cultivated <b>olives</b> of southern Spain were evaluated by analysing simple sequence repeat markers. Samples from both the canopy and the roots of each tree were analysed to distinguish which trees were self-rooted and which were grafted. The ancient olives were also put into chronological order to infer the antiquity of traditional olive cultivars. Key ResultsOnly 9 · 6 % out of 104 a priori cultivated ancient genotypes matched current olive cultivars. The percentage of unidentified genotypes was higher among the oldest olives, which could be because they belong to ancient unknown cultivars or because of possible intra-cultivar variability. Comparing the observed patterns of genetic variation made it possible to distinguish which trees were grafted onto putative <b>wild</b> <b>olives.</b> ConclusionsThis study of ancient olives has been fruitful both for germplasm collection and for enlarging our knowledge about olive domestication. The findings suggest that grafting pre-existing <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> with olive cultivars was linked to the beginnings of olive growing. Additionally, the low number of genotypes identified in current cultivars points out that the ancient olives from southern Spain constitute a priceless reservoir of genetic diversity...|$|R

These ancestral wild gene pools have provided the essential foundations for cultivated olive breeding.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of organic and conventional commercial olive farming systems was conducted in a wide-area of Andalusia, southern Spain {{to determine the effect}} of management practices on chemical and biological soil properties. Soils from 41 accredited organic farms, 49 conventionally managed neighboring farms, and three sites containing wild or feral forms of olive were analyzed. A polyphasic approach was used combining traditional soil physicochemical analysis, culture-dependent microbiological analyses, sole-carbon-source utilization profiles using the Biolog EcoPlate assay and enzymatic activities using the API ZYM assay. Different multivariate statistical analyses clearly demonstrated that olive orchard soils could be differentiated by farm management system. Discriminant analysis differentiated among three well defined soil groups that correlated with the farm management system (conventional, organic or <b>wild</b> <b>olives).</b> Thus, enzymatic activities and sole-carbon-source utilization profiles correctly classified 75, 77 and 100 % of soil samples from orchards under organic and conventional management or <b>wild</b> <b>olives,</b> respectively. Overall, all diversity and functional indexes estimated from the Biolog EcoPlate and API ZYM assays were positively and significantly correlated with SOM, organic C and N content and the C:N ratio, and negatively and significantly correlated with clay content. In general olive orchards under organic management showed significantly higher SOM, organic C and N content, and C:N ratio, as well as higher microbial diversity as measured by catabolic capability and functional indexes of the Biolog EcoPlate and API ZYM assays as compared to conventionally managed orchards. Given the crucial importance of maintaining or increasing soil health in agricultural ecosystems, this is the first demonstration that commercial olive orchards under organic management in southern Spain are agricultural systems that may contribute to promote and conserve soil quality and health. © 2013 Elsevier B.

Even though he bears the epithet of Pater he is no head of a divine family; however some testimonies lend him a companion, sometimes female, and a son and/or a daughter. They belong {{to the family of}} the nymphs or genies of springs. Janus intervenes in the miracle of the hot spring during the battle between Romulus and Tatius: Juturna and the nymphs of the springs are clearly related to Janus as well as Venus, that in Ovid's Metamorphoses cooperates in the miracle and may have been confused with Venilia, or perhaps the two might have been originally one. Janus has a direct link only to Venilia, with whom he fathered Canens. The magic role of the <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> tree (oleaster) is prominent in the description of the duel between Aeneas and Turnus reflecting its religious significance and powers: it was sacred to sailors, also those who had shipwrecked as a protecting guide to the shore. It was probably venerated by a Prelatin culture in association with Faunus. In the story of Venulus coming back from Apulia too one may see the religious connotation of the wild olive: the king discovers one into which a local shepherd had been turned for failing to respect the nymphs he had come across in a nearby cavern, apparently Venilia, who was the deity associated with the magic virtues of such tree. Gagé finds it remarkable that the characters related to Janus are in the Aeneis {{on the side of the}} Rutuli. In the poem Janus would be represented by Tiberinus. Olistene, the daughter of Janus with Camese, may reflect in her name that of the olive or oleaster, or of Oreithyia. Camese may be reflected in Carmenta: Evander's mother is from Arcadia, comes to Latium as an exile migrant and has her two festivals in January: Camese's name at any rate does not look Latin.|$|E

The coefficient of similarity of Kulczynsky (K 1), which calculates the ratio between common markers relative to the number of unique markers (range 0 to ∞), was used for such purpose. Low K 1 values (lower than 3. 61) were obtained {{for the majority of the}} pair of cultivars (99. 80 % of the total). Low and similar ranges of K 1 values were also found in both a seedling progeny of 'Picual'. ×. 'Arbequina' and a set of <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> included in the study. These results may suggest that most of the WOGB-Córdoba cultivars studied probably were derived from outcrossing events. As expected, low similarity values were found among different cultivars with the same naming (homonyms). On the contrary, a total of 105 pairs (0. 20 %) showed K 1 values above 14. 58, implying thus low genetic differentiation. These high K 1 values suggest the presence of potential redundant germplasm in the collection which likely includes synonyms, accumulation of somatic mutations, redundancies from prospecting surveys, and planting errors. Thus, the genetic relationships revealed by DArT markers among cultivars are of great interest for management of olive collections and could be useful to increase the performance of future breeding programs by optimizing the choice of parents in combination with phenotypic information. Finally, the transferability of DArT markers to <b>wild</b> <b>olives</b> has been confirmed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
