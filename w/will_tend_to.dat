5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{become more common}} in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators.

An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1.

5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency <b>will</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
