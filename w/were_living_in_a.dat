5|$|At {{the time}} of Bojić's birth, his parents <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small flat at No. 4 Sremska Street, {{situated}} just above his father's shop in Belgrade's Stari Grad. Over the next decade, they had four more children– Jelica (b. 1894), Danica (b. 1896), Radivoje (b. 1900) and Dragoljub (b. 1905). All of their children survived to adulthood. When Bojić was a child, {{he and his family}} were frequently visited by his mother's cousin Jovan Sremac, the brother of humourist Stevan Sremac. Jovan is said to have greatly influenced the young Bojić, having introduced him to Serbian folk tales and medieval legends at an early age.|$|E
5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles.

They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E

Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E

25|$|In New York, a town is a {{municipal}} corporation, {{which is the}} major division of each county (excluding the five counties that comprise New York City), very similar to townships in other states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Towns in New York are classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as minor civil divisions. As in most Northeastern states, every square foot of New York is incorporated; all residents who {{do not live in}} a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town. Towns provide or arrange for the primary functions of local government. While some provide most municipal services for all town residents and selected services for residents of villages, some provide little more than road maintenance. There are 932 towns in New York. As of 2000, 45.8% of state residents <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> town; 35.9% <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> town but outside of a village. Whereas cities and villages can cross county boundaries, all towns in New York are within a single county.|$|E

25|$|An additional, rabbinic prohibition, which Jewish {{religious}} tradition ascribes {{to the court}} of King Solomon, forbids carrying in any area that was shared by the occupants of more than one dwelling, even if it is surrounded by fences or walls. But, in this case of areas surrounded by walls, carrying was allowed through the use of an eruv. The eruv consists of a food item – in general bread – that is shared by all dwellers. By means of this shared meal, all the dwellers are considered as if they <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common dwelling, thus exempting them from the added prohibition.|$|E
25|$|Water, {{along with}} grassy vegetation, is another major {{component}} of the Przewalski horse's diet. A study, conducted by K.M. Scheibe {{and a team of}} scientists, documented the water consumption of 12 female Przewalski horses that <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semireserve over a course of 17 months. Their results show that, on average, a Przewalski horse drinks between 2.4 and 8.3 liters of water a day, which is less than the amount of water a domestic horse drinks daily. In fact, the Przewalski horse that consumed the most water in the study drank on average 8.6 liters of water a day. This almost equals the lowest amount of water consumption for a domestic horse which is 8.4 liters a day.|$|E

Rogers burned the town and claimed to have killed 200; the actual number was 30 killed (women and children, since the men were not in the village) and 5 captured. Following the 3 October 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers' force ran out of food during their retreat back through the rugged wilderness of northern Vermont. The Rangers reached a safe location along the Connecticut River at the abandoned Fort Wentworth. Rogers left them encamped, and returned a few days later with food and relief forces from Fort at Number 4, now Charlestown, New Hampshire, the nearest British town.|$|E
25|$|There are sixty-two {{cities in}} the state.

In 1686, the English colonial governor granted the cities of New York and Albany city charters, which were recognized by the first State Constitution in 1777. All other cities have been established by act of the state legislature and have been granted a charter. Cities have been granted the power to revise their charters or adopt new ones. There are no minimum population or area requirements in order to become a city. While there is no defined process for how and when a village becomes a city, the Legislature requires clear evidence, usually {{in the form of a}} locally drafted charter, that the community in question seeks to incorporate as a city.|$|E
