25|$|Josiah Dann, a tramcar conductor, {{was summoned}} on 2 August 1883 for having carried 28 {{passengers}} {{when the car}} was only licensed for 24. The officer noticed the tramcar in Carrington Street drawn by one horse and counted the passengers. When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop {{and some of the}} passengers got out. The conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Air Force {{had started a}} {{research}} project into future interceptor aircraft that eventually settled on an advanced specification known as the 1954 interceptor. Contracts for this specification eventually resulted {{in the selection of}} the F-102 Delta Dagger, but by 1952 it was becoming clear that none of the parts of the specification other than the airframe would be ready by 1954; the engines, weapons and fire control systems <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to take too long to get into service. An effort was then started to quickly produce an interim supersonic design to replace the various subsonic interceptors then in service, and the F-101 airframe was selected as a starting point.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enemies of Reality {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{during a time}} of personal and professional tumult for the members of Nevermore. [...] Warrel Dane attributes the sound of the album to the challenges that the band members faced during this period: [...] "Enemies Of Reality was a difficult album to make. We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> through a difficult time in our lives. We were all really fucking angry people, and I think that kind of shows on that album." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] said Seaforth, as Okanagan {{signed to}} him. [...] "You see, we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> there {{together}} by the shortest way, down the canon." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lady Bertram, [...] "but I wish {{he was not}} <b>going</b> away. They <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> away, I think. I {{wish they}} would stay at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems a most {{questionable}} step," [...] said Summerlee, argumentative to the last, [...] "but if you <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going,</b> I {{hardly see}} how I can remain behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{have had}} such a {{pleasant}} time,' he said ruefully, 'and if this fellow {{is going to stay}} here I can see it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> spoilt.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> down to Grandpa's for Christmas," [...] {{said the}} little mother's oldest boy dolefully. [...] "We've {{never been there}} before, and it's just too bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' he said. 'I {{felt ashamed}} when I {{was there and}} they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> about in a lugubrious false way, feeling they must not be natural or ordinary.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she declared, [...] "it is chilly {{out here}} to-night. We <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> {{back into the}} drawing-room. I am {{going to make you}} listen while I sing." ...|$|R

60|$|One {{morning when}} they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> out in Mrs. Lander's gondola, she sent Clementina back {{three times to}} their rooms for outer {{garments}} of differing density. When she brought the last Mrs. Lander frowned.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will; but we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to give something. I headed {{the paper with}} my five dollars; for if it <b>is</b> done at <b>all,</b> it must <b>be</b> done handsome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The ghost," [...] was the {{unexpected}} reply. [...] "It came into our camp {{last night and}} we don't {{want to see it}} again. We <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> back to Lake Cameron." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> to work; {{she also}} was going to work. Her ticket was the same. She sat trying {{to fit in with}} them. But fear was at her bowels, she felt an unknown, terrible grip upon her.|$|E
