We lived before, and shall live again; and as we hope for a fairer world than this to come; so <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> one less fine. From each {{successive}} world, the demon Principle is more and more dislodged; he is the accursed clog from chaos, and thither, by every new translation, we drive him further and further back again. Hosannahs to this world! so beautiful itself, and the vestibule to more. Out of some past Egypt, we have come to this new Canaan, and from this new Canaan, we press on to some Circassia.|$|E
500|$|Although the survivors' {{experiences}} after Rosewood were disparate, none publicly acknowledged {{what had}} happened. Robie Mortin, Sam Carter's niece, {{was seven years}} old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland, [...] east of Rosewood, on January 3, 1923. Mortin's father avoided the heart of Rosewood {{on the way to the}} depot that day, a decision Mortin believes saved their lives. Mortin's father met them years later in Riviera Beach, in South Florida. None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood, on order from Mortin's grandmother: [...] "She felt like maybe if somebody knew where <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> they might come at us".|$|E
500|$|Bleeding Through was an American {{heavy metal}} band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended {{influences}} stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. [...] Although {{the band was}} often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati {{was asked if he}} considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: [...] "I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1651, Arnold left Providence and Pawtuxet for Aquidneck Island (which {{was officially}} called Rhode Island at the time), {{settling}} in Newport. [...] He {{recorded in the}} family record, [...] "Memorandum. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Providence with our family to Dwell at Newport in Rhode Island the 19th of November, Thursday in afternoon, & arrived ye same night [...] Ano. Domina 1651". [...] With only a few exceptions, men from Newport held the reins of power for the first century of Rhode Island history. [...] When the first English settlers came to Aquidneck Island in 1638, they organized a quarterly court and English-style jury trial. [...] In 1640, Newport established monthly courts, rights of appeal, and trial by jury, whereas in Providence there was no court, no judge, and no jury.|$|E
500|$|Genesis were {{targets for}} {{criticism}} throughout the 1970s {{from those who}} disliked progressive rock. Influential BBC DJ John Peel championed the band in their early years and they performed three sessions for him between 1970 and 1972, but he [...] "grew disillusioned with their later excesses". Some regarded the group as overtly middle class, paying {{particular attention to the}} founder members' private education, and claimed rock music was being taken away from the working class, whom they regarded as its core audience. Likening his background to that of the punk artist Joe Strummer, who had become a [...] "people's hero" [...] musician, Gabriel stated in 2013, [...] "To this day, we've never outgrown the snotty rich-kid thing ... we were always very straight about where <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> and we were middle-class, not aristocratic". Gabriel's theatrics were unpalatable to some of the mainstream rock audience, resulting in a cult following rather than that of a mainstream rock band.|$|E
500|$|Roger Wilkins, {{a history}} {{professor}} at George Mason University who studies race in the United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] provided [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of where <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E

500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's sound {{has been}} {{described}} as emo pop, pop, pop rock, and power pop. Gaskarth felt the album was [...] "more of a pop-rock/alt-rock album for us. There are definitely elements of pop punk—where <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> But this album was an effort to develop our sound and hone in [...] on great songwriting rather than conform to the boundaries of a certain genre." [...] Gaskarth mentioned that they [...] "took influence from our older stuff in some of the songs, but in others we went in a new direction, whether that was poppier or more rock or just weird." [...] Gaskarth added that [...] "We stripped a lot of the bells and whistles out this time and I think the songs are better off for it." [...] Barakat said the album was [...] "a good mix of faster type typical ATL songs and also some slow ballad type songs." [...] He added [...] "there are a lot of pop songs, as well as a lot rock songs. There isn’t a mix of the two. I think they are a lot more distinguished this time around." ...|$|E
