5|$|The Deep End is an American legal drama {{created by}} David Hemingson that ran on ABC from January 21 until February 25, 2010 and {{produced}} by 20th Century Fox Television.

5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> {{associated}} with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly {{with the introduction of}} Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E

Despite these early light roles, Parker's onscreen charisma and general je ne sais quoi showed, earning Parker comparisons to Paul Newman. In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner turmoil. In 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character.

25|$|Shevardnadze's {{appointment}} as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by Jumber Patiashvili, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of perestroika. Towards {{the end of}} the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia's minority-populated regions (notably South Ossetia). On April 9, 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded and poisoned. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many—even some Georgian communists—to conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule.|$|E

25|$|He was {{appointed}} Commander of British Land Forces in the Persian Gulf on 30 April 1969 in which role he re-organised the Trucial Oman Scouts {{and laid the}} foundations for {{what is now the}} Sultan of Oman's Land Forces. Appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours 1972, he became Commander of 1st (British) Corps with the rank of lieutenant general on 14 January 1972 and Commander-in-Chief, UK Land Forces with the rank of full general on 1 April 1974. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours 1976 and having become ADC General to the Queen on 25 June 1976, he became Chief of the General Staff on 15 July 1976.

25|$|By all accounts, when Juan Diego, age 57, {{reported}} the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico in 1531, {{he did not}} receive {{a lot of attention}} in Rome, since the Church was busy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of the Protestant Reformation of 1521 to 1579 and perhaps very few Cardinals in Rome had ever heard the details of Mexico and its environs. Yet, just as {{a large number of people}} were leaving the Catholic Church in Europe as a result of the Reformation, Our Lady of Guadalupe was instrumental in adding almost 8 million people to the ranks of Catholics in the Americas between 1532 and 1538. The number of Catholics in South America has grown significantly over the centuries. Eventually with tens of millions of followers, Juan Diego had an effect on Mariology in the Americas and beyond, and was eventually declared venerable in 1987. Juan Diego was declared a saint in 2002. Furthermore, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico is now the third largest Catholic Church in the world, after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil. Recent reported apparitions such as Medjugorje have also attracted a large following.|$|E

500|$|These {{aspects of}} the symphonic poem demanded players to have {{superior}} caliber, perfect intonation, keen ears {{and knowledge of the}} roles of their orchestra members. The complexity of the symphonic poems may have been one reason that Liszt urged other conductors to [...] "hold aloof" [...] from the works until they were prepared to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges.</b> Most orchestras of small towns at that time were not capable of meeting the demands of this music. Contemporary orchestras also faced another challenge when playing Liszt's symphonic poems for the first time. Liszt kept his works on manuscripts, distributing them to the orchestra on his tour. Some parts of the manuscripts were so heavily corrected that players found it difficult to decipher them, let alone play them well. The symphonic poems were considered such a financial risk that orchestral parts for many of them were not published until the 1880s.|$|E

[...] Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers.

The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight to life when dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of intimacy and isolation.
