P. Bandyopadhyay, University of North Dakota, and Dr. R. Ohmori, of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RINEN), Tokyo, Japan, from June through August, 1994. Dr. Ohmori pioneered the novel ELID grinding technology which incorporates electrolytically enhanced, in-process dressing of metal bonded superabrasive wheels. The principle of ELID grinding technology is discussed in the report as will its application for rough grinding and precision grinding. Two types of silicon nitride based ceramics (Kyocerals Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }, and Eaton`s SRBSN) were ground under various conditions with ELID methods. Mirror surface finishes were obtained with {number_sign} 4000 mesh size wheel (average grain size = 4 {mu}m). Results of these investigations are presented in this report. These include the effects of <b>wheel</b> <b>bond</b> type, type of power supply, abrasive grit friability, and cooling fluid composition. The effects of various parameters are {{discussed in terms of}} the mechanisms of ELID grinding, and in particular, the manner of boundary layer formation on the wheels and abrasive grit protrusion...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{experimentally}} investigating the effect of microgrinding on the integrity of thermally sprayed nanostructured WC/ 12 Co and Al 2 O 3 / 13 TiO 2 coatings and theoretically developing a mechanical model to simulate the machining process of ceramics. A comprehensive microgrinding experiment is designed to {{study the effects of}} the grinding process parameters, such as abrasive grit size, <b>wheel</b> <b>bond</b> type, wheel depth of cut, and workpiece feedrate, on surface finish, subsurface damage, and residual stresses of these coatings. The correlation between the grinding conditions and the integrity of ground samples helps provide an experimental basis for developing a viable microgrinding technique for nanostructured materials and coated samples. A simple X-ray diffraction technique, glancing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD), is introduced to measure the depth profiles of residual stresses in the coatings. The results of the experiment show that the effects of the microgrinding process are limited to the surface layer of ground coatings; the wheel depth of cut is the most influential parameter in the cup-type grinding; ductile flow is the dominant material removal mechanism in grinding n-WC/ 12 Co coatings under all conditions and in grinding n-A 1 2 O 3 / 13 TiO 2 at a low material removal rate, the residual stresses induced by the microgrinding process are compressive, strongly depend on the grinding direction, and show a strong gradient in the thickness direction for both coatings. ^ Based on continuum damage mechanics, a theoretical model is developed for predicting the behavior of ceramics under complex loadings. Unlike the linear elastic fracture mechanics, this damage model includes the effects of cracks, microcracks and inelastic deformation. The model is employed to simulate the damage development in ceramic samples during the machining process using a fourth order isotropic damage tensor. The simulated machining process is similar to the interaction between the abrasive grit and a ceramic sample in surface grinding. The final state of damage and residual stresses in the machined ceramic samples is calculated with this model. The simulation results agree well with the experimental results. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} {{primarily}} {{on the effect of}} bond and workpiece composition on the performance of vitreous-bonded alumina grinding wheels. The effect of bond composition considered in this work can equally be applied to grinding wheels which use silicon carbide (carborundum) as the abrasive medium. The bonds considered in this study are described as sintering bonds (high clay content), used in silicon carbide grinding wheels, - and fusible bonds (high glass content), used in vitreous bonding systems suitable for use in aluminium oxide grinding wheels. The initial part of the research work deals with a review of the mechanisms of grinding and the evaluation of wheel performance. The effect of grinding conditions, abrasive compositions, and workpiece material composition on the mechanisms of grinding wheel wear in conventional wheels was studied. The analysis of grinding wheel wear was examined and compared with experimental data. Reactions in grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>bond</b> materials were examined by comparing theoretical equilibrium compositions with actual reaction products using experimental techniques such as x-ray powder methods and differential thermal analysis. Experimental studies were carried out to investigate the vitrification behaviour of sintering and fusible bonds. This was achieved by examining the relationship between theoretical equilibrium liquid and silica contents and experimental vitrification conditions. A semi-empirical model was developed for determining optimum firing conditions for sintering and fusible bonds. The effect of bond composition on the strength of sintering and fusible bonds, under fixed firing conditions, was investigated. This resulted in some bonds failing by cracks around quartz particles, whilst bonds with high glass contents failed by a combination of pore-flaws. A model was also developed which predicted the amount of quartz remaining after heat treatment. The model was shown to be accurate when compared with experimental data. Based on the results of the experimental work on bond characterisation, the effect of bond and workpiece composition was compared with grinding wheel performance data. This was achieved by grinding a variety of hardened tool steels with abrasive segments manufactured with optimised grades. An empirical model was developed which showed that wheel wear was a function of bond strength and the nature of complex carbides present in the microstructure of the tool steels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} bonding hard {{materials}} such as aluminium oxide and cubic boron nitride (cBN) {{and the nature of}} interfacial cohesion between these materials and glass is very important from the perspective of high precision grinding. Vitrified grinding wheels are typically used to remove large volumes of metal and to produce components with very high tolerances. It is expected that the same grinding wheel is used for both rough and finish machining operations. Therefore, the grinding wheel, and in particular its bonding system, is expected to react differently to a variety of machining operations. In order to maintain the integrity of the grinding <b>wheel,</b> the <b>bonding</b> system that is used to hold abrasive grains in place reacts differently to forces that are placed on individual bonding bridges.

50|$|Some common {{attributing}} {{factors to}} wheel {{can be caused}} by grain fracture, which can be advantages, is the results of a portion of each of the individual grains on the wheel surface breaking apart and leaving the remaining grain <b>bonded</b> to the <b>wheel.</b> The fractured grain is left with newly exposed sharp edges which attribute the self-sharpening characteristic of grinding wheels and cutting tools in general. Attritious wear or progressive wear which is typically undesirable leads to the grains dulling by developing flat spots and rounded edges on the wheel which can deteriorate the wheels ability to remove material. Flat spots also can lead to excessive heat generation with the added surface contact which and in turn enable Bond fractures or the brittle fracture of the adhesive bonds between the grains. The removal of these worn grains from the adhesive <b>bonds</b> restores the <b>wheels</b> cutting ability once more. Grinding wheels can also be characterized by the grains increased capacity to fracture according to a level of higher value of friability. Different bonding materials are used depending on the intended use of the grinding <b>wheel.</b> The <b>bonding</b> material is classified by its individual strength called its wheel grade.|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

Consequently, when analyzing the elastic deformation of grinding wheels, the theory of Hertzian contact should not be applied in a simple way. In this study, a mathematical model of grinding wheels consisting of rigid bodies and spring elements had been proposed. By utilizing this model, elastic deformations of the grinding <b>wheels</b> with resinoid <b>bonds</b> in the contact area with workpieces are considered.

40|$|Brittle-hardmaterials like {{ceramics}} and cermets {{are used in}} many challenging applicationsbecause they are characterized by very interesting properties, such as asuperior specific stiffness, a high wear resistance, chemical stability [...] . Their major drawback however lies in their poor machinability. Enabling anaffordable production of smooth and accurate free-form shapes, will create amultitude of new applications. As an example, the fabrication of free-formcermet molds {{can lead to the}} mass fabrication of free-form lenses of opticalquality through replication. This application requires the workpiece to behighly accurate and to have a superb surface quality. ELID-grinding is one ofthe most promising techniques to realize this. Severalpublications have reported on the potential of ELID-grinding. However, onlylittle research has been conducted on the characteristics of the electrolyticdressing principle, which is still not fully understood at this moment. In thepresented research the electrochemical fundamentals of the passivation processhave been studied profoundly and a model has been developed which explains theelectrical behavior of the growth of the passivation layer. This model can beused to monitor and control the state of the passivation layer, in order tomaintain stable grinding conditions. Experiments have been carried out toinvestigate the influences of some of the key parameters on the passivationspeed of a grinding wheel. Additionally,several series of grinding experiments have been performed to analyze theELID-grinding process efficiency, the workpiece precision and the surfacequality of the part. This has been realized for three types of materials: ahardened steel, a cermet and a ceramic. Industrialapplication oriented experiments have been conducted for the grinding of a hardenedsteel. This material is for instance used in bearings and gears which aresubjected to intensive loads. ELID-grinding with metal <b>bonded</b> <b>wheels</b> shows someclear advantages such as high grinding ratios and a good final surface quality. Nonetheless, the traditional way of grinding hardened steels, i. e. by usingvitrified <b>bonded</b> <b>wheels,</b> is more time-efficient because these wheels benefitfrom better truing and dressing properties. In this workELID-grinding has been concluded to be more of interest for machining evenharder materials, such as technical {{ceramics and}} cermets. In the first (rough) machining phase, also called Â‘ELID-roughingÂ’, the goal is to remove material inan efficient way. ELID-grinding {{has been shown to be}} advantageous compared toconventional grinding methods with resin bonded and metal <b>bonded</b> <b>wheels.</b> Inthis process stage the ELID-dressing is beneficial because it leads to stableand efficient grinding conditions. Traditionally,the finishing steps have to be carried out on dedicated lapping and polishingmachines. This however requires the workpieces to be dismounted andre-installed, leading to a loss in precision and increased processing times. The ELID-dressing principle on the contrary can also be applied to grindingwheels containing very small abrasives. The Â‘ELID-finishingÂ’ stage cantherefore be carried out on the same grinding machine as the one used for therough machining stage. This will enhance the precision of the final workpiece. Moreover, the workpiece surface will show a mirror reflection due to the Raroughness which is in the order of magnitude of 1 nanometer.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to develop an adhesive bonding solution in order to remove the classic welding technology exploited nowadays in the automotive steel wheel system. The examined solution is an hybrid joint, based on adhesive boding combined {{with the presence of}} an interference fit. This hybrid joining technology consists in coupling two cylindrical components together by force-fitting one into the other after having placed an adhesive on the mating surfaces. This technique would allow the joining of dissimilar material to enable the design of hybrid lightweight wheels. Moreover, it would provide a better stress distribution in the joint area that could induce fatigue life improvement. The contributions of the adhesive and the interference on the performance of the final hybrid joint is still not completely clear. In particular, the effect of the adhesive nature and of its mechanical and adhesive responses on the performance of the hybrid joint is under concern in this research. A study of the phenomena acting at the interference level is conducted at the laboratory level before industrial case application. An experimental method is set up in order to test the adhesives in a press fit joint. Static and dynamic tests are carried out examining the behavior of different adhesives, including rigid epoxies and flexible polyurethanes, and fractographic analysis are then performed. The second part of the study is focused on the feasibility of the hybrid technology on the wheel system. Exploiting the outcomes of the laboratory analysis, <b>bonded</b> <b>wheel</b> prototypes are assembled and tested statically and dynamically, according to component validation in MW. From the laboratory scale analyses it is found that the adhesive type mainly affects the static resistance of the hybrid joint.

The tangential force and normal force are used to represent the friction coefficient {{in order to obtain}} the accurate real-time friction coefficient of oxide film. Therefore, the friction coefficient of various grinding <b>wheels</b> with different <b>bonding</b> agents, various grinding parameters, various grinding materials (nano- Al 2 O 3 ceramic, nano ZrO 2 ceramic and ordinary ZrO 2 ceramic), and ELID grinding and ordinary grinding can be further studied. The results show that: the friction coefficient of the oxide film on the bronze-based grinding wheel is greater than that composed by iron; the friction coefficient of the oxide film decreases with the increase in grinding depth and feeding speed; the friction coefficient of the oxide film and nano-materials is smaller than that of the oxide film and ordinary materials; the transformation from Î³-Fe 2 O 3 to Î±-Fe 2 O 3 in oxide film and the elastic deformation of the oxide film caused by the high-temperature of grinding may make the friction coefficient of ELID grinding greater than that of ordinary grinding, so the oxide film contains better property of friction and polishing.

In this study, two novel technologies were developed; selective extraction of pore inducers from vitrified bonded abrasives and thin film deposition of lubricants into vitrified bonded abrasives from supercritical solutions. ^ Highly porous vitrified grinding wheels were produced by selective extraction of pore inducers with dense CO 2. This technology was developed {{as an alternative to the}} conventional thermal technique. Green grinding wheels were made with CO 2 soluble pore inducers which were subsequently subjected to scCO 2. The extraction rate was a function of temperature, flow rate, and flow direction. The vanishing kinematic viscosity of scCO 2, combined with the relatively large solubility of the pore inducers, led to strong natural convention currents. The system was modeled using a coupled set of equations for external mass transfer and internal diffusion, with an average absolute error of 3. 4 %. Grinding tests demonstrated the scCO 2 extracted wheels performed as well if not better then conventional pore induced wheels. ^ Supercritical CO 2 was used for the deposition of fine films within vitrified <b>bonded</b> grinding <b>wheels.</b> Vitrified <b>bonded</b> abrasives were placed in a solution of lubricant dissolved in scCO 2. Upon depressurization, the solution passed through the cloud point and the lubricant precipitated out of solution and was deposited within the pore matrix of the grinding wheel.

The impregnated grinding wheels were subjected to grinding tests and had superior performance compared to grinding wheel standards. ^ In order to investigate the phenomena governing the deposition within the wheel, a glass pore was developed to model the system. The effect of supersaturation {{was investigated}} by altering the rate of approach to the cloud point. Rapid expansion led to high supersaturations and micron to submicron particles deposited uniformly throughout the pore. Deposition by temperature quench led to both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation.

A major finding is, that the use of ultra fine grinding wheels does not result in a superior surface quality compared to the use of a D 46 grinding <b>wheel</b> with resinoid <b>bond...</b>|$|R
40|$|Light weight {{orthotropic}} {{steel bridge}} decks {{have been widely}} utilized for bridges in seismic zones, movable bridges and long span bridges. In the last three decades, severe problems were reported in relation to asphaltic surfacing materials on orthotropic steel deck bridges. Earlier investigations {{have shown that the}} bonding strength of membrane layers to the surrounding materials has a strong influence on the structural response of orthotropic steel bridge decks. The most important requirement for the application of membrane materials on orthotropic steel bridge decks is that the membrane adhesive layer shall be able to provide sufficient bond to the surrounding materials. The research aims on developing a FE tool to simulate and understand the performance of asphaltic surfacing structures, so as to improve the design of surfacings and increase their service life. In this paper, Finite Element (FE) simulations of Merwedebrug bridge with two membrane layers system are presented. The finite element system CAPA- 3 D developed at the Section of Structural Mechanics of TU Delft has been utilized as the numerical platform for this study. Due to the multilayer of the surfacing materials and geometrical complexity of the steel bridge, the FE model shows the in time development of strains and stresses inside the surfacing materials depends highly on the wheel loading frequency, <b>wheel</b> position, membrane <b>bonding</b> strength as well as thicknesses and characteristics of the surfacing layers. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of strains and the evolution of damage in surfacing layers of different cases. Recommendations of surfacing structures design on orthotropic steel bridges are given. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The most {{effective}} method for finish machining of hard-metals and alloys {{is to use}} the diamond grinding wheels for grinding. An application of diamond wheels significantly increases the employee output, reduces costs, and raises manufacturing efficiency with achieving the high performance properties of treated surfaces. During grinding a working surface of diamond wheel wears out. It adversely affects the cutting capability of the diamond grains, and depending on the grinding conditions can occur through different mechanisms. Wear of diamond wheel causes distortion of its shape and reduces cutting properties. However, dressing of diamond wheels is a complicated and time-consuming operation in terms of manufacturing technique. Methods to make dressing of diamond grinding wheel have different types of classification. Classification of dressing methods by the type of energy used is as follows: mechanical, chemical, electrophysical, electromechanical, and electrochemical. All these methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Electrochemical method of dressing is the most productive and efficient. Electrochemical method comprises anode-mechanical dressing and electrochemical (electrolytic) one. The paper presents the electrochemical in-process dressing (ECD) and the electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID). The source of energy, grinding a <b>wheel</b> with metal <b>bond,</b> and an electrode are necessary for providing ELID. The ELID consists of several stages. The first stage is preliminary electrolytic dressing of diamond wheel. The electrolyte is placed into the gap between the wheel and electrode. The bond of theÂ wheel is oxidized. An insulating layer is formed. It reduces an electrical conductivity of the wheel and controls consumption of diamond grains, as well as polishes the surface of the work piece. Further, the insulating layer is destroyed. The cycle of dressing begins anew. The ECD proceeds {{in the same way as}} ELID. However during the ECD-process there is no insulating layer formed. The oxides are washed out by electrolyte flow. The method provides a constant escape of abrasive grain. The grain escape reaches 100 - 120 % of average diameter. Adaptation of ECD on conventional grinding machine is performed. For this, the copper electrode is mounted to the grinding wheel. The electrolyte circulates in the gap between the wheel and electrode. The control system for the normal and tangential forces of process is also used during the adaptation. The enterprise VNIIINSTRUMENT has designed a special experimental stand for diamond grinding. At this stand the ECD-dressing of diamond <b>wheel</b> with metal <b>bond</b> is implemented. This machine consists of a longitudinal support and a cross slide. Spindle of grinding wheel is set on the longitudinal support. A rotating speed of this spindle is about 50 - 3000 rev/min. A spindle of work piece is set on the cross slide. A rotating speed of this spindle is about 10 - 1000 rev/min. The copper electrode is mounted on the spindle of grinding wheel. An area of electrode surface is 1 / 3 of the wheel area. The gap between the grinding wheel and electrode is about 0. 3 mm. The electrolyte is placed in the gap. The electrode is anode and the grinding wheel is cathode. Wheel and electrode are connected to the direct current source. When switching on the power source, the process of electrolysis begins. A <b>bond</b> of the <b>wheel</b> is oxidized and washed out. Waste of dressing is carried away with electrolyte. The electrolyte leaves the zone of cutting. Next, the liquid gets into a special trough. Thereafter, the electrolyte enters the filter unit to have three steps of purification. The purified liquid is supplied to the pump, and then again enters the cutting zone. ECD provides a large escape abrasive grain out of bond. It ensures that the cutting force is constant. The constant cutting force ensures the surface finish consistency, decreased surface roughness, and improved accuracy of work piece form. Due to ECD, space for chips is formed between diamond grains. This allows the grinding wheel to avoid loading. The stand solves the problem of electrolyte purification. This helps to avoid burn marks and defects during grinding. A maximum efficiency of process may be achieved by adjusting the modes of wheel dressing. The ECD allows the use of nontraditional methods of grinding, including ductile mode grinding. However, for this it is necessary to apply the special kinematic scheme of grinding. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceService life of {{machined}} {{brittle material}} and particularly glass workpieces, used in technology {{fields such as}} civil engineering, transports or optics, could be shortened by local irregularities. Indeed, grooves or sub-surface damage (SSD) can lead to cracks and fracture in operation [1, 2]. Therefore, manufacturers tend to smoothen the surface finish by achieving a long and costly polishing phase. In a materal removal context, reducing damage during rough machining could also be considered since it could limit the polishing operation and eventually limit SSD. This study focuses on this proposal. Since roughness depends on the manufacturing process, material removal process must be carefully defined to obtain a surface finish that could match a service life criterion. Grinding process involves numerous parameters that can be classified in three categories : tool parameters (<b>wheel</b> shape, dimensions, <b>bond</b> material, abrasive nature and size [...] .), machining parameters (depth of cut feed rate, wheel speed, grinding direction [...] .) and contact parameters (temperature, lubricant type and flow, [...] .). As for roughness, main normalized parameters used remains Ra, the average roughness [3, 4] and Rq, the {{root mean square roughness}} [5]. However, these parameters provide information on the global surface finish only and especially not on local damage which could lead to crack propagation and fracture [6]. As this study aims at optimizing the rough grinding process on a local damage point of view, the roughness parameters that would characterize the most pertinently the rough ground surface of a brittle material workpiece need to be defined. Using appropriate roughness parameters, the grinding process can be improved by the understanding and optimization {{of the relationship between the}} surface finish and machining parameters. For this purpose, depth of cut, feed rate, wheel speed and grinding direction influence on the surface finish of ground window glass samples will be investigated through a central composite design of experiments. Based on the response surface methodology (RSM) [7], it allows to evaluate every parameter influence simultaneously. Even if some of these parameters influence has already been studied [8, 9], it has always been partially (one parameter alone) and mainly in a polishing context...|$|R
