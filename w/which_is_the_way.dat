It is distinguished from linguistic performance, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a language system is used in communication.

25|$|If {{one looks}} at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E

He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly biomimetic nanotechnology <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.|$|E

I began with a class ring that I {{remember}} reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the media, {{the ideal}} {{version of a}} man {{is seen as a}} strong, toned man. The {{idealized}} version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes. The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism. Self-objectification, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women. [...] Men typically experience it through media display. [...] The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.|$|E

In 2006, Goldenthal {{completed}} his original three-act opera with Taymor entitled Grendel an adaptation of the John Gardner novel of the same name which told the story of Beowulf from the monster Grendel's point of view. It had its world premiere in early June 2006 at the Los Angeles Opera, the role of Grendel performed by Eric Owens, with an audience that included John Williams and Emmy Rossum; the opus was added to the Los Angeles Opera's permanent repertoire and earned Goldenthal a nomination in April 2007 for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2008 Goldenthal reunited with Michael Mann to score 1930s gangster movie Public Enemies and in 2009 he scored another Julie Taymor Shakespeare adaptation, The Tempest. He cites Japanese composer Tōru Takemitsu as an influence and someone he styles his own career on; Goldenthal has said that the lines between traditional concert music and orchestral film score have become more blurred <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he thinks it should be. He has also collaborated four times with Irish director Neil Jordan, scoring movies like Interview with the Vampire and In Dreams.|$|E
