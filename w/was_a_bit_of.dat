5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art {{used for this}} album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 {{the idea}} of {{different}} races playing {{together in the same}} match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a novelty. Only in the West Indies and India were there significant numbers of coloured cricketers playing. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, an Indian prince (universally known as Ranji), had been playing in English cricket for a few years but otherwise coloured cricketers were rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|From 1990 through 1994, NBC only {{televised}} the All Star Game. NBC reportedly {{wanted to}} test the appeal of hockey, having recently lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS. Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E

25|$|The San Antonio Spurs {{started out}} as the Dallas Chaparrals of the {{original}} version of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Coached by player/coach Cliff Hagan the Dallas Chaparrals were one of 11 teams to take {{the floor in the}} inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps second season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a disappointment, as the team finished in 4th place with a mediocre 41–37 record. In the playoffs the Chaparrals quickly fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he {{converted}} {{himself into}} an opener. While there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{competition for the}} Indian middle order, Pankaj Roy was coming {{to the end of}} his career as an opener. In that position, Jaisimha scored Test hundreds against England in 1961–62 and 1963–64, and 134 against Ceylon in 1964–65. In the 1963–64 series against England he made 444 runs. In 1964–65, he batted in the middle order for Hyderabad and hit 713 runs. But failures in the Test matches led to him being dropped.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 the Gold Star <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{a veteran}} Q-Ship dealing with {{communications}} intelligence {{as she moved}} from port to port and while in port. As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This all started in 1933 during {{the reconstruction of the}} Japanese fleet by Tokyo. The Gold Star along with ground stations in Guam, Olongapo and Beijing provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|E

25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|Michael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in {{the fourth}} quarter-final of the C Trophy. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> an {{implosion}} from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, {{but it was too}} little, too late.|$|E

[...] Richardson would recite his lines in [...] "a {{sinister}} way and do under-the-eyebrows stuff", which Richardson felt inspired the writers to develop Ste's character more deeply.|$|E

500|$|David Reinhard of The Oregonian {{commented on}} the criticism: [...] "Hollywood sharpsters can always make a group from the great American {{hinterland}} look ridiculous when it zeroes in on one show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of The Simpsons as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans." [...] After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found {{in a study of}} prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars.|$|E
500|$|Delays {{were caused}} {{as a result}} of manufacturing. This may cause the pavilions to stay on exhibit until November. Additionally, the Hadid Pavilion may be {{situated}} in {{a different part of the}} park for part of 2010. [...] The choices of Hadid and van Berkel were somewhat controversial because Burnham was a classicist and they are both avant-garde modernists. [...] Additionally, local architects complained that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a slight that two European architects were chosen to produce works to serve as the focal points of the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration. [...] The pavilions were scheduled to be a focal point of the centennial celebration of the 1909 Plan of Chicago, which is a yearlong celebration. [...] However, Hadid's Pavilion encountered manufacturer's difficulty in executing Hadid's complex, computer-aided design.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} the European and Japanese legs {{of their}} tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of Holy Wood coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion {{at his home}} in the Hollywood Hills, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> trepidation, [...] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face... there were {{not a lot of people}} who stood behind me." [...] He told Alternative Press that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he [...] "could be shot Mark David Chapman-style." [...] He began work on the album as a counterattack.|$|E

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss – I've just got to live with {{the fact that it was}} me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|E
500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had plenty of good moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a waste of time." ...|$|E

500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels {{they have to}} go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to me ... He had a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E
500|$|... "You and I", {{written by}} Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Gaga and Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, {{was one of}} the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played [...] "You and I" [...] at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "rock-and-roll tune" [...] and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and Ann Curry that [...] "'You and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met", allegedly Lüc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
