500|$|Some of Gibbons's poetry {{expressed}} {{her love}} of nature and a prophetic awareness for environmental issues such as sea pollution, decades before [...] such concerns became fashionable. In a critical summary of Gibbons's poems, Loralee MacPike has described them as [...] "slight lyrics... tend toward classic, even archaic, diction, and only occasionally... show flashes of the novels' wit". [...] Such lines as [...] "my thoughts, like purple parrots / Brood / In the sick light" [...] come dangerously close indeed to the overblown rhetoric she satirized in Cold Comfort Farm: [...] "How like yaks <b>were</b> <b>your</b> drowsy thoughts".|$|E

Debbie Cook, who spent seven weeks in the Hole in 2007, said that [...] "most of the time the activities [...] were either you confessing your own sins or bad things that you'd done, or getting other people to confess theirs." [...] Mike Rinder commented on the bizarre personal dynamics of the Hole: [...] "These <b>were</b> <b>your</b> friends, people you had traveled with. But then, you get in the Hole? You can't trust anybody." ...|$|E

Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we <b>were</b> <b>your</b> only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me as if I <b>were</b> <b>your</b> brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They <b>were</b> <b>your</b> classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

They also recorded Ashford & Simpson's [...] "Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)" [...] in 1969.

Another ballad, the self-composed [...] "I Don't Want to Do Wrong", became another million-selling single. Both singles were featured on their first number one album, also titled If I <b>Were</b> <b>Your</b> Woman. In late 1971, they released a soulful version of Kris Kristofferson's [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night", which became an international hit. The group released the Jim Weatherly ballad, [...] "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)", in December 1972, the single would become their last single released while still with the label. While the single was charting, the group tried to negotiate a better contract with Motown. Negotiations fell through weeks later and, in February 1973, the group left Motown and signed with Buddah Records. [...] "Neither One of Us" [...] became their biggest selling single at Motown, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning the group their first Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it <b>were</b> <b>your</b> arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).|$|E
