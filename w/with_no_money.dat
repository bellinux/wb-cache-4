5|$|I cannot help being displeased, {{that this}} {{valuable}} observation, purchasable <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> elegantly described {{and prepared for}} the press, should have laid for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should {{have been found to}} take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country's credit and for the advantage of mankind.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship, but Fanny haughtily tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> Mrs. Dashwood understands her meaning completely.|$|E
5|$|There was at {{the time}} a boom in shares in South American mining companies. Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of George Canning the British {{government}} recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> of his own, Disraeli borrowed money to invest. He became involved with the financier J. D. Powles, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining boom. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> no place to go, and did not know where to turn.

Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> for him, he gives him a rosary instead.

5|$|He {{introduced}} massages {{and changed}} the canteen and team kit for the 1979–80 campaign. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E

5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock.
