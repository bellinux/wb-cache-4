[...] "In the summer, we're {{going to get back}} and start a new record. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> out a record nearly every year, every year and a half," [...] Niall Horan said, revealing they were arranging [...] "meetings and stuff with different writers and producers."

500|$|U2's {{delivery}} of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, {{because they were}} not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: [...] "For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it to the street with that same spirit." [...] Island/PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Babys five singles. The first single [...] "Numb" [...] was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a [...] "video single". The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.|$|E
