5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property.

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only to be used by the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, {{to avoid the}} excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model {{was added to the}} range.|$|E

In December 1991, CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. CSU also issued a forecast in April, June and August, however no revisions <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> numbers of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricane predicted in 1992.|$|E
