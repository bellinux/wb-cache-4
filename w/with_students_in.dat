40|$|Multilevel {{modeling}} {{has become}} a common analytic technique {{across a variety of}} disciplines including education and other social and behavioral sciences. Such models are often used when researchers examine relationships between school and/or neighborhood characteristics and some individual-level outcome (e. g., academic achievement, high school completion). Although many samples are theoretically cross-classified between multiple level- 2 units, the application of cross-classified random effects models is rare in such research.
