5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E

This miner, who name was Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, {{is better known}} as El Pípila, who had joined the insurgent army as it passed through his hometown. El Pípila’s strapped a large flat stone over his back and carrying a flask of tar and a torch, crawled towards the main entrance. The stone protected him from the bullets fired at him. When he reached the heavy wooden door of the entrance, he smeared it with tar and lit it. This allowed insurgents to then take the building.|$|E
25|$|From its mistakes, and the Australians' discoveries, U.S. command {{realized}} that they needed a new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. They began training an elite group of volunteers {{in the art of}} tunnel warfare, armed only with a gun, a knife, a flashlight and a piece of string. These specialists, commonly known as “tunnel rats”, would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for this approach and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and MACV (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) to provide some sort of training and resources, this was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped and planned for themselves.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{how most}} actors are trained, St. John {{believed}} that it was not up to the performer to interpret the character, but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him, which he realized was [...] "an unusual <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> acting". [...] He also thought that playing Todd was fun and [...] "never boring to watch" [...] because Todd, although popular with the audience, is an unlikable character. St. John told Branco that when people asked him if Todd was capable of harming his loved ones, like his long-time love Blair or daughter Starr, St. John would say that Todd was capable of anything, even being sexually attracted to Starr or one of her friends, because to state otherwise meant that he was [...] "limiting the character". He added, [...] "Todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide, or find a cure for AIDS. He's full of possibilities—good and bad...

500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah.

Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun to put myself in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E
500|$|Cult {{films are}} often {{approached}} {{in terms of}} auteur theory, which states that the director's creative vision drives a film. [...] This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics. [...] Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult. [...] According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> avant-garde film criticism. [...] Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship. [...] By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans. [...] Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream. [...] Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs. [...] This may {{take the place of}} – and even ignore – political readings of the director. [...] Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture. [...] While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation. [...] Someone like George Romero, whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.|$|E
