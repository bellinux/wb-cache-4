Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship sometimes. We put our foot in our mouths and <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth and you go, 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E
500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} {{to remind us of}} our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia {{focused on}} the single cover and concept of the song. She said [...] "While {{the idea of the}} track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said [...] " [...] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy." [...] She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song [...] "Poo". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. [...] "The track begins with the singer insisting, [...] "I'm taking back my love." [...] Personally, <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds." [...] Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying [...] "J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high-heels just seems a little sad. I say focus on getting the movie career back on track..." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Disney Channel's {{most popular}} and {{successful}} original shows, Kim Possible remains the project for which Schooley and McCorkle are best known. Few anticipated Kim Possible would become as successful as it ultimately did, proving popular among {{both male and female}} audiences. Explaining Kim Possibles universal appeal, the creators said, [...] "Whenever there's an action complement to a show, boys get excited, and when Kim does her martial arts and when she's doing one of these incredible stunts, boys love to watch it ... And {{one of the things that}} we’ve always found is that boys of any age ... love humour and characters that are a little goofy, sort of silly and weird. When we tested it, the kids were like: 'Oh, Ron's stupid funny' and that became sort of a buzz phrase." [...] Ron's role helped maintain a strong male audience throughout the series. Kim Possible was greeted with a level of enthusiasm that had not been experienced since the Disney Afternoon Lineup, becoming Disney Channel's most successful post-1990s show. Disney Channel Worldwide President Rich Ross extolled Kim Possible as a [...] "stand-out" [...] among both the network's live-action and animated catalogue. The series maintains [...] "legions" [...] of devoted fans. A poll conducted by Disney Channel revealed that Kim Possible viewers voted for Season 3's [...] "Emotion Sickness" [...] as their favorite episode of the series. Entertainment Weekly ranked Kim Possible fourth on its list of the 25 greatest Disney Channel Original Series, calling it an [...] "animated gem". Kim Possible was placed at number nine on TV Guides ranking of [...] "The Best Disney Channel Shows". MTV ranked Kim Possible 13th in its article [...] "15 Disney Channel Series <b>We</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>We</b> Could Watch Again". The theme song [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] became so popular among fans of both the show and Milian herself that several of them proceeded to download it as their own cell phone ringtones.|$|E

2500|$|With {{almost the}} entire team {{returning}} for the 2012–13 season, expectations were high, and the Bears were ranked #13 in the AP pre-season poll, their highest ranking since 2009. The Bears more than {{lived up to the}} expectations, compiling a 32-4 season record, and ending the regular season with a #6 ranking. The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford. Cal's victory broke an 81-game conference winning streak for the Cardinal. Gottlieb led the Bears to a 17-1 conference record, making them Pac-12 Conference co-Champions—the first conference championship in California Women's Basketball history. The Bears earned a second seed in the NCAA tournament, the Bears' highest tournament seed ever. They defeated Fresno State 90-76 in the first round, and downed South Florida in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen {{for only the second time}} in school history. The Bears beat LSU to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time, and then earned their first trip to the Final Four trip with a thrilling 65-62 overtime victory over Andy Landers' Georgia Bulldogs at the Spokane Arena in Spokane, WA. [...] A tough loss to Louisville in the national semifinal game concluded the team's extraordinary season. [...] "What I said to our team in the locker room is that we can be disappointed about a half a basketball that <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> had back. We could be disappointed to not be playing on Tuesday night," [...] Gottlieb said.

An article by GamesRadar staff of the [...] "12 PAX East games <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> were still playing" [...] included VA-11 HALL-A; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how [...] "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", {{as well as the}} [...] "wildly different directions" [...] the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, now that I know such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week.
