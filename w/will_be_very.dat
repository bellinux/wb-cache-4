5|$|Oscars {{will often}} {{lay claim to}} {{an area of the}} {{aquarium}} and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> aggressive towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside the aquarium or lake. The size of the territory varies depending on the size and aggressiveness of the fish based on its surroundings. Once the oscar establishes a territory, it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{conventional}} probability density (referenced to a linear scale rather than log scale, i.e. P(x)dx rather than P(log x) d(log x)), the equivalent criterion is that Benford's law <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> accurately satisfied when P(x) is approximately proportional to 1/x over several orders-of-magnitude variation in x.|$|E

My dear, I wish {{particularly}} to impress upon you and dear Katie (to whom I send my other best love) that I hope your stay <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long. I don't think it very good for either of you, though of course I know that Lotty <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> and must be, and {{should be the first}} consideration with you both.

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that, for most players, aluminium or composite sticks make for harder slap shots.

25|$|Since the {{possible}} nodes for each k-bucket decreases quickly (because there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> few nodes that are that close), the lower bit k-buckets will fully map all nodes in {{that section of}} the network. Since the quantity of possible IDs is much larger than any node population can ever be, some of the k-buckets corresponding to very short distances will remain empty.|$|E
25|$|However, one of {{the leading}} {{environmental}} organizations in Panama, the National Association for Nature Conservation (ANCON), says that the studies and projections of operations of the third set of locks, including the water-saving basins, credibly state that there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low levels of salinization of waters of Gatun Lake and that these levels will preserve the biological separation of the oceans while safekeeping biodiversity and water quality for human use.|$|E
25|$|The proportional, integral, and {{differential}} {{terms of}} the two controllers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all {{the water in the}} tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system it controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{to pay attention}} to homilies from the doctrinal point of view and with the “gift of tongues”. For many faithful, the Sunday Holy Mass, with its Homily, is the only occasion where they will hear the message of Christ.

25|$|Citizens of {{all other}} {{countries}} may obtain a visa for Uganda on arrival. As of 22 July 2016, the price is US $50. Electronic visas are expected to replace the visa on arrival facility. As a temporary measure, passengers who have not applied for an e-visa on line, will {{still be able to}} apply for their e-visa on arrival in Uganda. However, facilities <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> limited and passengers may experience delays.Holders of consular, diplomatic, official, service or special passports of any country can obtain a visa on arrival for 3 months.|$|E

Rolling the pitch can take a long time but <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective once done, rolling of the pitch is crucial to whether it is better for a batsmen or a bowler.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} methods {{available}} for C-terminal amino acid analysis {{is much smaller}} than the number of available methods of N-terminal analysis. The most common method is to add carboxypeptidases to a solution of the protein, take samples at regular intervals, and determine the terminal amino acid by analysing a plot of amino acid concentrations against time. This method <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful in the case of polypeptides and protein-blocked N termini. C-terminal sequencing would greatly help in verifying the primary structures of proteins predicted from DNA sequences and to detect any postranslational processing of gene products from known codon sequences.|$|E
25|$|Akitas {{tend to take}} a {{socially}} dominant role with other dogs, and thus caution must be used in situations when Akitas {{are likely to be}} around other dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In particular, Akitas tend to be less tolerant of dogs of the same sex. For this reason, Akitas, unless highly socialized, are not generally well-suited for off-leash dog parks. The Akita is said to be careful, courageous, fearless, and intelligent. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a confident, consistent handler, without which the dog <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals.|$|E
25|$|Finite gain: Open-loop gain is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop gain (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where closed-loop gain must be very high, the feedback gain <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|E
