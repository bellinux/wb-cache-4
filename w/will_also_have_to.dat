Team Plasma is led by N, {{a young man who}} was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E

25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
25|$|The Standards in Public Office Commission {{was asked}} to {{investigate}} the Taoiseach's declaration of tax compliance after the 2002 general election. In mid-January 2008 it emerged in the press, reportedly as leaks from parties to the Mahon tribunal, that Ahern {{would not be in}} a position to present a Tax Clearance Certificate to the Dáil, as required under Ethics' legislation. This certificate is issued by the Revenue Commissioners, to persons who have shown themselves to be tax compliant. To meet legal requirements, this certificate should have been presented to a Dáil committee by 31 January 2008 by all those elected to the Dáil. A caveat allowed that in the absence of this, a certificate stating that the Dáil member was in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners would suffice. An inability to declare tax compliance by a prominent individual, such as Ahern, would prove highly embarrassing, and could potentially have had more serious repercussions. The Standards in Public Office Act (2001) determines the tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas, and others. The making of a false declaration will be an offence. They <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> produce a tax clearance certificate. There will, therefore, be considerable policing of tax compliance of members.|$|E

The Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) has acted to [...] "ring-fence" [...] the Icelandic operations of Landsbanki and Glitnir, stating its aim of [...] "continued banking operations for Icelandic families and businesses". NBI (originally known as Nýi Landsbanki) was set up on 9 October with 200 billion krónur in equity and 2,300 billion krónur of assets. Nýi Glitnir was set up on 15 October with 110 billion krónur in equity and 1,200 billion krónur of assets. Nýja Kaupþing was set up on 22 October with 75 billion krónur in equity and 700 billion krónur of assets. The equity in all three new banks was supplied by the Icelandic government, and amounted to 30% of Iceland's GDP.

Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observers issue of 5 November 1939 which began, [...] "No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a [...] trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers {{is one of the}} very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure." [...] After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, [...] "Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roberto Mignani at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Milan who led {{the team}} of astronomers has commented that [...] "“When Einstein {{came up with the}} theory of general {{relativity}} 100 years ago, he had no idea that it would be used for navigational systems. The consequences of this discovery probably <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be realised on a longer timescale.” The team found that visible light from the star had undergone linear polarisation of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through interstellar gas or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At X-ray wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%. Although no telescope currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may soon be able to verify the result conclusively such as ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), China's Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).|$|E
2500|$|Onshore wind investors <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get prior {{approval}} for their projects under the Federal Immission Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetzes or BlmSchG), {{the federal law}} regulating {{the harmful effects of}} air pollution, noise, vibration and similar phenomena. [...] Citizens cooperatives (Genossenschaft) participating in wind energy tenders have special dispensations. [...] Wind energy auctions will be held more often in the beginning, with three in 2017 and four in 2018, in order to quickly establish a price level. [...] The annual capacity for onshore wind farms will be set at 2.8GW per year for 2017 to 2019 and at 2.9GW thereafter. [...] In order to better synchronise the development of the grid with renewables growth, the addition of onshore wind will be restricted to specified 'grid congestion zones' where high inputs of renewable electricity cannot be accepted because of network congestion. [...] These areas are to be identified by the Federal Network Agency. [...] The new rules on funding offshore wind farms will apply to those projects that commence operation in 2021 or later. [...] From 2025, the government will specify the sites for future wind farms and investors will then compete for the right to build at those locations. [...] This centralised (Danish) model is designed to ensure competition and to make project approvals, site planning, and network connections more cost effective and better integrated. [...] Between 2021 and 2024 a transitional auction model will be used and wind farms that have been planned and approved but not built will compete in two rounds of tenders for a restricted amount of capacity. [...] Offshore wind will remain capped at 15GW by 2030 and the capacity auctioned each year will be consistent with this target. [...] In 2021, only wind farms in the Baltic Sea will be considered, due to a shortage of network connections at the North Sea. [...] Biomass projects will also participate in the new auction system. [...] Biomass capacity is to be expanded by 150MW annually in the next three years and by 200MW annually for the following three years. [...] Installations with a capacity greater than 150kW will also be able to tender. [...] Biomass facilities will only receive remuneration for half their runtime in order to incentivize their use during times of high electricity prices. [...] Hydroelectricity, geothermal, and mine, landfill, and sewage gas are excluded from the auction system because of the prospect of insufficient competition.|$|E
