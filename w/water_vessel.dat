5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski's personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper <b>water</b> <b>vessel,</b> his Gasser revolver, made in Austria–Hungary in 1869, and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski's sabre {{can be seen in}} the Lovech regional museum.|$|E
5|$|Each page of {{the codex}} has been painted on one side with a {{standing}} figure facing left. Each figure holds a weapon and most grip a rope leading to a restrained captive. Colours used on the codex include hematite red, black, blue-green, a red wash and a brown wash, all upon a strong white background. The left-hand side of each page {{is marked by a}} column of day signs; where this column is complete these total thirteen in all. Each day sign is associated with a bar-and-dot numerical coefficient. Six pages depict a figure bearing weapons and accompanied by a captive (pages 1–4, 6 and 9), two pages (5 and 8) both depict a figure hurling a dart at a temple. Page 7 of the codex shows a passive warrior {{standing in front of a}} tree. Page 11 depicts a death god with a javelin, pointing his weapon at a <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> containing a snail. Page 10 is a badly damaged fragment with the subject largely obliterated. Based on the surviving portion, Michael Coe thought it depicted a standing figure wearing a waterbird headdress and bearing an atlatl. The figures represented on each page differ from those on the other Maya codices and are far more similar to the Mixtec codices and Toltec art styles of central Mexico. The heads of the death gods painted in the Grolier Codex are almost identical to those represented in the Laud Codex and Fejérváry-Mayer Codex, including the red colouring of the portion of the teeth closest to the gums.|$|E

25|$|In its closed position, a {{swing bridge}} {{carrying}} a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> needs {{to pass the}} bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel.|$|E
25|$|In a fireless {{locomotive}} {{the boiler}} {{is replaced by}} a steam accumulator, which is charged with steam (actually water at a temperature well above boiling point, 212°F/100°C) from a stationary boiler. Fireless locomotives were used where there was a high fire risk (e.g. in oil refineries), where cleanliness was important (e.g. in food factories) or where steam is readily available (e.g. in paper mills and power stations where steam is either a by-product or is cheaply available). The <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> ("boiler") is heavily insulated the same as with a fired locomotive. Until all the water has boiled away, the steam pressure does not drop except as the temperature drops.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} Columbanus are {{preserved}} in the crypt at Bobbio Abbey. Many miracles have been credited to his intercession. In 1482, the relics were placed in a new shrine and laid beneath the altar of the crypt.

2500|$|Arak {{is usually}} mixed in {{proportions}} of approximately one third arak and two thirds {{water in a}} traditional Eastern Mediterranean <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> called Abarik, Arabic abarīq then the mixture is poured into small, ice-filled cups. This dilution causes the clear liquor to turn a translucent milky-white color; this is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is soluble in alcohol but not in water. This results in an emulsion, whose fine droplets scatter the light and turn the liquid translucent, a phenomenon known as louching. Arak is commonly served with mezza, which may [...] include dozens of small traditional dishes. In general, arak drinkers prefer to consume it this way, rather than alone. It is also consumed with barbecues, along with garlic sauce.|$|E
