5|$|In {{preparation}} for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Europe. One {{of these was}} the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units {{in and out of}} the area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a scouting trip to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a poor period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make an impression on the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, {{with an emphasis on}} passing and possession of the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E

Not {{only was the}} women's {{suffrage}} movement gaining momentum in Canada and calls <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prairies for socialist changes to the governmental system, but war continued to rage around the world. Canada was providing troops and supplies, and shortly after his installation, acting {{on the advice of}} Borden, Devonshire introduced conscription, a decision that was particularly divisive between French and English Canadians and sparked the Conscription Crisis of 1917. In the same year, the Governor General also travelled to Nova Scotia to survey the damage caused by the Halifax Explosion on 6 December; there he met with survivors and addressed the women of the Voluntary Aid Detachment.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story.

[...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.'

500|$|By 22:15, Lützow had shipped nearly 2,400tons of water, and {{the ship}} was dangerously down by the bows. After midnight, {{attempts}} were made to steer the ship in reverse. This failed when the bow became submerged enough to bring the stern out of the water; by 02:20, the screws and both rudders <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water {{and the ship}} was no longer able to steer. The order to abandon ship was given, and at 02:47, Lützow was sunk by the torpedo boat [...] The ship was lost because the flooding in the bow could not be controlled; the forward pump system failed and the central system could not keep up with the rising water. The crew was picked up by four torpedo boats that had been escorting the crippled battlecruiser; during the battle the ship suffered 116 men killed.|$|E

500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone. The song was recorded at Sound Works Studios in Astoria, New York, and samples a hook from LL Cool J's single, [...] "Jingling Baby" [...] (1990). Pettibone also did the sequencing, the keyboard arrangement and the programming for the track with Shimkin. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock were the recording engineers for the track while George Karras was the mixing engineer. Ted Jensen did the mastering for the song with Mark Goodman as assistant engineer. Background vocals were provided by Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. For [...] "Bye Bye Baby", Madonna and Pettibone wanted a 1940s theme, which would make the vocals sound as if they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an antique radio. In order to achieve that, they used a Pultec HLF filter. Shimkin recalled that the vocals for [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] were from the first take.

Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime.

2500|$|In the U.S., [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] {{was issued}} as the album's first single, with an {{accompanying}} music video. Initially, the album and single lingered {{for almost a}} year without performing well, but when Geffen founder David Geffen was asked to lend support to the band, he obliged, personally convincing MTV executives to play [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] during the network's after-hours rotation. Even though the video was initially only played once at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, heavy metal and hard rock fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse. The song, written in Seattle, was about Los Angeles. The music video took place in New York. According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a homeless man while they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a bus into New York. Trying to put a scare into the young runaways, the man yelled at them, [...] "You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby; you're gonna die!"

2500|$|Murphy {{received}} principal {{credit for}} the dominance of American athletes between the 1890s and the Stockholm Olympics. The praise for Murphy {{was so great that}} a backlash developed among westerners who felt that, though many of the country's greatest athletes <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Midwest, the Eastern establishment sought to heap all of the credit on Murphy. For example, during the 1912 Olympics, the Minneapolis Journal noted that Murphy was not responsible for developing Midwestern stars Jim Thorpe and Ralph Craig and wrote:"They are still at it down East, attempting to grab off the glory for the splendid work of the American athletes in the Olympic games as the personal due of Mike Murphy. ... Mike Murphy is unquestionably a great trainer, but he falls far short of deserving all the {{credit for the}} winning of the Olympic games. ... It is an injustice to other less-famed trainers to have their products blandly attributed to Murphy as some of the eastern writers, with their usual provincial complacency, are doing. Murphy is big enough and well enough known by past performances as a trainer to stand upon his own merits without having his misguided friends attempt to seize for him leaves of a bay rightfully belonging to other men." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading.

2500|$|By August 10, {{excavation}} work {{was two weeks}} ahead of schedule, and 80 percent complete. All foundation work {{was expected to be}} finished by December 1. Engineers said that digging would stop when it reached [...] below grade, at which point 1,100 wells would begin a two-week period of draining water from the site. Once drainage was complete, the site would be excavated another [...] Excavation was expected to end in mid-October. Pumping began on August 25. Initially, drainage went well. The water table dropped by [...] by September 9, and {{excavation work}} was expected to resume on September 13. However, heavy silt prevented the wells from functioning correctly, and by October 10 excavation had still not resumed. A protracted dispute between Hunkin-Conkey and the city broke out. Hunkin-Conkey claimed that it knew the contractually-specified method of dewatering the site would not work, but the city was insistent. The firm also expressed concern that the drainage system specified for below the foundation would not work, either. With 850 wellpoints in operation, the water table had been lowered [...] Another [...] remained, but only [...] per minute <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wells, rather than the required [...] per minute. The excavation was now six weeks behind schedule, incurring a $2,000-a-day loss ($ per day in [...] dollars). Hunkin-Conkey refused to incur additional costs, and demanded that the city or the architect pay for a new means of dewatering the site. But the city argued that the contract required Hunkin-Conkey to incur the cost, and that the company could have added more wellpoints or contracted out the dewatering but chose neither. Mayor Celebrezze suggested that Hunkin-Conkey merely install 200 more wellpoints, a relatively inexpensive solution that would cost between $4,000 and $6,000. But Hunkin-Conkey now claimed they had 1,100 wells in operation, and additional wellpoints would not matter. Hunkin-Conkey declined to install the wellpoints, and sarcastically asked the mayor to specify exactly where the wells should be installed. By December 2, there was still no movement on the drainage issue, and the project was two months behind.|$|E
