5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal than they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> reality.|$|E

Instead of having eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed {{the ball into the}} scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.|$|E

5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of the Underworld {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to the Underworld by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying the Pillar, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope with it. In God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace and her voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{challenge to}} naval artillery was {{the advent of}} aircraft and armour piercing/incendiary bombs, {{which could be used}} against land based targets in support of troop formations ashore. Although in its infancy during and after World War I, some saw the potential for aircraft and sea based air support and envisioned the role it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> future conflicts. Among the more notable individuals within the United States was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell had served in World War I, where he eventually commanded all U.S. aircraft in the war and was responsible for leading Allied aircraft in support of the ground offensive during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, one of the first coordinated air-ground offensives in history. Mitchell's experience in World War I led him to believe that battleships were out of date, and he became an increasingly vocal proponent of air power.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's {{original}} plan for 16 June {{was based on}} the assumption that the Coalition forces, who had been caught napping, would not attempt a risky forward concentration; and he intended therefore to push an advance guard as far as Gembloux, for the purpose of feeling for and warding off Blücher. To assist this operation the reserve would move at first to Fleurus to reinforce Grouchy, should he need assistance in driving back Blücher's troops; but, once in possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon would swing the reserve westwards and join Ney, who, it was supposed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the meantime mastered Quatre Bras.|$|E

However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the {{most expensive}} city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place. Critics of their methodology argue that this survey replicates the lifestyle that a senior executive <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Washington DC, counting certain very expensive brand name foreign goods, but disregarding the many lines that are far cheaper in Russia, e.g. household staff, drivers, nannies, etc.|$|E
25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their place.|$|E
25|$|American Communications Association v. Douds was {{the first}} {{important}} test of loyalty oaths in the U.S. Supreme Court. A year later, the Court relied heavily on Douds oath-as-predictor-of-future-action rationale in upholding a local government loyalty test in Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951). The divided court in Douds anticipated the difficulty the Supreme Court <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the coming years, during which time it usually upheld loyalty oaths but found no clear test or rule for doing so. The case {{was also the first}} time the Court applied a balancing test to indirect restrictions on free speech, a test the Court would consistently apply in many similar cases in the future. But the balancing test itself has been criticized as offering little guidance to future courts, not enough protection to First Amendment rights, and too much deference to the legislature.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additions}} {{had been}} built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and {{though it was not}} situated in a north-south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> order, pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior hallways, and some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.|$|E
