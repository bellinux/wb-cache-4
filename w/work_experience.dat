These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (<b>Work</b> <b>Experience)</b> Act, allowing LEAs to organise <b>work</b> <b>experience</b> for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Bostwick {{began his}} career as a trainee with Millwall, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, as well as playing several times for the reserve team. During the latter stages of the 2005–06 season, Bostwick joined Conference National club Crawley Town on <b>work</b> <b>experience.</b> The move counted as <b>work</b> <b>experience,</b> as opposed to a loan, because of Bostwick's age – {{subsequently}} he could not appear for the first team of another Football League club, but was eligible to play for the first team of a non-league club. He made his debut for Crawley a week after joining the club, coming on as an 89th minute substitute in a 1–0 victory against Forest Green Rovers. He came on in the 83rd minute in the following match against Southport at Haig Avenue, as well as playing for 25 minutes against Burton Albion, setting up Tony Scully's 89th-minute equaliser. He subsequently started his first match in April 2006, playing the whole match in a 2–0 win against Aldershot Town, scoring Crawley's second. A week later, Bostwick scored both of Crawley's goals in the club's 2–2 draw against Halifax Town, netting in quick succession to give Crawley a two-goal lead. He played a total of eight matches for Crawley during his two-month <b>work</b> <b>experience,</b> scoring three times. On return to his parent club in May 2006, Bostwick signed a one-year contract with Millwall. Shortly before the start of the 2006–07 season, Bostwick was loaned out to Crawley Town for a second spell at the club. He played in the club's first five matches of the season, scoring twice from midfield in a 3–2 away win at Stevenage. In late August 2006, Crawley Town extended the loan deal until the end of the season, although Millwall were able to recall him in the January transfer window if they deemed it necessary. Bostwick played a total of 25 times during the first half of the season, scoring twice, before Millwall recalled him in January 2007.|$|E
