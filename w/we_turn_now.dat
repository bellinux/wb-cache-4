60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to {{two other}} actors in our tale, who, {{although}} not very important characters, deserve passing notice.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> must <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> {{to another}} part of those western wilds, not far from the little hut or {{fortress}} named.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> must <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to poor Lancey, {{from whom}} I parted {{in the waters}} of the Danube, but with whose fate and doings I did not become acquainted until long afterwards.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to {{our main}} focus.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now,</b> dear?" [...] he said. [...] "We {{have walked}} far enough in this sun. You shall {{tell me more}} of Ulric another day." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to a battlefield, but we won't affect {{to believe}} that the reader does not know {{who is one of the}} chief heroes of that field.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to the Talisman, which, {{it will be}} remembered, we left {{making her}} way slowly through the reefs towards the {{northern}} end of the island, under the pilotage of Gascoyne.|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to {{the second}} hypothesis.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to {{the concept}} {{introduced}} by Branciari.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to {{the proof}} of Theorem  1.2.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to Beniah the Hebrew. On {{arriving}} at the Hot Swamp he was amazed to find the change {{that had been made}} in the appearance of the locality in so short a time.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> {{to a very}} {{different}} scene. It is a small fort or trading-post {{on the banks of}} a stream which flows through the prairie. The fort is very much like the one which has been already described, but somewhat stronger; and there are four block-houses or bastions, one at each corner, from which the muzzles of a few heavy guns may be seen protruding.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> to [...] "the enemy"--the McLeods. The {{father and}} his two sons sat in a rude shanty, on a bench and an empty keg, {{drinking}} tea out of tin cans. They were all stalwart, dark-haired, grave-visaged mountaineers of Scotland. Unitedly they would have measured at least eighteen feet of humanity. The only difference between {{the father and the}} sons was that a few silver hairs mingled with the black on the head of the former, and a rougher skin covered his countenance. In other respects he seemed but an elder brother.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> back <b>now</b> {{from the}} {{atmospheric}} to the aqueous ocean. Yet so intimate is {{the connection between}} the two, that we shall find it impossible to avoid occasional reference to the former.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> our {{attention}} to the “early warning” problem.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> to the {{specification}} {{of the actual}} maximizer.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> {{to a very}} {{different}} scene--to a West End drawing-room, in {{which is to be}} found every appliance, in the way of comfort and luxurious ease, that ingenuity can devise or labour produce. An exceedingly dignified, large, self-possessed yet respectful footman, with magnificent calves in white stockings, has placed a silver tray, with three tiny cups and a tiny teapot thereon, near to the hand of a beautiful middle-aged lady--the mistress of the mansion. She is reading a letter with evident interest. A girl of seventeen, whose style of beauty tells of the closest relationship, sits beside her, eagerly awaiting the news which is evidently contained in the letter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> {{to a very}} {{different}} scene--the pier and harbour of Ramsgate. The storm-fiend is abroad. Thick clouds of a dark leaden hue drive athwart a sky of dingy grey, ever varying their edges, and rolling out limbs and branches in random fashion, {{as if they were}} fleeing before the wind in abject terror. The wind, however, is chiefly in the sky as yet. Down below there are only fitful puffs now and then, telling of something else in store. The sea is black, with sufficient swell on it to cause a few crested waves here and there to gleam intensely white by contrast. It is early in the day, nevertheless there is a peculiar darkness in the atmosphere which suggests the approach of night. Numerous vessels in the offing are making with all speed for Ramsgate harbour, which is truly and deservedly named a [...] "harbour of refuge," [...] for already some two dozen ships of considerable size, and a large fleet of small craft, have sought and found shelter on a coast which in certain conditions of the wind is fraught with danger. About the stores near the piers, Trinity men are busy with buoys, anchors, and cables; elsewhere labourers are toiling, idlers are loafing, and lifeboat--men are lounging about, leaning on the parapets, looking wistfully out to sea, with and without telescopes, from the sheer force of habit, and commenting on the weather. The broad, bronzed, storm-battered coxswain of the celebrated Ramsgate lifeboat, who seems to possess the power of feeding and growing strong on hardship and exposure, is walking about {{at the end of the}} east pier, contemplating the horizon in the direction of the Goodwin Sands with the serious air of a man who expects ere long to be called into action.|$|E
