5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can <b>we</b> <b>eat?),</b> which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{family went}} to Kanitz's {{paternal}} grandfather's home. His grandparents, Shamu and Gisella (Weiss) Kanitz, {{had been taken}} to Auschwitz and their home had been ransacked, so there was nothing inside, and no food available anywhere. [...] "There were dead horses lying in the streets, and people were carving them up where they lay and taking the meat home. And that's what we lived on ... <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> horse, <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> donkey, <b>we</b> <b>ate,</b> I don't know what else we ate." [...] The Kanitzs discovered that 100 members {{of the extended family}} had been killed.|$|R

25|$|Runoff {{can also}} induce heavy metal {{poisoning}} in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans. These metals are ingested by ocean life. These heavy metals cannot be disposed so they accumulate within the animals. Over time, these metals {{build up to}} a toxic level, and the animal dies. This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans. If <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> a poisoned animal, {{we have a chance}} of getting heavy metal poisoning too.|$|E

And <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> {{every part of the}} sweet potato plant, from the leaf to the tip of the root…For protein, <b>we</b> <b>ate</b> beetles, beetle larvae, and other insects that we found at the roots of the plants we picked, which we roasted or mashed. Even in the countryside, food was scarce." ...|$|R
25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return the fish to the water (e.g., if <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; <b>we</b> <b>eat</b> and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based {{programs}} {{have become increasingly}} important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community {{as a means of}} helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that <b>we</b> <b>eat.</b> Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|E
