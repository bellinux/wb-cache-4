However, in 2010 the Brazilian Navy contracted Marsh Aviation to convert four S-2T to Airborne Early <b>Warning</b> <b>configuration,</b> and upgrading four additional Grumman C-1 Trader for tanking and Carrier Onboard Delivery duties. The latter are scheduled to be back in service by 2015. They will operate from the successor of Minas Gerais, NAe São Paulo.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} {{approach to}} multi-objective optimization is introduced, using a message-passing algorithm {{to sample the}} Pareto set, i. e. the set of Pareto-non-dominated solutions. Several heuristics are proposed and tested on a simple bi-objective 3 -SAT problem. The first one {{is based on a}} straightforward deformation of the Survey-Propagation (SP) equation to locally encode a Pareto trade-off. A simple heuristic is then tested, which combines an elimination procedure of clauses with the usual decimation of variables used in the SP algorithm, and is able to sample different regions of the Pareto-front. We study in more details the compliance of these deformed equations with basic Belief-Propagation (BP) properties. This first leads to an explicit Markov Random Field (MRF) of valid <b>warning</b> <b>configuration,</b> for which the SP equations are basic BP equations. This observation is then generalized to the multi-objective context. Numerical experiments on artificial problems up to 100000 variables are presented and discussed...|$|E

The aircraft remained in position for about 5 minutes and at this time the cabin crew walked the aisles to calm passengers. The flight attendants from Norwegian Air Shuttle expected another call by the cockpit crew to take their seats prior to takeoff, however, suddenly the engines accelerated for takeoff and the aircraft departed with the cabin crew rushing to their seats. The aircraft stopped the climb at FL150 (usual cruise level FL260) the crew received a cabin altitude warning and levelled off at low altitude, it was later found the air conditioning systems had not been activated.|$|R

Installation of firewalls, antivirus, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) / IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and various other security applications often require the best available installation cost is not small. Open source is the best solution to address the security issues that expensive. Intrusion Detection System is a system designed to collect information about the activities in the network, analyzing information, and give a warning. Snort, Bro and Suricata is an open source Intrusion Detection System. By comparing how the installation, <b>configuration,</b> <b>warnings</b> are displayed, and the resulting information can to know {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of snort Snort, Bro and Suricata as Intrusion Detection System. There are two stages of testing, such as scanning and penetration. Phase scanning is a scan of all ports, scanning is done by using NMAP application which is found on Armitage. Stage penetration is done by using the menu hail mary which is contained in Attack tab, hail mary is used to try all the exploits against computer target. Based on Scanning and penetration process, Snort detects 926 alert, Suricata detects 1218 alerts and Bro detects 128 low alerts. Snort and Suricata ease to install and update rule, Bro requires the least amount of resources. ...|$|R
50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper take-off configuration procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off warning horn of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the take-off <b>configuration</b> <b>warning</b> was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff warning horn) was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|R
40|$|Many {{analytical}} and simulation-based studies of T 6 performance in wireless environments assume an error-free and congestion-free reverse channel {{that has the}} same capacity as the forward channel. Such an assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios, particularly in the hybrid networks consisting of various wireless LAN (WLAN) and cellular technologies. In this paper, we first study, through extensive simulations, the performance characteristics of four representativeTp schemes, namelyTm New Reno, SACK, Veno, and Westwood, under the network conditions of asymmetric end-to-end link capacities, correlated wireless errors, and link congestion in both forward and reverse directions. We then propose a new Tw scheme, calledTl New Jersey, which is capable of distinguishing wireless packet losses from congestion packet losses, and reacting accordingly. Tc New Jersey consists of two key components, the timestamp-based available bandwidth estimation(Ttim algorithm and the congestion <b>warning</b> (CW) router <b>configuration.</b> Tgu is aTJEV# 6) JJ##R 6 T algorithm that continuously estimates the bandwidth available to the connection and guides the sender to adjust its transmission rate when the network becomes congested.

CW is a configuration of network routers such that routers alert end stations by marking all packets {{when there is a}} sign of an incipient congestion. To marking of packets by the CW-configured routers helps the sender of the Te connection to e#ectively di#erentiate packet losses caused by network congestion from those caused by wireless link errors.

40|$|Improving the {{performance}} of the transmission control protocol (TCP) in wireless Internet protocol (IP) communications has been an active research area. The performance degradation of TCP in wireless and wired-wireless hybrid networks is mainly due to its lack of the ability to differentiate the packet losses caused by network congestions from the losses caused by wireless link errors. In this paper, we propose a new TCP scheme, called TCP-Jersey, which is capable of distinguishing the wireless packet losses from the congestion packet losses, and reacting accordingly. TCP-Jersey consists of two key components, the available bandwidth estimation (ABE) algorithm and the congestion <b>warning</b> (CW) router <b>configuration.</b> ABE is a TCP sender side addition that continuously estimates the bandwidth available to the connection and guides the sender to adjust its transmission rate when the network becomes congested. CW is a configuration of network routers such that routers alert end stations by marking all packets when there is a sign of an incipient congestion. The marking of packets by the CW configured routers helps the sender of the TCP connection to effectively differentiate packet losses caused by network congestion from those caused by wireless link errors. This paper describes the design of TCP-Jersey, and presents results from experiments using the NS- 2 network simulator. Results from simulations show that in a congestion free network with 1 % of random wireless packet loss rate, TCP-Jersey achieves 17 % and 85 % improvements in goodput over TCP-Westwood and TCP-Reno, respectively; in a congested network where TCP flow competes with VoIP flows, with 1 % of random wireless packet loss rate, TCP-Jersey achieves 9 % and 76 % improvements in goodput over TCP-Westwood and TCP-Reno, r [...] ...|$|R
