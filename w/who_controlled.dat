5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

Tacitus does not mention <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> {{other areas of the}} province.|$|E
5|$|Many {{planters}} {{refused to}} comply with their provisions. The confrontation continued as the planters challenged on several occasions the right of British government to pass laws binding on the colony, arguing that the Court of Policy has exclusive legislative power within the colony.

5|$|The First Triumvirate (1811–1812), {{influenced}} by Bernardino Rivadavia and Manuel García, instead promoted unrestricted trade with Britain. The Second Triumvirate (1812–1814) and José Gervasio Artigas (<b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the Liga Federal during the 1815–1820 period) sought {{to restore the}} initial protectionist policy, but the Supreme Director restored free trade once more.

5|$|The Sisters of Fate– Featured in God of War II, {{they were}} the three sisters <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the fates of all mortals, gods, and Titans, and lived on the Island of Creation.

5|$|Through {{most of the}} 12th century, France {{was divided}} between the Capetian kings, ruling from the Île-de-France, and kings of England, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> Normandy {{and much of the}} west of France. Within the Capetian territories, early {{experimentation}} in new keep designs began at Houdan in 1120, where a circular keep was built with four round turrets; internally, however, the structure remained conventionally square. A few years later, Château d'Étampes adopted a quatrefoil design. These designs, however, remained isolated experiments.|$|E
5|$|Among the Virginia {{delegation}} to the House was James Madison, Patrick Henry's chief opponent in the Virginia ratification battle. In retaliation for Madison's victory in that battle at Virginia's ratification convention, Henry and other Anti-Federalists, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the Virginia House of Delegates had gerrymandered a hostile district for Madison's planned congressional run and recruited Madison's future presidential successor, James Monroe, to oppose him. Madison defeated Monroe after offering a campaign pledge that he would introduce constitutional amendments comprising a Bill of Rights at the First Congress.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E

5|$|Edward III {{gave the}} castle {{to his own}} son, Edmund of Langley, the Duke of York, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> it until 1402. Edmund's eldest son, Edward, owned it until 1415, when it passed to Maud Clifford, the widow of Edmund's younger son Richard, who lived there until 1446. Richard of York then {{inherited}} the castle, and on his death in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses it passed to his son Edward, who seized the throne in 1461, bringing Conisbrough back into Crown ownership once again.|$|E
5|$|In the Barons' War of 1215–17 {{the castle}} was {{attacked}} again, prompting further improvements in its defences. In 1220 Falkes de Breauté, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> many royal castles {{in the middle}} of England, demolished the Church of St Budoc to the south-east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate. The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone, including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235. King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison, specifically for holding troublesome University clerks, and also improved the castle chapel, replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246. Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford, however, the castle never became a royal residence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 7th century, the West Saxons {{occupied}} {{an area in}} the west of southern England, though the exact boundaries are difficult to define. To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia, {{in what is now}} Devon and Cornwall. To the north were the Mercians, whose king, Wulfhere, had dominated southern England during his reign. In 674 he was succeeded by his brother, Æthelred, who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex, though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made. To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons, in what is now Sussex; and to the east were the East Saxons, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> London.|$|E

5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Porto Ferrajo was a French {{attempt to}} force the {{surrender}} of the Tuscan fortress town of Porto Ferrajo (now Portoferraio) {{on the island of}} Elba following the French occupation of mainland Tuscany in 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British Royal Navy forces <b>who</b> <b>controlled</b> the Mediterranean Sea and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but could not make an impression on the fortress's defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders into submission with the support of a squadron of French Navy frigates operating off the coast.|$|E
