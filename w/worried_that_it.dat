5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma.|$|E
5|$|Michael makes several {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} limelight, culminating with an overlong toast at the wedding banquet in which he impugns Phyllis' chastity. Outraged, Phyllis' husband Bob Vance (Bobby Ray Shafer) throws {{him out of the}} reception hall. Dwight does not let him re-enter, taking satisfaction in being able to eject a real wedding crasher. Michael finds company with Uncle Al, and eventually confesses that he is sorry for his behavior and <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have sullied Phyllis' day.|$|E
5|$|Under , {{the basis}} of {{representation}} of each state in the House of Representatives was determined by adding three-fifths of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment. This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would increase {{the political power of}} the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{ministry}} not only took {{over from the}} former Ministry of Science and Technology, but also assumed responsibility for ICT from the Ministry of Information and Communication and control of Korea Post, some people <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has become bloated. Some others worry about its Korean name, as the Korean name translates directly to English as [...] "Ministry of Future Creation and Science". Some scientists <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> hints at Creationism.|$|R
50|$|Everybody {{is having}} a party. The nursery holds a street party, but Miss Hoolie and Spencer <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> too cold for anyone to come.|$|R
50|$|Opponents of {{the project}} <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is simply too {{expensive}} (some estimates place the cost between $3 billion and $4 billion) and its efficacy is not established.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
50|$|Meghan and Mickey {{decide that}} MTV 3 necessitates new choreography and {{demonstrate}} “What I Like About You”, but Melody <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> {{perhaps a little}} “loose” and she performs a more ladylike version.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people who}} oppose pressure-free {{education}} <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may lower children's scholastic ability, and also create a widening gap in scholastic ability. Some criticism {{is based on}} a misunderstanding of Yutori education.|$|R
50|$|This rule {{offers the}} best variety of playable {{variants}} in all canonical openings, but some players <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gives too great advantage to those players who can prepare sharp complicated 5-move patterns.|$|R
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would work against him.|$|E
25|$|A caboose {{from the}} 1940s stands {{outside of the}} museum. It was donated by Ron and Deanna Kimes. The caboose was {{dedicated}} on Sunday, April 28, of 2013 in conjunction with an event that focused specifically {{on the history of}} Kansas railroad workers. The museum has considered adding a rail car to their outdoor exhibit as well, but are <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be vandalized or damaged.|$|E
25|$|Marie Antoinette was {{instrumental}} in the reinstatement of Jacques Necker as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would go against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances. She accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the Third Estate (tiers état) in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy.|$|E
50|$|The film {{follows a}} couple, Lewis and Suzanne: Lewis {{takes care of}} the house and works part-time, while Suzanne works full-time. Lewis decides he wants a child, but Suzanne <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might {{interfere}} with her career.|$|R
50|$|Shepherd's asylum {{application}} in effect asked Germany {{to define the}} US-led war in Iraq {{as a violation of}} international law, which has led to opposition from some German politicians to the application, over <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could harm US-German relations.|$|R
5000|$|Bowie {{was excited}} {{to work on the}} film but was {{concerned}} about the final product. He said [...] "I must say, there's nothing <b>that</b> looks like <b>it</b> on the market. But I'm a bit <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> just perversely bloody at some points." ...|$|R
25|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the long-term viability of the new industry and <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be called on to bail out struggling stations and networks if the economy deteriorated. Consequently, it decided to grant the initial commercial TV licences to established print media proprietors, with the expectation that these companies would, if necessary, be able to subsidize the new TV stations from their existing (and highly profitable) press operations.|$|E
25|$|Nimoy was not {{the only}} person {{concerned}} with Spock's ears. NBC executives were <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> made him appear satanic, and were concerned that viewers would not wish to associate with an alien character. At the time, Roddenberry felt that the satanic issue might prove positive as he believed that female viewers would find a slightly dangerous and taboo character more attractive. This was supported by female visitors to the set who seemed to be immediately drawn to Nimoy.|$|E
25|$|Broad was {{responsible}} for implementing a controversial $70 million proposal to encourage welfare groups and councils to form not-for-profit housing associations {{as a means of}} dealing with public housing. Though Broad had not been involved in the plan's conception, as it had been devised by her predecessor as Minister for Housing, she {{had to deal with the}} mixed reactions the proposal received. While it was commended by some, such as the Salvation Army, others, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gave them little protection if an association ran into financial trouble.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2017, declassified {{documents}} {{revealed that}} the 1955 decision to claim the island as UK territory was motivated by <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could otherwise be used by [...] "hostile agents" [...] to spy on the future South Uist missile testing range.|$|R
30|$|Social media {{compliments}} marketing efforts; for example, Twitter {{is great}} for ‘trial and error’ in the social media world. Whatever you put up there only lasts about 15 min, so you can test things out without <b>worrying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will remain in cyberspace to haunt you.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the country}} is so remote and out of reach, the people are poor and {{among some of the}} most {{disadvantaged}} people in any island in the world. Tourism can provide some source of income, however, there is a <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might bring damage to the environment.|$|R
25|$|Under {{this job}} contract, which aimed to {{encourage}} {{the creation of new}} jobs, it would have been easier, during a contract's first two years, for workers under twenty-six years old to be fired. It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could compromise job security, encourage social pressure with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired.|$|E
25|$|The UFW {{considered}} more mass picketing, more rallies, and more boycotts, but the union was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{had lost the}} support of farm workers and the public and that such events would point out {{the weakness of the}} union rather than its strength. Instead, the UFW settled on a 110-mile (180km) march by a small group of UFW leaders from San Francisco to the E & J Gallo Winery in Modesto. The organizers envisioned a small but dramatic march that would not require large numbers of participants. Just a few hundred marchers left San Francisco on February 22, 1975. But more than 15,000 people joined them en route {{by the time they reached}} Modesto on March 1.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy {{requested}} {{an eternal}} flame for her husband's grave. According to several published accounts, she {{drew inspiration from}} a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which {{she and her husband had}} seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel The Candle in the Wind (the fourth book from the collection The Once and Future King by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical Camelot (the cast recording was a favorite of the Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery. But Mrs. Kennedy was adamant.|$|E
50|$|Lyricist Anthony Newley {{has said}} in {{interviews}} that upon hearing Woods' rendition for the first time, he was appalled {{at the lack of}} commerciality in the performance — <b>worrying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would possibly be depriving the duo of not only a hit record but an Oscar nomination as well.|$|R
5000|$|CMS may build a {{new high}} school near The Palisades in coming years. Former {{principal}} Pamela Espinosa and others <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could lead to a}} [...] "have and have-not school". They say that they are otherwise hopeful that innovation and pride will lead the school into an exciting future.|$|R
50|$|The {{sale of the}} lot {{owned by}} the library has been controversial, with <b>worries</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will result in {{decreased}} space for the public facilities, despite {{the use of the}} building's first floor for a new library. The sale has been presented as a means of helping the library system in Brooklyn meet its capital needs.|$|R
25|$|During the Peace Congress of Berlin, Carp was {{especially}} {{alarmed by the}} territorial exchanges: Romania lost the Budjak region to Russia and, in addition to international recognition, received Northern Dobruja (formerly in the Ottoman Danube Vilayet). Domnitor Carol and the Brătianu government reluctantly approved this deal, but a parliamentary faction, comprising Carp and PNL's Dimitrie Sturdza, explicitly condemned it. Their resolution stipulated that annexing Northern Dobruja was against the national interest; the opposition saw Northern Dobruja as a marshy, toxic, territory, and <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was largely inhabited by Muslims or disgruntled Bulgarians. Carp personally worried that the region was indefensible in front of Bulgarian irredentism. Eventually, on September 28, 1878, after a lengthy debate in Parliament and a convincing speech by Foreign Minister Kogălniceanu, the vote swung and the territorial exchange was given official endorsement. The government insisted that the incorporation was not a pittance or spoils of war, but the recovery of ancient Wallachian territory.|$|E

25|$|Tension {{between members}} of the band continued, however. Along with musical differences, drug use became a problem, and Santana was deeply <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{affecting}} the band's performance. Coke Escovedo encouraged Santana to take more control of the band's musical direction, much {{to the dismay of}} some of the others who thought that the band and its sound was a collective effort. Also, financial irregularities were exposed while under the management of Stan Marcum, whom Bill Graham criticized as being incompetent. Growing resentments between Santana and Michael Carabello over lifestyle issues resulted in his departure on bad terms. James Mingo Lewis was hired at the last minute as a replacement at a concert in New York City. David Brown later left due to substance abuse problems. A South American tour was cut short in Lima, Peru, due to unruly fans and to student protests against U.S. governmental policies. The madness of the tour convinced Santana that changes needed {{to be made in the}} band and in his life.|$|E
5000|$|On 18 April, Swedish Integration Minister Nyamko Sabuni {{announced}} that her government would boycott the conference, sending no ministerial officials to the event, due to <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be a}} repeat of the last conference on racism. She said that a ministerial presence would [...] "legitimize undemocratic forces." [...] However, a low-level delegation was sent instead.|$|R
5000|$|Nuclear weapons expert David Albright {{author of}} 'Peddling Peril' has also {{expressed}} concerns that Pakistan's stockpile {{may not be}} secure despite assurances by both Pakistan and U.S. government.

But <b>it</b> is <b>worrying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is willing to further limit {{the scope of}} the Charter when it might be needed the most...|$|R
