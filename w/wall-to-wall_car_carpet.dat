40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{bachelor}} thesis is design of a manufacturing technology for <b>car</b> <b>carpet</b> made from a thermoplastic elastomer. <b>Car</b> <b>carpet</b> will be produced by injection molding with a hot runner system {{in a series of}} 42 000 units per year. At first there is an analysis of the current technologies, enclosed with a summary of reasons for the changes in manufacturing technology. Then following is a general review of the literature relating to plastic materials and injection molding technology. In the practical part a suitable material is chosen, injection molding machine is chosen according to calculated technological parameters and a conceptual design of an injection mold for <b>car</b> <b>carpet</b> is executed. The last part is a technical and economical evaluation comparing the current production technology with the newly proposed technology...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a primary}} school (since 1717), {{community}} centre, library, health care centre, pharmacy, kindergarten and three grocery stores in Raasiku. Also some industrial manufacturers operate there: AS Mistra produces <b>car</b> <b>carpets</b> and wall finishing materials; AS Raasiku Elekter makes electrical equipment and metal products.|$|R

50|$|Originally all the <b>cars</b> had <b>carpeted</b> flooring. Due {{to similar}} {{concerns}} regarding cleanliness, the carpeting {{in all of}} the cars has been removed. The A and B, and C2 cars now feature vinyl flooring in either grey or blue coloring, while the C1 cars feature a spray-on composite flooring.|$|R
2500|$|The Overlander's reprieve saw {{an interim}} {{refurbishment}} programme implemented, both internally and externally. Externally, the three former Bay Express cars and seven existing Overlander cars retained the Cato blue paint scheme of the Tranz Rail era, {{but with the}} new [...] "Overlander" [...] promotional logo introduced by Toll Rail on the sides in large white letters. Also, structural repair work was carried out. Internally, the cars were tidied up and seats replaced or reupholstered in some <b>cars,</b> new <b>carpet</b> laid in others.|$|R
5000|$|The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1971. It was {{the first}} carpet {{retailer}} to open very large stores on busy main roads, often after re developing former <b>car</b> showrooms. Previously <b>carpet</b> stores were small and only had sample books to show.|$|R
50|$|While never {{intended}} for such purposes, the Mini-T {{is a common}} <b>car</b> at indoor <b>carpet</b> races and holds its own well against newer trucks. Another popular use of the Mini-T is conversion to a mini dirt oval racer. Team Losi also offers the Micro T, a 1/36 scale stadium truck.|$|R
30|$|As already {{discussed}} for PCBs and PFCs, the observed differences between locations and species are probably related {{to differences in}} local contamination {{as well as to}} different feeding habits, metabolism, and ecology. PBDEs are emitted not only by industrial plants, but also by households, e.g., from electronic equipment, <b>cars,</b> furniture, <b>carpets,</b> etc., which means that the surroundings of areas with high population densities {{are likely to be more}} contaminated compared to more remote sites [65, 67, 94]. On the other hand, species-specific properties like feeding habits and metabolism also influence the contaminant levels in bird eggs [64, 67, 75] and thus contribute to the reported differences.|$|R
5000|$|Naturally, {{emphasis}} was on automobile facilities, but passengers were far from neglected. Though her lounge space was limited compared to the spacious equivalent quarters on the larger ships in the CP fleet, the Motor Princess was nonetheless well appointed. On {{both sides of the}} upper <b>car</b> deck, <b>carpeted</b> lounges were provided with large windows for viewing the scenic Gulf Islands. In addition, the after two-fifths of the upper deck were devoted to a combination dining room and social hall with hardwood flooring. Two staterooms were also provided on the compact ship, and ample open deck space was available for leisurely strolls and relaxing in the sun during the summer months. (129) ...|$|R
50|$|Instruments were {{confined}} to a single large speedometer with fuel gauge in the saloon (a temperature gauge was available as an option) on a dashboard of grey pressed fibreboard. The coupé dashboard was equipped with speedometer, fuel and temperature gauges, together with a lockable glovebox. The <b>car</b> had loop-pile <b>carpeting</b> and heater as standard. A number of extras were available including twin SU carburettors, leather seats, a wood-veneered dashboard, Telaflo shock absorbers and paint options.|$|R
25|$|Pullman {{established}} his company in 1862 and built luxury sleeping <b>cars</b> which featured <b>carpeting,</b> draperies, upholstered chairs, libraries and card tables and an unparalleled level of customer service. Once {{a household name}} due to their large market share, the Pullman Company is also known for the bitter Pullman Strike staged by their workers and union leaders in 1894. During an economic downturn, Pullman reduced hours and wages but not rents, precipitating the strike. Workers joined the American Railway Union, led by Eugene V. Debs.|$|R
50|$|Glade (/gleɪd/) is an S. C. Johnson & Son {{brand of}} {{household}} air fresheners that were first introduced in 1956. The {{family of products}} include: Aerosol Sprays, Candles, <b>Car</b> Scented Oil, <b>Carpet</b> & Room, Glass Scents, PlugIns, PlugIns Scented Gel, PlugIns Scented Oil, Press'n Fresh, Secrets, Scented Oil Candles, and Wisp. Glade is a worldwide brand, known variously {{around the world as}} Glade, Gleid, Brise (Germany, France, and the Netherlands), etc. Brise was renamed in Glade in Germany, France, and the Netherlands in 2012.|$|R

25|$|During the sixth-season finale, {{a seventh}} {{season of the}} show was confirmed. Auditions were held {{throughout}} November and December 2006, taking place in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, and Darwin. The house this season was confirmed as to be having an 'eco-friendly' theme and style; It featured a pedal-powered washing machine, a rubber garden turf made from recycled <b>car</b> tyres and <b>carpets</b> made from goat hair. On 18 April 2007, after housemates were put into lockdown, {{it was revealed that}} there would be no prize money this season. The launch date of the seventh season was rumoured to be 22 April 2007. These rumours were later confirmed.|$|R
40|$|In recent {{incidents}} {{reported to}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), fires spontaneously ignited when workers or others attempted to fill portable gasoline containers (gas cans) in the backs of pickup trucks equipped with plastic bed liners or in <b>cars</b> with <b>carpeted</b> surfaces. Serious skin burns and other injuries resulted. Similar incidents {{in the last few}} years have resulted in warning bulletins from several private and government organizations. These fires result from the buildup of static electricity. The insulating effect of the bed liner or carpet prevents the static charge generated by gasoline flowing into the container or other sources from grounding. The discharge of this buildup to the grounded gasoline dispenser nozzle may cause a spark and ignite the gasoline. Both ungrounded metal (most hazardous) and plastic gas containers have been involved in these incidents. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 1998. "Caption title.

500|$|In 1986, former Curtiss-Wright and Martin Marietta {{employees}} testified about {{hazards and}} waste disposal practices before a {{hearing of the}} Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A former employee told how a night watchman walked through a spill in the reactor complex without knowing it; the man's <b>car</b> and the <b>carpets</b> in his house had to be destroyed {{as a result of}} the contamination. Others told about burying hundreds of drums of unknown waste from the reactor facility and digging a trench [...] and [...] deep for waste drums north of Wykoff Run Road. The locations of some sites, which included radioactive waste, beryllium oxide, and other toxic compounds, were not recorded. A forest ranger testified that he had dismantled a CCC-built drinking water fountain fed by a spring because it was downhill from the reactor and he feared people might drink contaminated water from it.|$|R
50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} the carpets used in the interiors of <b>cars.</b> The molded <b>carpet</b> is designed to hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting carpet. The process of creating the molded carpet requires the original floor pans and having the carpet laid upon the pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, easier to bend and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the floor pans. This helps prevent the carpet from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact the carpet. The jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{of these}} four cars was unique in their own way. Two were {{outwardly}} like the Dreadnoughts. Tram 100 was built in 1903 as the Tramway Company Manager's personal [...] "Palace" [...] <b>car,</b> fitted with <b>carpets,</b> plush seat covers and further interior decorations. Converted to regular passenger use in 1918 and was withdrawn from service in 1958. Tram 110 was built in 1906 as the prototype for the Dreadnoughts, but it had different trucks, which resulted in high steps. It was withdrawn from service in 1952. Tram 101 was built in 1899 originally with no solid roof, just a canvas awning suspended from a lightweight frame. It was withdrawn from service around 1935. Tram 104 was converted in 1943 from a Brill 12 bench car that had been badly damaged in an accident. In its converted form this tram had design features derived from the Four Motor, Dropcentre and Baby Dreadnought tram designs. It was withdrawn from service in 1958.|$|R
40|$|The {{author is}} {{interested}} in the phenomena of kitsch that can be found in various dimensions of modern life. The question that can be asked nowadays is: ’Is there any segment of modern life without kitsch’? We could say that there is not only a phenomenon of the kitsch-subject but also of the kitsch-object that entered modern society. Kitsch-subject is often defined as a person who sees the value as in a kitschy way. That person usually thinks that a work of art is of the same value as an expensive <b>car</b> or Persian <b>carpet</b> and buys these objects in order to gain in reputation. So he(she) usually decides to decorate his house and office with a lot of expensive paintings, books and furniture. In that way the kitsch-subject becomes a kitsch-object because he becomes a victim and a ’slave’ of all these objects. It is well-known that even the greatest authors sometimes create for the masses of people and add to the works some segments in order to make people buy the objects they made. So, the author is trying to point out that kitsch is a very common phenomenon that can be displayed in many different ways...|$|R
5000|$|For 1973, 300 changes {{included}} new {{exterior and}} interior colors and new standard interior trim. Front and rear nameplate scripts [...] "Chevrolet Vega 2300" [...] were changed to [...] "Vega by Chevrolet". To meet the 1973 5 mph front bumper standards the front bumper, on stronger brackets, was extended 3 in, with a steel body-color filler panel. US-built Saginaw manual transmissions and a new shift linkage replaced the Opel units. The RPO L11 engine had a new Holley 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. New options included BR70-13 white-stripe steel-belted radial tires, full wheel covers, and body side molding with black rubber insert. Two new models were introduced mid-year: the estate wagon with DI-NOC wood grain sides and rear trim, and the LX notchback with vinyl roof finish. On May 17, 1973, the millionth Vega left the Lordstown Assembly plant - an orange GT hatchback with white sport stripes, power steering and neutral custom vinyl interior including exclusive vinyl door panels. A limited-edition [...] "Millionth Vega" [...] was introduced replicating the milestone <b>car,</b> with orange <b>carpeting</b> and Millionth Vega door handle accents. Sixty-five hundred were built from May 1 to July 1.|$|R
