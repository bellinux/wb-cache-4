2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{a splendid}} estate of 650 acres, {{lying on the}} Potomac, between Alexandria and Washington. I doubt whether in the whole Southland there had existed a finer country seat; the house was built solidly, as if to defy time itself, with its {{beautiful}} trees, fine orchards, its terraced lawns, graveled walks leading to the river {{a quarter of a}} mile away; the splendid barns, the stables with fine horses (for which my father, a retired naval officer, had a special fondness), the servants quarters, where dwelt the old family retainers and their offspring, some fifty or more. ... The land was there after the war, but that was all.|$|E
2500|$|In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush {{developed}} {{to sign the}} players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. [...] Sam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis players. [...] Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. [...] The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) {{and the rest of the}} team's starting lineup. [...] The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. [...] The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. [...] The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. [...] As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them [...] "out at sea" [...] for 10 days. [...] In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: [...] "We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature comforts you could find packed away on ice. [...] <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to our contracts." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nevertheless, <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{there in}} a {{meaningless}} sort of way--I hardly knew why. To {{me it was a}} puzzle.

60|$|The morrow came, {{and with}} it a deadlier fray than any that had gone before, and after it more morrows and more deaths, but still <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on,</b> for Guatemoc gave us of his food. Then Cortes sent his heralds {{demanding}} our surrender, and now three-fourths {{of the city was}} a ruin, and three-fourths of its defenders were dead. The dead were heaped in the houses like bees stifled in a hive, and in the streets they lay so thick that we walked upon them.|$|E
60|$|And {{then there}} were our sweet stolen moments {{in the midst of}} our work--just a word, or caress, or flash of love-light; and our moments were sweeter for being stolen. For <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the heights, where the air was keen and sparkling, where the toil was for humanity, and where sordidness and {{selfishness}} never entered. We loved love, and our love was never smirched by anything less than the best. And this out of all remains: I did not fail. I gave him rest--he who worked so hard for others, my dear, tired-eyed mortalist.|$|E

60|$|For a week <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> {{the mesa}} at Walpi {{in the house}} of Heli. Aided by Dr. Fewkes of Washington, we saw most of the phases of the snake ceremonies. The doctor and his own men were camped {{at the foot of the}} mesa, making a special study of the Hopi and their history. Remote, {{incredibly}} remote it all seemed even at that time, and some of that charm I put into an account of it which Harper's published--one of the earliest popular accounts of the Snake Dance.|$|E

Still, we got a deer now and then, {{and we had a}} very little flour. It was mouldy when we bought it, but we hadn't dollars enough for {{anything}} better. Mrs. Jimmy got sick and thin, but she never grumbled, and was always waiting bright and smiling when we crawled back into the shanty. Anyway, we found no silver that would pay for the getting, though we knew it was there." ...|$|E
60|$|To be sure, he didn't seem to {{have any}} {{relations}} except us. This used to puzzle Claude and me. Everybody on the mainland had relations; why hadn't we? Was it because <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> an island? We thought it would be so jolly to have an uncle and aunt and some cousins. Once we asked Father about it, but he looked so sorrowful all of a sudden that we wished we hadn't. He said it was all his fault. I didn't see how that could be, but I never said anything more about it to Father. Still, I did wish we had some relations.|$|E

60|$|I {{believe in}} the forest, and in the meadow, and in the night in which the corn grows. We require an {{infusion}} of hemlock, spruce or arbor vitae in our tea. There {{is a difference between}} eating and drinking for strength and from mere gluttony. The Hottentots eagerly devour the marrow of the koodoo and other antelopes raw, as a matter of course. Some of our northern Indians eat raw the marrow of the Arctic reindeer, as well as various other parts, including the summits of the antlers, {{as long as they are}} soft. And herein, perchance, they have stolen a march on the cooks of Paris. They get what usually goes to feed the fire. This is probably better than stall-fed beef and slaughterhouse pork to make a man of. Give me a wildness whose glance no civilization can endure--as if <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on</b> the marrow of koodoos devoured raw.|$|E
60|$|He kept me {{with him}} all the time, and I {{never got a chance}} to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>on.</b> Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.|$|E

[...] "When you an' me mushed into the Yukon in the good ole days, it didn't rain soup and they wa'n't no free-lunch joints.
