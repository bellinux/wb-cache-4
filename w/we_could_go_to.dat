500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason}} that when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|Relief {{came and}} it was {{possible}} that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> homeback <b>to</b> the old TransvaalMy love will probably also be thereto reward me with a kiss ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Putnam Hall," [...] added Randy. [...] "From what dad {{has told}} me, {{it must have}} been one dandy school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, {{while the}} others were taking the trip through Yellowstone Park <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> out <b>to</b> that mining {{district}} and try to locate this missing mine," [...] went on Dave, with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Burton," [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "I think it's coming on! I'm glad we {{are going}} to the Milan. I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a music-hall to-night. That woman was attractive!" ...|$|E
60|$|I wish I were in Switzerland, and I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Florence; {{but we have}} {{to leave}} these delights to you; there is no helping it. We all join in love to you and all the family.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. At {{the same}} time I ought not to speak so, for they have been very kind. I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Rouen afterwards; aunt repeats her {{invitation}} as usual. However, there is time enough to think of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{even more}} Kovantchina," [...] said Aaron. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> melody pure and simple. Yet I find Kovantchina, {{which is all}} mass music practically, gives me more {{satisfaction}} than any other opera." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} about this case that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the Army to say you need to re-look at it," [...] she said. [...] "We didn't have {{anything}} new. We didn't have anything that suggested wrongdoing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{nervous system}} is quite shaken," [...] said the duchess. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Brentham. I {{mentioned}} it to Corisande this morning, and I {{was surprised to find}} that she wished to remain in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, then," [...] I said, [...] "why {{do you not}} let me go {{with you}} {{to the police and}} have some {{inquiries}} made? If you prefer it, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a private detective. I really think that something ought to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We ha'n't {{bound to}} stay in Florence," [...] said Mrs. Lander, thoughtfully. [...] "I only took the rooms by the week, and we can go, any time, Clementina, if you are uncomf'table bein' here on Miss Milray's account. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Rome; they say Rome's a nice place; or to Egypt." ...|$|E
6000|$|WE didn't {{get done}} {{tinkering}} the machinery till away {{late in the}} afternoon, {{and so it was}} so close to sundown when we got home that we never stopped on our road, but made a break for the sycamores as tight as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> <b>to</b> tell Jake what the delay was, and have him wait till <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Brace's and find out how things was there. It was getting pretty dim by the time we turned the corner of the woods, sweating and panting with that long run, and see the sycamores thirty yards ahead of us; and just then we see a couple of men run into the bunch and heard two or three terrible screams for help. [...] "Poor Jake is killed, sure," [...] we says. We was scared through and through, and broke for the tobacker field and hid there, trembling so our clothes would hardly stay on; and just as we skipped in there, a couple of men went tearing by, and into the bunch they went, and in a second out jumps four men and took out up the road as tight as they could go, two chasing two.|$|E
6000|$|Then Bessie got up {{and showed}} her a pale, serious face. She bent this face upon her sister for some time, confessing silently and a little pleading. [...] "I told him," [...] she said at last, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Branches." ...|$|R
5000|$|Benfeito is {{considered}} a lifelong friend of Filion. She says that [...] "We've known one another for our entire lives, {{so we have a}} really good relationship. It's more of a sisterhood relationship now. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> probably <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a restaurant and order for each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Frisco Kid, {{with his}} back against the tiller and holding the sloop off that it might cover their {{previous}} course, looked at him with an expression of disgust, and muttered: [...] "The dog! <b>We</b> <b>could</b> well <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bottom, for all he 'd care or do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{told him}} ten so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church {{afterwards}} if we wished to. Of course, Ida, I am {{still in the}} dark as to what you have made up your mind to do, but whatever it is I {{thought that he had}} better once and for all hear your final decision from your own lips. If, however, you feel yourself at liberty to tell it to me as your father, I shall be glad to hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but there}} is a very great doubt of it, ma'am; and you will say so too when you know what your severe {{son-in-law}} threatens to do." [...] He turned to Mrs. Linley. [...] "After having seen that pretty little friend of mine who has just gone to bed (how much nicer it would be for all of us if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed too!), I think I know how you answered your husband's letter. But I ought perhaps to see how you have expressed yourself. Have you got a copy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He said yes, he {{knew that}} Mrs. Vervain was not strong, and Florida continued: [...] "It's only advice that I want for her, but I think we had better see some one--or know some one that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> in need. We are so far from any one we know, or help of any kind." [...] She {{seemed to be trying}} to account to herself, rather than to Ferris, for what she was doing. [...] "We mustn't let {{anything}} pass unnoticed".... She looked at him entreatingly, but a shadow, as of some wounding memory, passed over her face, and she said no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jo {{talks about}} the country where we hope to live sometime--the real country, she means, with pigs and {{chickens}} and haymaking. It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>go</b> <b>to</b> it," [...] said Beth musingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would not}} be easy; for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him and say, `Leif, when you see these particular marks on a certain stone, you are {{to understand that we}} take leave of you for ever with hearty good-will!' I fear that his suspicions might be aroused thereby." ...|$|R
60|$|I had not {{supposed}} {{that the people}} of Benedict would know very much concerning what was going on {{at the lower end of}} the bay; but the Avenger was hardly more than at anchor when I understood that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> no better place in order to learn what was being done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's see. New York doesn't want us. But somewhere {{there must}} be a village of folks that does. We'll start out right now, walking through New York, and we'll hunt till we find it, even if we have to go clean out to San Francisco. Gee! think, we're free, no job or nothing, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco! Travel, like we've always wanted to! And we won't have any more pride now to bother us, not after--that. I'll play the mouth-organ for pennies! Come on, we'll start for Japan, and see the cherry-blossoms. Come on, old partner, we're going to pioneer, like our daddies that went West." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course we}} would not have time to stay here longer, even if Jone hadn't got the rheumatism; but if he had to have it, for which I am as sorry as anybody can be, it is a lucky thing that he did have it just about the time {{that we ought to be}} going away, anyhow. And {{although}} I did not think, when we came to England, that we should ever go to Buxton, we are thankful that there is such a place to go to; although, for my part, I can't help feeling disappointed that the season isn't such that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Bath, and Evelina and Beau Brummel.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man named}} Stephen Heneage {{has taken up}} this Barnes affair," [...] he answered. [...] "He saw you leave the flats that night, and he is likely, if he thinks that it might lead to anything, to give the whole show away. He warned me {{to get away from}} England and--but you want the truth, don't you? All these are excuses! I came because I wanted you!--because I couldn't live without you, Louise! Couldn't we steal away somewhere and never go back? Why need we? <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Paris to-morrow, catch the Orient express the next day--I know a dozen hiding-places where we should be safe enough. We will make our own world and our own life--and forget!" ...|$|E
60|$|This sign hung triumphantly {{for several}} days, when one morning, {{just as we}} had {{finished}} breakfast, we were surprised to hear the stage stop at the door, and before <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> out <b>to</b> see who had arrived, into the room came our own stage-driver, {{as we used to}} call him. He had actually left his team to come and see us.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{shall never}} have any! But {{it might come}} without. Why, Lucy, a few years in that country, and I shall {{be able to give}} him the best of educations and release you from drudgery; and when independent, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the Holt on terms to suit even your proud stomach, and might make the dear old thing happy in her old age.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{beg your}} pardon, Jerry Muskrat. I didn't {{mean to say}} just that," [...] replied Spotty. [...] "You see, we are all worried. We thought last night that by this morning the Laughing Brook would be full of water again, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the Smiling Pool {{as soon as we}} felt like it, and here it is as bad as ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that," [...] the Prime Minister assented. [...] "That is why I am coming down myself and {{bringing}} Bransome. If {{he will have}} nothing to say to us within a week or so of his departure, we shall know what to think. Remember my words, Devenham,--when our chronicler dips his pen into the ink and writes of our government, our foreign policy, at least, will be judged by our position in the far East. Exactly what that will be depends upon Prince Maiyo. With a renewal of our treaty <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the country tomorrow. Without it, especially if the refusal should come from them, there will be some very ugly writing across the page." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean this}} way: <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Crumville {{and you could}} watch your chance, and when the coast was clear you could git a rig and drive over to the Basswood house and go in quite excited like and tell 'em that this Mr. Wadsworth was a-want-in' to see them miniatures right away,--that a very celebrated art critic had called on him, but couldn't stay long. Wanted to ketch a train and all that. You could tell 'em that Mr. Wadsworth had sent you to git the miniatures, {{and that he had}} said that he would return 'em jest as soon as the critic had looked 'em over. Do you ketch the idee?" [...] and Tim Crapsey looked {{narrowly}} at his companion.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were glad}} to have this woman, for we were short handed. We were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making. If we stayed where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our defenses, we should no longer be invincible. We had conquered; in turn we were conquered. The Boss {{recognized}} this; we all recognized it. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I {{was among the first}} that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands. Others were taken down, and still others. To-morrow-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Benfeito and Filion {{have been}} {{together}} as diving partners {{for a long time}} and reportedly consider each other as lifelong friends. Filion said of their relationship that, [...] "We've known one another for our entire lives, so we have a really good relationship. It's more of a sisterhood relationship now. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> probably <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a restaurant and order for each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to American officials, {{relations}} between the coalition and Jamaluddin Badar broke down over allegations of corruption and months of unpaid police salaries. [...] "We withdraw investment in places we cannot go," [...] said US Navy Commander Russell McCormack. [...] "In one month, we canceled 3.5 million dollars in schools because <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the sites to verify {{what was happening to}} the money." ...|$|R
60|$|THE MAIDEN. Yes: that is true: I used to. We used {{to think}} {{it would be nice to}} sleep in one another's arms; but <b>we</b> never <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep because our weight stopped our circulations just above the elbows. Then somehow my feeling began to change bit by bit. I kept a sort of {{interest}} in your head and arms long after I lost interest in your whole body. And now that has gone.|$|R
