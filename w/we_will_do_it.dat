[...] "There {{is no place for}} Communist symbols and ideology in European Ukraine and if the authorities cannot get rid of them, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> ourselves", said Miroshnychenko. According to police, Miroshnychenko climbed the statue and put a rope around Lenin’s figure, which was then pulled down by a truck.|$|E

The Golan Brewery, founded in late 2006 by Naftali Pinchevsky and Haim Ohayon, was established with a mind to reviving the region's ancient tradition. Years earlier Pinchevsky was importing homebrewing kits to Israel, but he was {{ahead of his time}} and the idea did not catch on. He later established Murphy's bars in Herzliya and Modi'in. Ohayon, a land developer who co-founded nearby Kanaf and who has also invested in the Hapoel Gilboa Galil basketball club and in a local genetics startup, says he is driven by a determination to demonstrate that [...] "even though we are far {{from the center of the}} country, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> best." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October the {{communist}} party began attempting to reassert its power in the eastern cities. During the strike, the city committees and city soviets of the eastern cities had allowed the OSTK to deeply insinuate itself into city government structures; after the strike, city communist leaders tried {{to take the initiative}} back into their own hands. For example, cooperation with the OSTK in the city soviets led deputies in Tiraspol, Bendery, and Rȋbniţa to suspend the introduction of the language laws and deputies in Tiraspol and Rȋbniţa to agree to a referendum on the creation of a Transnistrian autonomous republic. Once the strike was over, however, communist leaders attempted rollback these concessions. The republican communist party leaders in Chişinău were especially keen to see this happen and put pressure on local communists to repeal [...] "illegal" [...] decisions taken during the strike. In a meeting in October, Associate Chair of the Presidium of the Moldovan Supreme Soviet, Victor Puşcaş, in the presence of Communist Party First Secretary, Semion Grossu, berated local communists for losing control of the situation in Transnistria. It would look better for the city soviets to repeal all illegal decisions by themselves, he concluded. [...] "However," [...] he warned, [...] "if you cannot get them to repeal these resolutions, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for them." [...] Back home, the first secretaries of the eastern cities convened plenums of the city committees and sessions of the city soviets. Some OSTK members were allowed to attend and participate, but Semion Grossu attended in order {{to keep an eye on}} the proceedings and make sure the sessions went as planned. The local communist party meetings called on the city soviets to bring local law into accordance with republican law and decisions adopted by the local soviets supported acceptance of the language laws in Transnistria. Communist-run state media also criticized the OSTK and local communists attempted to shut down OSTK newspapers, a measure that prevented the organization from putting out its publication for much of late 1989.|$|E
