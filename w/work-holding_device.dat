5000|$|The machine used {{is called}} a {{squaring}} shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or [...] "rocked" [...] in order to shear the material progressively {{from one side to}} the other; this angle is referred to as the shear angle. Setting the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5 degree shear angle decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5Â°, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the blades. However, raking the blade compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, <b>work-holding</b> <b>device,</b> upper and lower blades, and a gauging device. The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The <b>work-holding</b> <b>device</b> is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the gauging device is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be.|$|E

50|$|A fixture is a <b>work-holding</b> {{or support}} <b>device</b> {{used in the}} {{manufacturing}} industry. Fixtures are used to securely locate (position in a specific location or orientation) and support the work, ensuring that all parts produced using the fixture will maintain conformity and interchangeability. Using a fixture improves the economy of production by allowing smooth operation and quick transition from part to part, reducing the requirement for skilled labor by simplifying how workpieces are mounted, and increasing conformity across a production run.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn modern automated manufacturing systems, {{there is a need}} for <b>work-holding</b> <b>devices</b> that provide for precision, accuracy, reliability, flexibility and remoteness of control. One of such devices is the diaphragm chuck which utilizes the strain energy of its varying thickness diaphragm plate for gripping action. The jaw-carrying diaphragm plate is deflected by a thrust load, and the jaws are bored or ground to the nominal diameter of the workpiece. Gripping action occurs when the workpiece is inserted into the jaws and the thrust is relieved. Designers and manufacturers of diaphragm chucks have in the past been limited to the use of empirical data for diaphragm chuck design. This design limitation has been caused by complex problems due to factors such as the varying thickness encastre diaphragm plate, the gripping couples and the stiffening effects of the jaw slides. This work involved the establishment, by theory and experimental verification, of the design and performance parameters of a diaphragm chuck, and the provision of diaphragm chuck design methodology. The designer is therefore able to achieve the a priori design of the diaphragm chuck. In addition, the user is able to adapt existing diaphragm plates to achieve required gripping forces within existing constraints. The scope of this research is the static gripping action for any number of symmetric jaws. The design method is for diaphragm plates with small thickness taper, and carry detachable jaw slides. The concept of the equivalent constant thickness is applied to the diaphragm plate. Gripping action is divided into two major phases - the separate deflections of the diaphragm plate by a thrust load and symmetric couples. These deflections are equated to obtain the gripping force. This research concludes that the gripping force of a diaphragm chuck is closely predicted by the equivalent constant thickness method. Design data and methodology are provided for diaphragm chuck design. Thus, a designer can now design a diaphragm chuck based on a desired and pre-specified gripping force requirement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fixture is a <b>work-holding</b> or {{supporting}} <b>device</b> used in {{the manufacturing}} industry to hold the workpiece. Fixtures are used to securely locate (position in a specific location or orientation) and support the work, ensuring that all parts produced using the fixture will maintain conformity and interchangeability. The location of fixture elements is called as fixture layout. The fixture layout plays {{major role in the}} work piece deformation during the machining operation. Hence optimization of fixture layout to minimize the work piece deformation is one of the critical aspects in the fixture design process. Minimization the workpiece deformation which is the objective function in the present work is calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) and the fixture layout is optimized using Discrete fixture layout optimization method (DFLOM), Continuous fixture layout optimization method (CFLOM) and Integrated fixture layout optimization method (IFLOM). The workpiece deformation is minimum in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based IFLOM is reported for the selected fixture. In this paper the PSO is used as an optimization tool to optimize the workpiece deformation...|$|R
