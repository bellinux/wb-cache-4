40|$|Research {{detailed}} {{in this thesis}} investigated the generation of Nitric Oxide (NO) {{and its role in}} the pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Two putative nitric oxide synthase genes and single copy nitrate and nitrite reductase genes were cloned as potential sources of NO in M. oryzae. Single and double gene disrupted mutants were generated and their phenotypes assessed. Detection of NO is problematic. Herein, a fluorescent plate reader assay was developed, exploiting the NO sensitive dye DAR- 4 M AM and the NO scavenger PTIO, to compare wildtype NO generation with the mutant strains. All strains were assessed for infection-related development on an artificial surface inductive to appressorium formation and maturation in the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> Appressorium formation in the presence of PTIO and the NO donor DETANONOate was recorded for all strains on this surface. The pathogenicity of the wildtype and mutant strains were assessed, in terms of their ability to infect rice and barley plants. Finally, the capacity of each strain to metabolise nitrogen was evaluated to confirm the disruption of the nitrate and nitrite reductase genes. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the plate reader assay provides robust evidence for the generation of NO in M. oryzae. However, none of the various mutant strains showed a reduction in NO emission during germling morphogenesis. However, they exhibited significantly different infection-related development on an inductive artificial surface as compared with the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> Moreover, exogenous application of PTIO to the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> provided evidence for NO and its involvement in germination and appressorium development. No significant differences in the infection of rice and barley leaves were observed between the wildtype and mutant strains, indicating their disrupted genes are dispensable for pathogenesis. The nitrate and nitrite reductase genes were found to be essential for nitrate assimilation. In summary, this work provides the most robust evidence for the generation of NO in fungi to-date, but the molecular mechanism underpinning the generation of NO in M. oryzae remains elusive.

40|$|Abstract Background Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is {{a notorious}} plant fungal {{pathogen}} which spreads across the world. Hypovirulence {{is a phenomenon}} where the virulence of fungal pathogens is decreased, even lost, due to mycovirus infection. The potential of hypoviruses for biological control of the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) has attracted much interest, and has led to discovery of new hypovirulent strains in other fungi. Results A hypovirulent strain, strain XG 36 - 1, was isolated from a typical lesion on the stem of rapeseed (Brassica napus) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Strain XG 36 - 1 grew on PDA very slowly (average 2. 5 ± 0. 1 mm/d) with sectoring, and developed abnormal colony morphology with few sclerotia. Unlike health strains (such as <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> XG- 13), it was unable to induce lesions on detached leaves of rapeseed. Sclerotia of strain XG 36 - 1 produced apothecia rarely. A sexual progeny test showed that the phenotypes of all 104 sexual progeny were not different from <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> XG- 13 which shows normal phenotype of S. sclerotiorum, and protoplast regeneration tests showed that 25. 5 % of the regenerants of strain XG 36 - 1 were recovered fully. Furthermore, the hypovirulence and its associated traits could be transmitted to XG 36 - 1 A 34 R, a hygromycin-resistance gene labelled sexual progeny of strain XG 36 - 1, by hyphal anastomosis. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that the cytoplasm of strain XG 36 - 1 was destroyed and granulated; the membranes of nuclei and mitochondria were disintegrated; and mitochondrial cristae were cavitated. Viral particles (about 40 nm) in hyphae of strain XG 36 - 1, but not in its sexual progeny and <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> XG- 13, could be observed with TEM, and several virus-like particles were uniquely enveloped by single layer membrane in the cells of strain XG 36 - 1. Furthermore, the viral particles could be co-transmitted with the hypovirulence traits through hyphal anastomosis. Conclusion Hypovirulence and its associated traits of strain XG 36 - 1 could be mediated by a fungal virus. Currently, we could not know the characteristic of this virus, but it likely represent {{a new type of}} mycovirus in S. sclerotiorum, and possibly in fungi. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecules {{are known}} to play crucial roles {{in a variety of}} developmental processes. The neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM is strongly implicated in neurulation and neural crest cell (NCC) migration and was thus studied in splotch (Sp) neural tube defect mutant embryos. At the 20 somite-stage of gestation day 9, Sp N-CAM was found to contain polysialic acid (PSA) side chains which are normally only present beginning at gestational day 11. Younger embryos at 12 and 14 somites also showed the presence of PSA on N-CAM, which was absent in controls. Enzymatic removal of PSA from N-CAM resulted in isoforms which migrated identically to PSA-free N-CAM isoforms in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The post-translational modification of N-CAM appears to be the primary target of the Sp gene. In view of N-CAM's importance during development, an alteration at a critical stage is likely to result in the cascade of abnormalities seen in Sp mutants.

Although they are active against a broad range of pathogens, bacteria have evolved different resistance mechanisms to avoid killing by AMPs. Since not much is known about the impact of efflux pumps on the susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to AMPs, especially to the cathelicidins, the aim of this study was to analyze whether Staphylococcus aureus can use efflux pumps to resist the antimicrobial effects of cathelicidins derived from different animal species (human, mouse, rabbit or cattle). For this purpose the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S. aureus field isolates for the cathelicidins LL- 37, mCRAMP, CAP 18, BMAP- 27 and BMAP- 28 in the presence and absence of different efflux pump inhibitors were determined. Furthermore, the MICs of mutants lacking SecDF, a member of the RND efflux pump family, were determined and compared to the MICs of their respective <b>wildtype</b> and complemented <b>strains.</b> The data demonstrated that after blocking RND-type efflux pumps with 1 -(1 -naphthylmethyl) -piperazine, the MICs for CAP 18, but not those for the other cathelicidins tested, were significantly decreased. In good correlation with these data, significantly decreased MICs for CAP 18 and also BMAP- 27 have been observed for SecDF knockout mutants as compared to their isogenic <b>wildtype</b> <b>strains.</b> In addition, the MIC values increased again after re-introducing a cloned secDF via plasmid complementation.

Mpd 1 was disrupted by insertional mutagenesis, and the resulting mpd 1 strains lacked all detectable NAD-linked mannitol 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity (EC 1. 1. 1. 17). The growth rates, sporulation, and spore viability of the mutant strains in vitro {{were not significantly different}} from the wild type. The viability of the mpd 1 spores when subjected to heat stress was comparable to wild type.

No secreted mannitol could be detected in wild type or mutants. Pathogenicity assays revealed the disruption of Mpd 1 did not affect lesion development, however the mutants were unable to sporulate.

40|$|Pyocyanin is an {{electrochemically}} active metabolite {{produced by}} the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is a recognized virulence factor and {{is involved in a}} variety of significant biological activities including gene expression, maintaining fitness of bacterial cells and biofilm formation. It is also recognized as an electron shuttle for bacterial respiration and as an antibacterial and antifungal agent. eDNA has also been demonstrated to be a major component in establishing P. aeruginosa biofilms. In this study we discovered that production of pyocyanin influences the binding of eDNA to P. aeruginosa PA 14 cells, mediated through intercalation of pyocyanin with eDNA. P. aeruginosa cell surface properties including cell size (hydrodynamic diameter), hydrophobicity and attractive surface energies were influenced by eDNA in the presence of pyocyanin, affecting physico-chemical interactions and promoting aggregation. A DphzA-G PA 14 mutant, deficient in pyocynain production, could not bind with eDNA resulting in a reduction in hydrodynamic diameter, a decrease in hydrophobicity, repulsive physico-chemical interactions and reduction in aggregation in comparison to the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> Removal of eDNA by DNase I treatment on the PA 14 <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> resulted in significant reduction in aggregation, cell surface hydrophobicity and size and an increase in repulsive physico-chemical interactions, similar {{to the level of the}} DphzA-G mutant.

40|$|The {{universal}} {{stress protein}} A (UspA) of E. coli is induced {{by a wide}} variety of stressful conditions and appears to be important in regulating the cell's overall stress response. However, the exact mechanism of uspA induction remains unknown. The purpose of this project was to identify potential regulators of the uspA gene. Regulators tested included the LexA repressor of the SOS regulon, and the sigma factors RpoH and RpoS. Sigma factors initiate transcription by recognizing target promoters and allowing RNA polymerase to bind. Most sigma factors are involved in allowing the cell to respond to a particular stressful condition, such as membrane stress or nutrient starvation. Using a bioluminescent reporter system in which the uspA promoter is fused to the lux operon from Vibrio fischeri, the level of uspA transcription under different stress conditions was quantified. When stressed with 5 mJ/m 2 UV radiation, lexA-independent mutants showed, on average, a six-fold increase in uspA induction compared to the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> The lexA-independent strain encodes a mutant form of the LexA repressor that cannot be cleaved by RecA and thus remains bound to the promoters of genes in the SOS regulon. The increased transcription levels of uspA in the lexA-independent strain suggest that uspA is {{not a member of the}} SOS regulon. Similarly, when ethanol stressed, uspA transcription in the rpoH mutant strain showed a four-fold increase over the rpoH <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain,</b> suggesting that RpoH is not involved in initiating uspA transcription.

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} occurs frequently between {{strains of}} the same alphaherpesvirus species. Studies of this phenomenon require techniques that can differentiate parental strains from putative recombinant progeny viruses. Usually, progeny viruses generated by co-infection of two distinguishable parental strains are first cloned by selection of a single plaque and then characterised by PCR. An assay designed to investigate recombination between two bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) strains lacking either the glycoprotein gC or gE ORF is described. A PCR assay was developed in which a single step co-amplifies both BHV- 1 glycoprotein-encoding sequences. Because the usual procedure for virus isolation, viral plaque picking, can lead to polyclonal virus preparations, a PCR protocol alone does not differentiate between samples containing recombinant viruses (gC+/gE+) and those containing a mixture of both single deleted parental strains (gC-/gE+ and gC+/gE-), and false positives resulting from recombination could occur. To reduce this possibility, double-label immunofluorescence staining of isolated plaques was developed, which coupled with PCR, allows straightforward discrimination between parental strains and progeny recombinant viruses. This assay will be useful for further studies of recombination, especially those evaluating the potential emergence of recombinants between BHV- 1 marker vaccine and <b>wildtype</b> <b>strains.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{variable}} {{expression of}} alternative specificity subunits by the type I restriction modification system SpnIII {{has been proven}} to differentially regulate important virulence factors. These gene expression differences are envisaged to translate into {{significant differences in the}} virulence of strains, dominated by different specificity subunits, in murine models of infection. The presence of this type I system in the core pneumococcal genome hints at a conserved, global mechanism of regulation, including that of virulence. The use of <b>wildtype</b> <b>strains</b> enriched in alternative specificity subunits has revealed that recombination within the spnIII locus is not reciprocal and is highly variable between strains. Despite this variability, methylation of the genome by different SpnIII variants results in differential gene expression and significant differences in models of invasive disease. The recombination within the spnIII locus appears to be much more complex than similar, previously reported systems. Recombination is not mediated by the classical homologous recombination pathways but is partially controlled by a site specific tyrosine recombinase. Investigations into the impact of SpnIII may be capable of improving our understanding of how this nasopharyngeal coloniser is capable of causing devastating invasive disease...|$|R

In all cases, high titers of antibodies capable of recognising LPS elaborating the identical structure as presented on the immunising glycoconjugate were obtained, {{and in most cases}} the derived sera also recognised heterologous strains including wild-type, but at lower titers. However, although serum bactericidal antibodies were consistently obtained against strains elaborating the same LPS structure as the immunising antigen, this functional response was not observed against wild-type strains. We identified several potentially competing neoepitopes that had been introduced via our conjugation strategies, which might compete with the conserved inner core oligosaccharide target region, thus reducing the antibody titers to epitopes which could facilitate bactericidal killing. This study has therefore identified key factors that are crucial to control in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining bactericidal antibodies to wild-type meningococcal cells with LPS-derived glycoconjugates. Glycoconjugates utilised in this study, have been found to contain epitopes that do not contribute to the derivation of antibodies that may facilitate bactericidal killing of <b>wildtype</b> <b>strains</b> and must be avoided in future LPS-based glycoconjugate preparations.

However, only 4 of these TCSTSs have been characterised experimentally. This project aimed {{to shed light on}} additional TCSTSs. In order to identify candidate TCSTSs, in silico analyses were performed, using data from the Microbial Signal Transduction database. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences were compared to those of experimentally-characterised TCSTSs. Predicted sub-cellular localisation, conservation among related Burkholderia strains, and possible horizontal transfer of TCSTS genes from other bacteria were also examined. The BPSL 1036 -BPSL 1037 OmpR-EnvZ orthologue, the BPSS 2246 hybrid histidine kinase, and the BPSL 1669 OmpR-like response regulator were selected for further characterisation. Either the BPSL 1036 -BPSL 1037 operon [Δ(1036 - 1037) ], BPSL 1037 (Δ 1037), BPSL 1036 (Δ 1036), BPSL 1669 (Δ 1669) or BPSS 2246 (Δ 2246) were deleted by allelic-exchange mutagenesis. A complementation vector for the Δ 1036 and Δ 1037 mutants was constructed by cloning the BPSL 1036 -BPSL 1037 operon into pBHR 1, a low-copy replicating plasmid, and successfully introduced into the B. pseudomallei wildtype, Δ 1036 and Δ 1037 strains.

The Δ(1036 - 1037), Δ 1037 and Δ 1036 strains also displayed similar swarming motility to the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> When cultured on Ashdown’s agar for 21 - 28 days, Δ 1037, Δ 1036, Δ 2246 and Δ 1669 colonies developed a distinct, hypermucoid morphology, absent in similarly-cultured Δ(1036 - 1037) and wildtype colonies. Both the mucoid strains and non-mucoid Δ(1036 - 1037) and wildtype strains secreted similar levels of type I capsule. However, the hypermucoid strains released increased quantities of extracellular DNA (eDNA), even though increased cell lysis, a possible eDNA release mechanism, was not observed in these strains. In static liquid medium, the Δ 1037 and Δ 1036 mutants developed altered pellicle architecture compared to the wildtype, while Δ(1036 - 1037), Δ 2246 and Δ 1669 did not. The complemented Δ 1037 and Δ 1036 strains produced similar quantities of eDNA and similar levels of pellicle formation in static liquid culture as the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> The virulence of each B. pseudomallei TCSTS mutant strain was assayed using the BALB/c acute melioidosis mouse model. All 5 TCSTS mutant strains caused disease at a similar rate to the <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain.</b> In vivo fitness of the Δ(1036 - 1037) and Δ 1037 strains was determined by simultaneously infecting mice with both the wildtype and a mutant strain; neither the Δ(1036 - 1037) nor Δ 1037 mutants displayed altered in vivo survival relative to the wildtype. Nevertheless, transcriptome profiling indicated that BPSL 1037 influences the expression of several known virulence factors. In conclusion, while not essential for acute disease, BPSL 1036 -BPSL 1037, BPSS 2246 and BPSL 1669 influence the release of eDNA, and the BPSL 1036 -BPSL 1037 system is required for normal pellicle biofilm formation. Further investigations may characterise the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions of each TCSTS that give rise to these phenotypes, contributing to an improved understanding of the B. pseudomallei regulatory mechanisms necessary for survival in a range of niches...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{contributor}} to Vibrio fischeri aminopeptidase activity is aminopeptidase N, PepN. Colonization assays revealed the pepN mutant strain to be deficient at forming dense aggregates and populating the host’s light organ compared to wildtype {{within the first}} 12 hours of colonization; however the mutant competed normally at 24 hours. To address the role of PepN in colonization initiation and establish additional phenotypes for the pepN mutant strain, stress response and other physiological assays were employed. Marked {{differences were found between}} pepN mutant and <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> in response to salinity, acidity, and antibiotic tolerance. This study has provided a foundation for future work on identifying a putative role for V. fischeri PepN in regulating stress response...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon source on isocitrate lyase {{formation}} was studied in a <b>wildtype</b> <b>strain</b> of Neurospora crassa {{and in a}} uridine-deficient mutant. A constitutive level of the enzyme was produced in a casein hydrolysate medium. The enzyme was repressed by glucose, although the two strains varied {{with respect to the}} degree of glucose repression. Acetate strongly stimulated isocitrate lyase formation. The enzyme formed in the presence of acetate differed in several respects from that formed in glucose-grown cells. Differences were found in pH-activity curves, Km values, and in sensitivity to phosphoenolpyruvate inhibition. Diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography allowed separation of two enzymatically active components which showed different rates of heat inactivation. These data indicate the presence of multiple forms of isocitrate lyase in Neurospora...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion is {{the first}} step in the {{pathogenesis}} of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections. The genes encoding the most prevalent adhesion factors CFA/I, CS 3 and CS 6 were cloned into Vibrio cholerae strain CVD 103 -HgR and expression of fimbriae was investigated in <b>wildtype</b> and recombinant <b>strains</b> by transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with immunolabelling and negative staining. Negative staining was effective in revealing CFA/I and CS 3, but not CS 6. Although morphology of fimbriae differed between <b>wildtype</b> and recombinant <b>strains,</b> corresponding surface antigens were recognized by specific antibodies. The present study provides evidence that ETEC-specific fimbriae can adequately be expressed in an attenuated V. cholerae vaccine strain and that immunoelectron microscopy is a critical tool to validate the surface expression of antigens in view of their possible suitability for recombinant vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a Gram-negative bacterium. It causes {{plants to}} produce {{crown gall disease}} because of the transfer, {{integration}} and expression of oncogenes encoded by the T-DNA (transferred DNA) region of the tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid. A set of transferred genes directs the production of bacterial nutrients, called opines, formed by condensation of an amino acid and a keto acid or a sugar. Transformed cells synthesize and secrete substantial quantities of particular opines, which A. tumefaciens then uses as a carbon and sometimes nitrogen source. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains are usually classified {{on the basis of}} the opines they can catabolize. Because of the ability to transfer DNA between different kingdoms, A. tumefaciens is also frequently used to generate transgenic plants. This study analyses five poorly characterized <b>wildtype</b> Agrobacterium <b>strains,</b> 1 D 1108, 1 D 1460, 1 D 132, 1 D 1478 and 1 D 1487, isolated from Euonymus, cane, cherry, Salix and apple, respectively. Partial Ti-plasmid sequence analysis demonstrated that the five strains harbour the nopaline-type Ti plasmid. Tumorigenesis and transient transformation assays of the five analysed and six <b>wildtype</b> A. tumefaciens <b>strains</b> were performed with selected plant species, including two or three species of Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Solanaceae, Apiaceae and Leguminosae. The A. tumefaciens strains 1 D 1108, 1 D 1460 and 1 D 1478 showed higher transformation efficiencies than the previously characterized A. tumefaciens strains with several economically important crops. These data suggest the potential use of these newly characterized <b>wildtype</b> A. tumefaciens <b>strains</b> in transient transformation assays with certain plant species...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{develops}} {{through a}} multistep {{process in which}} normal cells progress to malignant tumors via the evolution of their genomes {{as a result of}} the acquisition of mutations in cancer driver genes. The number, identity and mode of action of cancer driver genes, and how they contribute to tumor evolution is largely unknown. This study deployed the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) as an insertional mutagen to find both the driver genes and the networks in which they function. Using deep insertion site sequencing we identified around 31000 retroviral integration sites in 604 MMTV-induced mammary tumors from mice with mammary gland-specific deletion of Trp 53, Pten heterozygous knockout mice, or <b>wildtype</b> <b>strains.</b> We identified 18 known common integration sites (CISs) and 12 previously unknown CISs marking new candidate cancer genes. Members of the Wnt, Fgf, Fgfr, Rspo and Pdgfr gene families were commonly mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion. The sequence data we generated yielded also information on the clonality of insertions in individual tumors, allowing us to develop a data-driven model of MMTV-induced tumor development. Insertional mutations near Wnt and Fgf genes mark the earliest "initiating" events in MMTV induced tumorigenesis, whereas Fgfr genes are targeted later during tumor progression. Our data shows that insertional mutagenesis can be used to discover the mutational networks, the timing of mutations, and the genes that initiate and drive tumor evolution...|$|R
