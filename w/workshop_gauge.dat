We provide evidence to support the conjecture that all N=(2, 2) non-linear sigma-models can be described by these fields. This in its turn leads to interesting consequences about the geometry of the target manifolds. One immediate corollary of this conjecture is the existence of a potential for hyper-Kahler manifolds, different from the Kahler potential, which does not only allow for the computation of the metric, but of the three fundamental two-forms as well. Several examples are provided: WZW models on SU(2) x U(1) and SU(2) x SU(2) and four-dimensional special hyper-Kahler manifolds.

40|$|The {{role of the}} Equivalence Principle (EP) in {{classical}} and quantum mechanics is reviewed. It is shown that the weak EP has a counterpart in quantum theory, a Quantum Equivalence Principle (QEP). This implies that also in the quantum domain the geometrisation of the gravitational interaction is an operational procedure similar to the procedure {{in classical}} physics. This QEP {{can be used for}} showing that it is only the usual Schrödinger equation coupled to gravito [...] inertial fields which obeys our equivalence principle. In addition, the QEP applied to a generalised Pauli equation including spin results in a characterisation of the gravitational fields which can be identified with the Newtonian potential and with torsion. Also, in the classical limit it is possible to state beside the usual EP for the path an EP for the spin which again may be used for introducing torsion as a gravitational field.

40|$|We give {{background}} material and {{some details of}} calculations for two recent papers [1, 2] where we derived a path integral representation of the transition element for supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in one dimension (quantum mechanics). Our approach starts from a Hamiltonian H(x̂, p̂, ψ̂, ψ̂^†) with a priori operator ordering. By inserting {{a finite number of}} complete sets of x eigenstates, p eigenstates and fermionic coherent states, we obtain the discretized path integral and the discretized propagators and vertices in closed form. Taking the continuum limit we read off the Feynman rules and measure of the continuum theory which differ from those often assumed. In particular, mode regularization of the continuum theory is shown in an example to give incorrect results. As a consequence of time-slicing, the action and Feynman rules, although without any ambiguities, are necessarily noncovariant, but the final results are covariant if Ĥ is covariant. All our derivations are exact. Two loop calculations confirm our results. Comment: 17 pages, LaTeX, with one figure (needs psfig).
