He {{would have had to}} say the words to her himself before she {{believed}} them his. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> her to do now? was the only question she asked herself. To follow him was useless, for in that rain and darkness two people might have searched for each other all night in a single field. That he would go to the Spittal, thinking her in Rintoul's dogcart, she did not doubt; and his distress was painful to her to think of. But not knowing that the burns were in flood, she underestimated his danger.|$|E

6000|$|At {{this remark}} Uncle Isham fired up. Although {{the conduct of}} his {{mistress}} troubled him at times very much he was intensely loyal to her, and he instantly caught {{the meaning of this}} aspersion against her. [...] "Now, look h'yar, Aun' Patsy," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "wot you talkin' 'bout? Wot ole miss got to do wid Mister Crof' sprainin' he ankle?

6000|$|The last {{inhabitant}} {{of these}} woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh Quoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough), who occupied Wyman's tenement--Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor {{said that he}} had been a soldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his battles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went to St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic. He was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to. He wore a greatcoat in midsummer, being affected with the trembling delirium, and his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road at the foot of Brister's Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not remembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when his comrades avoided it as [...] "an unlucky castle," [...] I visited it. There lay his old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his raised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl broken at the fountain. The last could never have been the symbol of his death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of Brister's Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of diamonds, spades, and hearts, were scattered over the floor. One black chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the next apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden, which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing to those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was overrun with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm cap or mittens <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> more.|$|E

Cooper considers his father's book Families to be [...] "sort of a guide on...how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>wanted</b> me to live my life and the choices <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>wanted</b> me to make.

Its website states, [...] "We, {{the members of}} that church, asked ourselves, 'Would Jesus want {{to hang out with}} folks at a traditional institutional church? or <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to hang out over a beer in a bar or coffee in a restaurant?' The resounding answer was the latter. We chose coffee over beer because of our support for the budding AA movement in 1960." ...|$|E

Abdal {{said he was}} worried that the {{threatened}} Quran-burning would cause Christians in Iraq to be targeted again {{after a period of}} relative calm, and said: [...] "I would like {{to send a message to}} the pastor who is in America; he lives in a society that protects humans and religious beliefs. Why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to harm Christians in Iraq? This is dangerous. He should realize that we live in cultures of various denominations, especially in Iraq." ...|$|E

Another psychiatric patient is roaming the hospital {{pretending to be a}} locum and murdering patients with drug overdoses. He breaks into Liz's room while Andrew is visiting her, and stabs Andrew with a needle containing insulin. Raj rescues Andrew and the casualty team, assisted by the newly reunited Claire and Scissors, attempt to treat him. With Claire asking Andrew if he were to be in a vegatative state, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> her to euthanise him. The series closes with the team carrying a convulsing Andrew towards a resuscitation room.|$|E
5000|$|King {{is known}} to despise {{organized}} religion and expresses his views in his songwriting. In a 2006 interview with Blabbermouth.net, King expressed his anti-religious views: [...] "I don't really have a life philosophy; my thing is just rebelling against pretty much organized religion. That is my main thing, because personally I think it's a crutch for people that are too weak to get through life on their own. I'm {{the kind of guy}} that says if I don't see it, then it doesn't work. And nobody can show me God." [...] When asked by Revolver Magazine what superpower <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> if he was a supervillain, King replied [...] "the ability to burst a church into flames by simply walking by it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} good pacing in the beginning, {{but it gets}} lost, dispersed, and ends up being a victim of its bewildering musical numbers, which include: Russell, Freddy Fernández, and Gustavo Villacampa singing [...] "Perfida" [...] while shirtless in the bathroom; Russell wearing a straw hat and singing [...] "Muchachita" [...] (his big hit) to Irma Castillón, as they both tap-dance in the Hollywood style; in an audition, Russell singing [...] "Quiéreme mucho" [...] in Spanish and English, while Antonio Raxel makes the comment that if Russell sings in English, <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> his salary to be paid in dollars instead of pesos; and Russell singing [...] "Amor, Amor, Amor" [...] in a disconcerting musical number, {{complete}} with a couple from prehistoric times, another from the 8th century, an Arab with his harem, and Cupid. It's shocking and absurd. But in its defense, one can say that Russell, from a distance, {{does not appear to}} be so stuck-up anymore. There have been others who have been worse.|$|E

5000|$|After Lauren {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Brad had a daughter, Laura Morgan from All About Soap speculated as to whether Matt and Terese could have an affair, calling them [...] "outsiders to the situation" [...] and adding [...] "Will Mrs Willis turn to understanding Matt for a shoulder to cry on? It could be a brilliant twist to the tale!" [...] When Matt and Lauren renewed their vows, a Daily Record reporter noted that they looked [...] "a picture of happiness". Morgan later admitted that she was disappointed in Matt for listening to Terese and arresting Paige. She said [...] "Whatever happened to family loyalty? Lauren's been on cloud nine since finding her daughter - why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> {{to try to put}} a spanner in the works and ruin her happiness? We know he's got a duty as a copper, but he should just tell Terese to back off!" [...] Helen Vnuk of TV Week included Matt in her feature on soap heroes. She stated that [...] "Matt wasn't perfect" [...] and that his [...] "ultimate sacrifice cost him his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} motivations of Ward in the episode, Gregg {{explained}} [...] "Ward {{seems to think}} that he’s redeemable, and yet for every step he takes that seems to be about mending fences with either Skye or Coulson, he seems to do something that’s equally psychotic. The speech that was in last week’s episode, the bit {{between the two of them}} before he turned Ward over, it seems like Coulson takes the deaths of Victoria Hand and others very seriously. I don’t see how Ward is going to explain that away, from Coulson’s point of view." [...] Then asked if Coulson would kill Ward, Gregg stated [...] "That question actually goes right to the heart of Coulson. <b>Would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to? I’m sure Coulson does, but I also feel like there’s a cost to not being Hydra. To Coulson, there’s a very clear line that you cross over when you indulge your more primitive retribution-based desires, that suddenly really starts to rupture the membrane between you and what you’re fighting against." ...|$|E
5000|$|Miller also openly {{complained that}} getting guests had become {{increasingly}} difficult after Leno took over from Carson. He began openly accusing Leno's agent Helen Kushnick of unethical strong-arm booking tactics, {{which was a}} charge previously made by Arsenio Hall. Miller blasted Leno and Kushnick's press conference earlier that month that denied such tactics were being used. After the cancellation Miller told an interviewer [...] "I don't like Jay and The Tonight Show. We just had problems, and I don't {{like the way they}} do business. ...There are ways to book shows and be tactful about it. Arsenio is very classy about it. The other show is not very tactful about it." [...] Elsewhere Miller said that while he had only met Hall twice [...] "he's a legitimate human being who doesn't bullshit you." [...] He called Hall classy and expressed interest at becoming better friends. In contrast, he said of Leno [...] "Jay and I were very good friends at one point. I don’t think I'd talk to him again, nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to talk to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Other critics, however, {{were not}} so keen on Hawley's change in direction: The Independent on Sunday gave the record three stars out of five, calling it [...] "a bewildering move... Hawley does {{psychedelic}} rock with more style, elegance and panache than most. None of which answers the question: why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to?", while Pitchfork considered the album to be [...] "an out-and-out miscalculation by Hawley of his own strengths... an unwelcome return to a less distinguished period in Hawley's career, back before {{he knew how to}} make more beguiling music than this." [...] MusicOMH felt that [...] "it's great to hear Richard Hawley expanding his horizons and there's a lot to enjoy in this album" [...] but that [...] "the overall result is not altogether satisfying: some of the tracks seem overlong, as if the temptation to thrown in just a few more special effects has taken over from crafting a coherent piece of music... if some of the sound could be better defined, and the special effects shaken on with a slightly lighter hand, it would be more coherent and ultimately more impressive".|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Guo Chongtao {{had promised}} Wang Zongbi {{the post of}} {{military}} governor of Xichuan, but did not actually made the recommendation to Emperor Zhuangzong. To put pressure on Guo, Wang Zongbi led a group of Former Shu officials and publicly met with Li Jiji, recommending Guo to be the military governor of Xichuan. Li Jiji began to suspect Guo of wanting to occupy the Shu lands and separate from Later Tang, and he stated to Guo, [...] "The Lord Emperor Zhuangzong) depends on you, Shizhong, like a mountain and would not let you leave the imperial government. How <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to abandon you, with so much accomplishments, in a wild land? This is not something I would dare to discuss. Have those men go to the palace Luoyang) to beg the Lord themselves." [...] As, at that time, the former Former Shu eunch-general Song Guangbao (宋光葆), whose brother Song Guangsi Wang Zongbi had killed in a purge subsequent to his seizure of Wang Yan, made accusations against Wang Zongbi, and Wang Zongbi was also refusing to surrender more wealth from the treasury to reward the Later Tang soldiers, the soldiers were clamoring. In order to clear himself, Guo had Wang Zongbi, along with his allies Wang Zongxun and Wang Zongwo (王宗渥), arrested and executed.|$|E
5000|$|Once he was {{discharged}} from service {{he was able}} to commence his studies and developed his talents as an artist with a particular liking for sculpture. He enrolled in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in Venice and graduated there with honors in 1929; he entered at the encouragement of his older brother Giovanni and his parish priest Vittorio Morando. One of the major themes of his works was religious art. He soon felt a religious vocation after meeting the Franciscan priest Amadio Oliviero in 1932 (the two became good friends) and decided to become a professed religious - he later entered the Order of Friars Minor on 7 December 1933. In his letter of recommendation his pastor wrote to the friars that [...] "the order is receiving not only an artist but a saint". His novitiate commenced in 1935 and he assumed the religious name of [...] "Claudio" [...] while later making his religious vows in 1936 and being sent to the convent of San Francesco in Vittorio Veneto. In 1930 he won a competition to have a statue he made put up but this turned into a failure as he was denied this because he did not support nor <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> to support fascism.|$|E
5000|$|GianArthur {{has said}} that when he was a child, his father asked him what sort of superpower <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to have. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to play any {{instrument}} and speak any language in the world. GianArthur now says that he feels different instruments are like different musical dialects, and plays the guitar and piano, among other instruments. GianArthur is also largely inspired by his faith. In Wondaland Presents: The Future, he said that he tries [...] "to be ready" [...] for when God inspires him to write a song.|$|R
