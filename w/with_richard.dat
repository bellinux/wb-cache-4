5|$|Geoffrey quarrelled <b>with</b> <b>Richard</b> in 1196 in Normandy {{while the}} {{archbishop}} {{was attempting to}} return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York, and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198.

Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided <b>with</b> <b>Richard</b> in the conflict.
