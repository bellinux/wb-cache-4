He ordered his brother-in-law, General Martín Perfecto de Cos to bring approximately 500soldiers to Texas. Cos {{and his men}} arrived in Goliad on October 2. Three days later, after learning of the events at Gonzales, the soldiers left for San Antonio de Béxar.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Disneyland Railroad opened, A, B, and C tickets were {{introduced}} in Disneyland for admission to its rides, and C tickets, the highest-ranked tickets, were required to ride the DRR. These tickets were joined by the higher-ranked D ticket in 1956, and D tickets from that point forward <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{gain access to the}} DRR.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> the doors and wall plate.|$|E
5|$|After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle {{became the}} primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The {{crossbow}} {{was an important}} military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon {{by the time of}} Richard Imany crossbows and even more quarrels <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> supply royal forces. Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> work at the artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

Furthermore, a comparison between naive and epileptic rats <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess to which degree P-gp upregulation affects cerebral uptake of [11 C]flumazenil. Ultimately, [11 C]flumazenil studies in both pharmacoresistant and pharmacosensitive patients with epilepsy, {{as well as in}} healthy volunteers <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> elucidate this important issue.|$|R

5|$|Ledbury {{was engaged}} in escorting major {{warships}} and Fleet auxiliaries in the North Sea until late June 1942, when she {{was attached to the}} ocean escort of the convoy PQ17. Mariners that took part in convoys delivering supplies to Russia remember vividly the biting cold and the continual fear of attack by air or sea. The supplies were vital in that they <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> keep Russia in the war following her invasion by German forces in 1941. The PQ17 convoy, which left Iceland at the end of June 1942, is known particularly for the tremendous losses among the merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 2014, the Inkatha Freedom Party {{expressed}} its {{concern for}} the residents of Khuma as repairs to their homes were delayed and had not yet commenced. Provincial government spokesperson, Bonolo Mohlakoana said that construction was delayed partly {{due to a lack}} of structural engineers, which <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess the structural damage caused to the houses.

5|$|Rapid forces, {{whether for}} an {{offensive}} or defensive purpose, <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> deny vital locations to the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks. As early as 1936 the French had commissioned {{the design of}} light airborne tanks, but these plans had been abandoned in 1940, as they possessed no cargo planes large enough to carry them. A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing. These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles, supplied by overseas shipping.|$|E
5|$|The German and the Soviet armies used horses {{until the}} end of the war for {{transportation}} of troops and supplies. The German Army, strapped for motorised transport because its factories <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> produce tanks and aircraft, used around 2.75 million horses—more than it had used in World War I. One German infantry division in Normandy in 1944 had 5,000 horses. The Soviets used 3.5 million horses.|$|E

Considerable engineering works <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> cope with the widening of the station, including the removal of a short tunnel {{to the west of the}} station. The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933, and the station name was changed to simply Parson Street in November 1933. The new station included covered waiting shelters, and a booking office on the road bridge. Again, no goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|The statue was {{restored}} in 2006 with funds {{donated by the}} university's alumni from the Class of 1956. Approximately $150,000 in reunion campaign funds were used to restore the four historic gates on the university's historic Queens Campus and the William the Silent statue. It was cleaned to remove the effects of graffiti and transparent tape residue, and conservation efforts <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> restore the statue's bronze casting and granite base.|$|E
5|$|Thirty CH-21 Shawnee {{helicopters}} <b>were</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> airlift {{the entire}} 1st Battalion, ARVN 11th Infantry Regiment, but only ten were available.

These troops had to hold their positions until the rest of the battalions had arrived. Because of the delay in the arrival of the regular South Vietnamese army units, two Civil Guard battalions of Task Forces A and B—under the command of Dinh Tuong provincial chief Major Lam Quang Tho—were left to march against enemy positions by themselves.|$|E
