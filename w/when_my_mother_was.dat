The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> nine years old, and I was named in her honour.

But though the new town is to me a glass through which I look at the old, the people I see passing up and down these wynds, sitting, nightcapped, on their barrow-shafts, hobbling in their blacks to church on Sunday, are less those I saw in my childhood than their fathers and mothers who did these things in the same way <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> young.

During all those years, {{the young man had}} never {{forgotten}} to keep up a close correspondence with his people in Germany. Already, in 1764, during his Yorkshire days, William Herschel had managed out of his Savings as an oboe-player to make a short trip to his old home; and his sister Carolina, afterwards his chief assistant in his astronomical labours, notes with pleasure the delight she felt in having her beloved brother with her once more, though she, poor girl, being cook to the household apparently, could only enjoy his society when she was not employed [...] "in the drudgery of the scullery." [...] A year later, when William had returned to England again, and had just received his appointment as organist at Halifax, his father, Isaac, had a stroke of paralysis which ended his violin-playing for ever, and forced him to rely thenceforth upon copying music for a precarious livelihood. In 1767 he died, and poor Carolina saw before her in prospect nothing but a life of that domestic drudgery which she so disliked. [...] "I could not bear the idea of being turned into a housemaid," [...] she says; and she thought that if only she could take a few lessons in music and fancy work she might get [...] "a place as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of French would be no objection." [...] But, unhappily, good dame Herschel, like many other uneducated and narrow-minded persons, had a strange dread of too much knowledge. She thought that [...] "nothing further was needed," [...] says Carolina, [...] "than to send me two or three months to a sempstress to be taught to make household linen; so all that my father could do was to indulge me sometimes with a short lesson on the violin <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> either in good humour or out of the way. It was her certain belief that my brother William would have returned to his country, and my eldest brother would not have looked so high, if they had had a little less learning."

Not for other eyes those long vigils when, night about, we sat watching, nor the awful nights when we stood together, teeth clenched—waiting—it must be now. And it was not then; her hand became cooler, her breathing more easy; she smiled to us.

6000|$|... "I {{was a very}} {{practical}} young Socialist when I first met him," [...] said Trefusis. [...] "When Brown was an unknown and wretchedly poor man, my mother, at the petition {{of a friend of}} his, charitably bought one of his pictures for thirty pounds, which he was very glad to get. Years afterwards, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> dead, and Brown famous, I was offered eight hundred pounds for this picture, which was, by-the-bye, a very bad one in my opinion. Now, after making the usual unjust allowance for interest on thirty pounds for twelve years or so that had elapsed, the sale of the picture would have brought me in a profit of over seven hundred and fifty pounds, an unearned increment to which I had no righteous claim. My solicitor, to whom I mentioned the matter, was of opinion that I might justifiably pocket the seven hundred and fifty pounds as reward for my mother's benevolence in buying a presumably worthless picture from an obscure painter. But he failed to convince me that I ought to be paid for my mother's virtues, though we agreed that neither I nor my mother had received any return in the shape of pleasure in contemplating the work, which had deteriorated considerably by the fading of the colors since its purchase. At last I went to Brown's studio with the picture, and told him that it was worth nothing to me, as I thought it a particularly bad one, and that he might have it back again for fifteen pounds, half the first price. He at once told me that I could get from any dealer more for it than he could afford to give me; but he told me too that I had no right to make a profit out of his work, and that he would give me the original price of thirty pounds. I took it, and then sent him the man who had offered me the eight hundred. To my discomfiture Brown refused to sell it on any terms, because he considered it unworthy of his reputation. The man bid up to fifteen hundred, but Brown held out; and I found that instead of putting seven hundred and seventy pounds into his pocket I had taken thirty out of it. I accordingly offered to return the thirty pieces. Brown, taking the offer as an insult, declined all further communication with me. I then insisted on the matter being submitted to arbitration, and demanded fifteen hundred pounds as the full exchange value of the picture. All the arbitrators agreed that this was monstrous, whereupon I contended that if they denied my right to the value in exchange, they must admit my right to the value in use. They assented to this after putting off their decision for a fortnight in order to read Adam Smith and discover what on earth I meant by my values in use and exchange. I now showed that the picture had no value in use to me, as I disliked it, and that therefore I was entitled to nothing, and that Brown must take back the thirty pounds. They were glad to concede this also to me, as they were all artist friends of Brown, and wished him not to lose money by the transaction, though they of course privately thought that the picture was, as I described it, a bad one. After that Brown and I became very good friends. He tolerated my advances, at first lest it should seem that he was annoyed by my disparagement of his work. Subsequently he fell into my views much as you have done." ...|$|E

My Swedish grandmother was the daughter of a dairy farmer who lived near Hedemora. My Swedish grandfather worked as a clerk for the Swedish railways in the Stockholm station. His avocation was painting, which absorbed more of his psychic energy than his career. At least some of the murals in the Stockholm station are a remnant of his handiwork.

But if HD even today is not widely known, even within medicine, in fact the rediscovery of Mendel in 1900 drew considerable scientific attention to this disorder over a century ago. By 1908 Hunting-ton’s had attracted so much interest among neurologists and psychiatrists that the journal Neurographs devoted an entire special issue to the disease [1]. Unfortu-nately the social and scientific movement for “better breeding ” known as eugenics–from the Greek word eugenes meaning “good in birth”–also {{took an interest in}} Huntington’s [2]. Addressing the historical impact of eugenics on Huntington’s disease families and on HD research can help explain the secrecy and shame that still often surrounds the illness. It can also suggest ways to move beyond this troubling inheritance in the future. Eugenics today is often narrowly equated with the atrocities of Nazi Germany or dismissed as “pseu-doscience”. However for much of the 20 th century, eugenic thought was an inextricable aspect {{of some of the most}} important cultural and social movements worldwide [3, 4].

To gratify this curiosity, which is so [...] natural to a reader, I design this paper and my next as prefatory [...] discourses to my following writings; and shall give some account in [...] them of the persons that are engaged in this work. As the chief [...] trouble of compiling, digesting, and correcting will fall to my [...] share, I must do myself the justice to open the work with my own [...] history.... There runs {{a story in the}} family, that <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> [...] <b>was</b> gone with child of me about three months, she dreamt that she [...] was brought to bed of a judge. Whether this might proceed from a [...] lawsuit which was then depending in the family, or my father’s being [...] a justice of the peace, I cannot determine; for I am not so vain as [...] to think it presaged any dignity that I should arrive at in my [...] future life, though that was the interpretation which the [...] neighbourhood put upon it. The gravity of my behaviour at my very [...] first appearance in the world, and all the time that I sucked, [...] seemed to favour <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> dream; for, as she has often told me, I [...] threw away my rattle before I was two months old, and would not make [...] use of my coral till they had taken away the bells from it.|$|R

I remember, the day they {{finished}} the malt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it; for we'd a plum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my mother,--she was a fine dark-eyed woman, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was,--the little wench 'ull be as like her as two peas." [...] Here Mr. Tulliver put his stick between his legs, and took out his snuff-box, for the greater enjoyment of this anecdote, which dropped from him in fragments, as if he every other moment lost narration in vision. [...] "I was a little chap no higher much than <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> knee,--she <b>was</b> sore fond of us children, Gritty and me,--and so I said to her, 'Mother,' I said, 'shall we have plum-pudding every day because o' the malt-house? She used to tell me o' that till her dying day. She was but a young woman <b>when</b> she died, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was.</b> But it's forty good year since they finished the malt-house, and it isn't many days out of 'em all as I haven't looked out into the yard there, the first thing in the morning,--all weathers, from year's end to year's end. I should go off my head in a new place. I should be like as if I'd lost my way. It's all hard, whichever way I look at it,--the harness 'ull gall me, but it 'ud be summat to draw along the old road, instead of a new un." ...|$|R
