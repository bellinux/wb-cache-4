60|$|<b>WATER</b> <b>AVENS</b> (G. rivale).--Quaint little ruddy half-expanded blossoms, {{called by}} the villagers Granny's Night-caps. (G. intermedium).--Really intermediate--probably hybrid. Found once in a copse between Boyatt Lane and the Southampton Road.|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the <b>water</b> <b>avens</b> and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Water</b> of <b>Aven</b> (or A'an) (an t-Uisge Bàn) is a {{tributary}} of the Water of Feugh, itself the largest {{tributary of}} the River Dee, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The <b>Water</b> of <b>Aven</b> rises at Loch Tennet, where the historic counties of Aberdeenshire, Angus and Kincardineshire meet and flows for approximately 15 km to its confluence with the Feugh near Whitestone. [...] The <b>Water</b> of <b>Aven</b> forms the historic boundary between Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire for its entire length and the lower 4.5 km are designated as part of the River Dee Special Area of Conservation, due to its importance for Atlantic salmon and Eurasian otter.|$|R

5000|$|The word Strachan is an anglicized {{derivative}} with {{origins in}} the Scottish Gaelic (or 'Scottis') language.

50|$|Finzean {{occupies}} the upper catchment of the Water of Feugh within {{the area of}} the Lower Deeside, the main tributary of the River Dee. The southern boundary of Finzean is the old county boundary between Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire which follows the <b>Water</b> of <b>Aven</b> (or A'an) from Loch Tennet to the Feughside Inn at Whitestone. The eastern boundary varies slightly between historic parish boundaries and modern-day polling district boundaries, but generally follows the route of the minor road north from Whitestone towards Potarch. The northern boundary of Finzean follows the watershed separating the Feugh catchment from the Burn of Cattie, although it runs slightly to the north of this ridge {{in the eastern part of}} the parish, crossing the B976 at Berrysloch. The western boundary of Finzean is the watershed separating the Feugh from Glen Tanar and Glen Esk.|$|R

50|$|In the near-natural {{riparian}} woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring {{yellow wood}} anemone, bulbous corydalis and lesser celandine blossom in the woods.

There are also marsh marigold meadows which are also graced by flowers such as the western marsh orchid, <b>water</b> <b>avens</b> and goldilocks buttercup.|$|E
5000|$|Geum rivale, the <b>water</b> <b>avens,</b> is a {{flowering}} plant {{of the family}} Rosaceae. Other names for the plant are nodding avens, drooping avens, cure-all, water flower and indian chocolate. It is native to much of Europe, {{with the exception of}} Mediterranean areas, as well as some parts of Central Asia and North America. [...] In North America, it is known as purple avens. It grows in bogs and damp meadows, and produces nodding red flowers from May to September.|$|E

The ledges also support woodrush, polypody and <b>water</b> <b>avens,</b> purple saxifrage, yellow saxifrage, hoary whitlowgrass and roseroot. Blue moor-grass can also be found, with sheep's-fescue and herbs such as thyme, salad burnet and common rock-rose. There is wild thyme, common milkwort, fairy flax, bird's-foot trefoil, autumn gentian, harebell, eyebright.|$|E
5000|$|G. rivale is pollinated {{primarily}} by bees, less often by flies and beetles. As the flower matures, elongation of the stamens ensures it self-fertilises if not already cross-pollinated. The flowers stigmas mature before the stamens. It begins flowering {{a little earlier}} than G. urbanum, so early pollinations will be within the gene-pool of the single species. The seeds of <b>Water</b> <b>Avens</b> are burr-like, and are distributed after being caught in the coats of rabbits and other small mammals, and by rhizomal growth ...|$|E
50|$|Usually {{reaching}} a height between 20 and 60 cm, wood avens blooms between May and August, and its flowers are 1 - 2 cm in diameter, having five bright yellow petals. The hermaphrodite flowers are scented and pollinated by bees. The fruits have burrs, {{which are used}} for dispersal by getting caught in the fur of rabbits and other animals. The root {{is used as a}} spice in soups and also for flavouring ale.Geum urbanum hybridises fairly regularly with Geum rivale (<b>water</b> <b>avens),</b> as they are closely related and occur together.|$|E

50|$|Burgate Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI. Its 75 acre are {{particularly}} {{good example of}} the type of oak-hornbeam woodland characteristic of this part of north Suffolk. It is ancient, with a coppice-with-standards structure and continues to support entirely semi-natural stands. Many giant coppiced stools are present which indicate its great antiquity. The ground flora is diverse and includes several species that are indicators of ancient woodland, including one rarity. The ground flora contains much Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis) with frequent Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Enchanter's Nightshade (Circaea lutetiana), Sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and <b>Water</b> <b>Avens</b> (Geum rivale). A number of uncommon species are present including Herb Paris (Paris quadrifolia), Yellow Archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), Hairy Woodrush (Luzula pilosa) and the rare Lungwort (Pulmonaria officinalis).|$|E
5000|$|The north-facing amphitheatre-shaped {{valley of}} Cwm Idwal with its dark cliffs {{has a unique}} flora, and some plants here are the most southerly {{remnants}} in Britain of the Arctic/Alpine flora. The Snowdon lily (Lloydia serotina) is found here, high on mountain ledges, {{the only place in}} Britain where it is found. Other Alpine species include the purple saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia), tufted saxifrage (Saxifraga cespitosa), Alpine meadow rue (Thalictrum alpinum) and mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna). Because of the scientific interest of this valley, sheep have been excluded from it to allow the native plants to flourish and it has been made into a National Nature Reserve. The lake itself is shallow and fringed with rushes, reeds and bottle sedge (Carex rostrata). Plants growing in the water or on the damp ground nearby include awlwort, pillwort, waterwort and spring quillwort (Isoetes echinospora). Other plants growing on damp shady ledges include the Welsh poppy (Meconopsis cambrica), the wood-rush (Lazula sylvatica), <b>water</b> <b>avens</b> (Geum rivale), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and golden rod (Solidago virgaurea). Animals that live here include badgers, foxes and polecats as well as buzzards (Buteo buteo), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), skylarks (Alauda arvensis), black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and red grouse (Lagopus lagopus).|$|E
