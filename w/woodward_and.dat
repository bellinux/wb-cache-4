5|$|Starting in 1924, {{officials}} in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from Detroit to run northwesterly {{across the state}} to Ludington, bisecting the angle created by <b>Woodward</b> <b>and</b> Grand River avenues.

5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur off-air reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched {{a search for a}} video recording of the play, uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, but it seems that a full off-air audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making of the play in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian <b>Woodward,</b> <b>and</b> the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play. In November 2008, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, narrated by Bob Harris, about Dylan's visit to London and the making of the play.|$|E

5|$|The {{road that}} is {{currently}} SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in <b>Woodward</b> <b>and</b> headed north, then turned east {{north of the city}} and headed to Boiling Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing through the park and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road through the park had been removed from the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the {{legislature}} passed the Aldrich Act; {{combined with the}} approval of the Bond Issue Act during an election that April, the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System. The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so. Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of <b>Woodward</b> <b>and</b> Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way traffic light.|$|E

It {{plays in}} black, blue and white kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, {{where it has been}} since the late 19th century, {{following}} its establishment in 1865.

25|$|Based {{on these}} revelations, Texas A history {{professor}} Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned {{for the release}} of the information, argued that <b>Woodward</b> <b>and</b> Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, {{that the purpose of the}} break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of the New York Times, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that <b>Woodward</b> <b>and</b> Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.|$|E
