5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> co-operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team {{a chance to play}} with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E
5|$|MDOT {{operates}} 67rest {{areas and}} 14welcome {{centers in the}} state, all {{named in honor of}} retired department employees, although in some cases an honoree's name may be dropped from the rest area. Eight of these are along US131, providing bathroom facilities, dog runs, picnic areas and usually vending machines. The rest areas near Kalamazoo, Rockford, Big Rapids and Tustin serve southbound traffic while those near Morley and Cadillac serve the northbound side of the freeway. The two near Manton and Fife Lake are accessible from both directions. A ninth rest area used to exist near Cutlerville on the northbound side of US131, but this location was demolished on January 22, 2001, {{to make way for the}} interchange with M-6. The department <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> replacement near Dorr, in northern Allegan County, but the plans were canceled in late 2001.|$|E

5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball {{announced that they}} had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 million loan from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E
