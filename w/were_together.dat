5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown <b>were</b> <b>together</b> in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E

5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter <b>were</b> <b>together</b> in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The role of Johnny {{was written}} by Jarmusch {{specifically}} for Joe Strummer, {{who had been the}} frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two <b>were</b> <b>together</b> in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set to joke with the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role.|$|E
5|$|Upon Sophia's birth, King George ensured {{his daughters}} and younger sons would have allowances; through a {{provision}} of Parliament, Sophia and her elder sisters were each {{to receive an}} annual income of £6,000 either upon their marriages or the king's death. The royal household was very rigid and formal, even when only the royal family <b>were</b> <b>together</b> in private. For instance, when the King entered a room, his daughters were expected to stand up, remain silent until addressed, and not leave until given permission. Queen Charlotte made attempts to be economical where possible; the younger princesses wore country-made dresses, which were less expensive, and ate plain food.|$|E

They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} fits of swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They <b>were</b> <b>together</b> until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After an {{interlude}} {{of several}} months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at Cyzicus. Alcibiades {{had been forced to}} flee from Sestos to Cardia to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, {{but as soon as the}} Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and Mindarus, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, <b>were</b> <b>together</b> plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans' retreat.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they <b>were</b> <b>together</b> at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1666 as the Great Fire of London {{swept through}} the city, Derby Place, the College's home since 1555, was {{completely}} gutted and destroyed. Fortunately the College's library was saved, and at first was stored in the Palace of Whitehall, then later moved to the Palace of Westminster, where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called the Queen's court. An announcement was also made in the London Gazette to draw public notice to the situation. Due to a shortage of funds, the planned rebuilding of a new College was delayed until 1670. It was then that Francis Sandford, the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Morris Emmett, the King's bricklayer, <b>were</b> <b>together</b> able to design and begin {{construction of a new}} structure on the old site. The costs of the rebuilding was financed in stages, and the structure was erected slowly in parts.The heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets; at the same time, they also sought subscriptions among the nobility, with the names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as the Benefactors Books.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, reports emerged {{suggesting}} My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States. Similar reports had {{circulated in}} 2003, stating that Shields, Butcher and Ó Cíosóig <b>were</b> <b>together</b> in Berlin, Germany, re-recording five songs recorded for Glider, which were due for release on an upcoming box set; and in 2007, reports suggested My Bloody Valentine {{were due to}} perform at a series of Pod-organised concerts at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, Dublin. Shields later confirmed the reunion {{and said that the}} band's third studio album, which he had begun recording in 1996, was near completion. Three live shows in the United Kingdom were announced in November 2007 and on 13 June 2008, My Bloody Valentine performed in public {{for the first time in}} 16 years during two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they <b>were</b> <b>together</b> until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked {{them as much as}} they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.|$|E
5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they <b>were</b> <b>together.</b> The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they <b>were</b> <b>together.</b> As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they <b>were</b> <b>together.</b> About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz <b>were</b> <b>together</b> at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
