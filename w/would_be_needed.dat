5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF. When the line was cut back to York Place, only 17 trams <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> An unsuccessful attempt was made in 2011 to lease ten trams to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.|$|E

The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E

According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only 1 percent <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to meet the world's current energy needs.

It may be beneficial (or necessary) to utilize chemical fixation or frozen-hydrated analysis to increase SI yields, but if the molecule is unbound and is removed or relocated during preparation, cryofixation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> necessary for accurate imaging.|$|R
25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Norway on 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe secured Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and Sola Air Station, the two land airports {{along the south}} coast of Norway. The Luftwaffe quickly assessed that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> for an additional airfield located between Kristiansand and Stavanger. Work therefore commenced on building Mandal Airfield, which was completed in August 1940.|$|R

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Stanton fell into the first-class category, as it was thought that the fort <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to defend the Washington Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at {{the airport is}} the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E

5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development. At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, {{and the need to}} carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E
5|$|Because TAPS {{hoped to}} begin laying pipe by September 1969, {{substantial}} orders were placed for steel pipeline 48inches (122cm) in diameter. No American company manufactured pipe of that specification, so three Japanese companies—Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Nippon Steel Corporation, and Nippon Kokan Kabushiki Kaisha—received a $100 million contract {{for more than}} 800 miles (1280km) of pipeline. At the same time, TAPS placed a $30 million order {{for the first of}} the enormous pumps that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to push the oil through the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to the city center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed,</b> and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with {{a limited number of}} warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open wire fence in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying public access {{to the base of the}} monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of cracks in the stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for the restoration project. Sensors recording the movement of the tower are also to be installed.|$|E

Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements.
