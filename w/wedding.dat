5|$|The <b>wedding</b> {{is deemed}} not in {{accordance}} to Hindu rituals. Banai and Khandoba marry in a simple, un-Brahmanical ceremony, where sheep droppings are showered on the couple, instead of rice as in the ritualistic weddings of classical (Brahmanical) Hinduism. The <b>wedding</b> is conducted without a Brahmin officiating priest. Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal <b>wedding)</b> and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional <b>wedding</b> band. The <b>wedding</b> is sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of the <b>wedding,</b> she is sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.|$|E

40|$|Junior-freshmen <b>weddings</b> were all-female mock <b>weddings</b> {{that were}} {{performed}} as annual traditions {{on college campuses}} throughout the U. S. {{in the early part}} of the twentieth-century. In the <b>weddings,</b> college women played both the men 2 ̆ 7 s and women 2 ̆ 7 s roles, and were joined as husband and wife by their college administration. This thesis focuses on the junior-freshman <b>weddings</b> of Florida State College for Women during the years 1909 - 1925 and argues that the <b>weddings</b> expressed the conflicted cultural contexts that college women in the Progressive Era confronted, but that, significantly, this expression was done through passing performances of gender. The women 2 ̆ 7 s choice of passing performances in the junior-freshman <b>weddings</b> allowed them to appropriate metaphors of masculinity as their own, thereby challenging a dominant gender ideology that limited their roles within society and their relationship with structures of power. In their performances of gender, play is the language they used to express this challenge. Because there were no existing scholarly studies of junior-freshmen <b>weddings,</b> it was necessary to comparatively examine analyses of other types of mock <b>weddings.</b> Through this examination it was possible to elucidate a working definition of what mock <b>weddings</b> are, which helps to understand not only junior-freshmen <b>weddings,</b> but also provides a framework from which to investigate the many other types of mock <b>weddings</b> that are as of yet unstudied...|$|R
