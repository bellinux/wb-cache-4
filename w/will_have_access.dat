So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.|$|E

25|$|According to Catholic teaching, perfect contrition, {{coupled with}} a firm {{resolution}} to sin no more, can restore a person's relationship with God, as well as God's saving grace. Under ordinary circumstances this takes place through absolution, which is received during the Sacrament of Penance. However, as God's mercy and forgiveness is not bound by the Sacrament of Penance, under extraordinary circumstances a mortal sin can be remitted through imperfect contrition, which is a human act that arises from a person's love of God. When perfect contrition is {{the means by which}} one seeks to restore one's relationship with God, there must also be a resolution to confess all mortal sins (that have not been confessed and absolved previously) in the Sacrament of Penance. A resolution to confess these sins should be made with an act of perfect contrition, {{regardless of whether or not}} a person believes that they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to the Sacrament of Penance.|$|E
