5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached <b>Western</b> <b>leaders,</b> public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

25|$|Condoleezza Rice, then United States Secretary of State, {{called upon}} African leaders {{to speak out}} against the Operation and to {{increase}} pressure on the Zimbabwean authorities to end the evictions. The African Union has rejected these calls stating it has 'more serious concerns'. For example, then South African President Thabo Mbeki questioned why <b>Western</b> <b>leaders</b> were so concerned about Zimbabwe while not paying the same amount of attention to far more dire African emergencies, such as civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.|$|E

25|$|The two monarchs, {{who ruled}} in this epoch, {{were the first}} with Western formation. King Mongkut had lived 26 years as a {{wandering}} monk and later as an abbot of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara. He was not only skilled in the traditional culture and Buddhist sciences of Siam, but he had also dealt extensively with modern western science, drawing on the knowledge of European missionaries and his correspondence with <b>Western</b> <b>leaders</b> and the Pope. He was the first Siamese monarch to speak the English language.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party had a {{progressive}} element, typified {{in the early}} 20th century by Theodore Roosevelt in the 1907–1912 period (Roosevelt was more conservative at other points), Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and <b>western</b> <b>leaders</b> such as Senator Hiram Johnson in California, Senator George W. Norris in Nebraska, Senator Bronson M. Cutting in New Mexico, Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin in Montana and Senator William Borah in Idaho. They were generally progressive in domestic policy, supported unions and supported much of the New Deal, but were isolationist in foreign policy. This element died out by the 1940s. Outside Congress, of the leaders who supported Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, most opposed the New Deal.|$|E
25|$|As Prime Minister, he {{accepted}} both the American and Chinese views that the Soviet Union was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the South Pacific. Muldoon would {{also join the}} United States President Jimmy Carter and other <b>Western</b> <b>leaders</b> in condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics. However, his government {{did not participate in}} the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union since it would hurt New Zealand's predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for handing money over to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon's government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Taylor's thesis {{was that}} Hitler {{was not the}} demoniacal figure of popular {{imagination}} but in foreign affairs a normal German leader.

Moreover, in a partial break with his view of German history advocated in The Course of German History, he argued that Hitler was not just a normal German leader but also a normal <b>Western</b> <b>leader.</b> As a normal <b>Western</b> <b>leader,</b> Hitler was no better or worse than Stresemann, Chamberlain or Daladier. His argument was that Hitler wished to make Germany the strongest power in Europe but he did not want or plan war. The outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone's part.|$|R

25|$|During a 2015 {{visit to}} King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Gabriel {{launched}} an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer Raif Badawi and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice {{in a region}} in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past. He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip. His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for <b>Western</b> <b>leaders</b> visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and Islamic State militants, particularly given Germany’s status as Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports. While the U.S. State Department had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did {{not talk about the}} case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.|$|E
25|$|During his 14 {{years as}} Prime Minister, Davíð became acquainted with, {{or a friend}} of, many <b>Western</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{including}} Bill Clinton and George W.

He has occasionally attended the meetings of the Bilderberg Group, and has read a paper to the Mont Pelerin Society. But he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for only one year. In autumn 2005, Davíð {{announced that he would}} leave politics, saying that he felt the time had come for a new generation to take over. His close ally over many years, Geir H. Haarde, replaced him, as both leader of the Independence Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs. A probable contribution to this decision was a short, but dramatic, bout of cancer, soon after the crisis over the failure of the media bill. He is in remission.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2013 elections, {{in which}} Hatnuah won six {{seats in the}} Knesset, Livni did not {{recommend}} any candidate for prime minister to President Peres. After other party leaders endorsed Netanyahu, Livni led Hatnuah in being {{the first of several}} parties to agree to join a new coalition under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, forming the thirty-third government of Israel. According to the coalition agreement negotiated between Hatnuah and Likud, Livni was appointed justice minister, as well as chief negotiator with the Palestinian Authority. As environmental issues constituted a central plank in Hatnuah's platform, Livni required her party be given the environmental protection ministry, to which she appointed Amir Peretz. Fulfilling her constitutional duty as Justice Minister, Livni served as chairwoman of the powerful Ministerial Committee on Legislation. Given her clout and experience with <b>Western</b> <b>leaders,</b> Netanyahu unofficially charged Livni with overseeing Israel's diplomatic relations with the United States and Europe, with Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman playing a lesser role.|$|E

25|$|The serious {{divisions}} between {{the western and}} eastern sections of Virginia had been simmering for decades, related to class and social differences. The western areas were growing and were based on subsistence farms by yeomen; its residents held few slaves. The planters of the eastern section were wealthy slaveholders who dominated state government. By December 1860 secession was being publicly debated throughout Virginia. Leading eastern spokesmen called for secession, while westerners warned {{they would not be}} legislated into treason. A statewide convention first met on February 13; after the attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call to arms, it voted for secession on April 17, 1861. The decision was dependent on ratification by a statewide referendum. <b>Western</b> <b>leaders</b> held mass rallies and prepared to separate, so that this area could remain in the Union. Unionists met at the Wheeling Convention with four hundred delegates from twenty-seven counties. The statewide vote in favor of secession was 132,201 to 37,451. An estimated vote on Virginia's ordinance of secession for the 50 counties that became West Virginia is 34,677 to 19,121 against secession, with 24 of the 50 counties favoring secession and 26 favoring the Union.|$|E

500|$|In the American view, Stalin {{seemed a}} {{potential}} ally in accomplishing their goals, {{whereas in the}} British approach Stalin appeared as {{the greatest threat to}} the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage and the two <b>western</b> <b>leaders</b> vied for his favors. The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the [...] "percentages agreement" [...] to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence, and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations.|$|E

Biden stated: [...] "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous.
