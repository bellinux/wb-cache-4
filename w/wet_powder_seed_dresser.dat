Fungicides indicated by barley research (carboxin + thiram, difenoconazole and triadimenol) compared with the mixture carbendazim + iprodione were tested. As <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> adjuvants, water (500 m mL/ 100 Kg) and a polymer (150 mL/ 100 Kg) were used. Treated seeds were stored in paper bags and kept in the refrigerator at 5 ºC. At 30 -day intervals during six months, seeds were plated on semi-selective Reis's medium (1983). The best control was obtained by the mixtures carboxin + thiram and carbendazim + iprodione and the polymer as <b>seed</b> <b>dresser.</b> The control efficiency was improved by the storage time without negatively affecting seed germination. Due to the transmission efficiency, the fungus eradication in seeds should be pursued...|$|R

This study showed the efficacy of the imidacloprid insecticide, Gaucho 70 WS as <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> against aphids, whiteflies and thrips incidences on CB 3 cotton cultivar. At the same time, inhabitants of the predators (ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders) and yield of the crop were evaluated. Fuzzy and delinted cotton seeds treated with imidacloprid reduced pest population compared to untreated control or foliar spray of monocrotophos 40 WSC at 1120 ml ha- 1, and being the highest efficacy at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed. Cotton plants grown with imidacloprid treated seeds have abundances of ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphids and spiders. The cotton cultivar produced significantly higher yield when seeds were treated with imidacloprid at 5. 5 g kg- 1 fuzzy seed. Therefore, use of imidacloprid, Gaucho 70 WS as a <b>seed</b> <b>dresser</b> may be an option for controlling sucking pests of cotton under field conditions...|$|R

This study {{is a continuation of}} previous work on oil extraction from flaxseed to produce biodiesel; herein, the residue cake from flaxseed was studied. Three different types of samples (<b>powdered</b> <b>seeds,</b> de-oiled cake, and in situ transesterified cake of flaxseed) were torrefied (through slow pyrolysis), and the sample properties were characterized. The higher heating value (HHV= 36. 01 ± 0. 36  MJ[*]kg− 1) and bulk density (0. 33 ± 0. 01  g[*]cm− 3) of the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> are higher compared to the other two samples (i. e. de-oiled cake and in situ transesterified cake). The torrefied biomass was light weight losing its mechanical strength on treatment, making it easier to grind. It was observed that the biomass torrefied at 300 [*]°C had a higher fraction of particles between sieve sizes (between 2. 0 and 0. 063  mm) compared to the biomass torrefied at 200 [*]°C. The sieve sizes between 0. 5 and 0. 063  mm showed that more particles of the torrefied biomass treated at 300 [*]°C were collected compared to that torrefied at 200 [*]°C. Due to the loss of hydrogen and oxygen content and the removal of water, the carbon content in the torrefied biomass increased by 25. 52, 24. 51, and 22. 69 [*]% for the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds,</b> de-oiled cake, and in situ cake samples, respectively. The <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> had a higher carbon and hydrogen content compared to the de-oiled and in situ transesterified flaxseed cakes because the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> contained fatty acids. The <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> had a higher concentration of CO 2 gas liberated during treatment compared to the de-oiled and in situ transesterified cakes. This was attributed to the <b>powdered</b> <b>seeds</b> having a higher concentration of volatile hydrocarbons and a lower ash content.

The <b>powdered</b> <b>seed</b> of Jatropha curcasdosages also showed a significant reduction in worm number when compared to the infected control.
