25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} scene of the episode, when Jon Snow arises from the table, Weiss stated that [...] "Jon coming back to life was {{something}} in the first, first version we wrote originally had more talking. And as we saw it on the page written out, we realized it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> dialogue, we decided to just give the kind of awe of that moment its due." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to {{find someone}} who could sing backup vocals. Evans {{described}} disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, [...] "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a nice guy." [...] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.|$|E

5000|$|Wisconsin was won by {{a narrow}} margin by Gore by some 5,000 votes. Gore {{carrying}} Milwaukee County home of Milwaukee, and Dane County home of Madison <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Bush to overcome.|$|R
50|$|Bobby Hull and the Chicago Black Hawks <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the Rangers and the Black Hawks {{advanced}} to the finals in seven games. Hull won two games with goals on face-offs, despite Glen Sather's coverage of him to check him.|$|R
500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E
500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> We {{were on the road}} all the time and I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
2500|$|When Connery {{received}} the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 June 2006, he confirmed his retirement from acting. On 7 June 2007, he denied rumours {{that he would}} appear in the fourth Indiana Jones film, stating that [...] "retirement <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> damned fun".|$|R

5000|$|The piano {{is played}} by long-time Bowie pianist Mike Garson in a sombre form that led David Buckley to make an analogy with the [...] "psychotic menage" [...] of Bowie's Outside (1995), {{although}} the biographer concludes: [...] "Bowie's vocal, quivering and unstable, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> As music writer Alex Petridis put it, the song was sadly 'overcooked'." ...|$|R
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste wrote: [...] "As {{great as}} {{an episode of}} Bob's Burgers can be when {{the kids and the}} adults are given their own {{separate}} stories... there's something much more rewarding about a storyline that combines the two groups in an almost Simpson-ian manner." [...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun. I hope he comes back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pakistan started badly, {{falling to}} 3/38. Imran Khan (58 from 84 balls, 4 fours) and Javed Miandad (70 from 103 balls, 4 fours) shared a {{partnership}} of 112 runs in 26 overs. However, with the required run rate at 7.87 runs when Miandad fell, there <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{for the upcoming}} batsmen to do, and Pakistan lost 6/99 as they were bowled all out for 249 (all out, 49 overs) ...|$|E
2500|$|Many riders {{dropped out}} of the race after {{completing}} the initial stages as the physical effort the tour required <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Only a mere 24 entrants remained {{at the end of the}} fourth stage. The race finished on the edge of Paris at Ville d'Avray, outside the Restaurant du Père Auto, before a ceremonial ride into Paris and several laps of the Parc des Princes. [...] Garin dominated the race, winning the first and last two stages, at 25.68km/h. The last rider, Millocheau, finished 64h 47m 22s behind him.|$|E
50|$|York {{went back}} to Detroit to stay in 1937. Since {{there was no room}} for a rookie first baseman on a team that already had Hank Greenberg, York started the season at third base but his {{defensive}} liabilities <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to overlook. After a brief try in left field, he was benched in favor of more experienced outfielders.|$|R
5000|$|The Woolly Bugger is so effective, {{it should}} be banned from some watersheds. I suspect its {{effectiveness}} is due to its resemblance to so many edible creatures in the water--nymphs, leeches, salamanders, or even small sculpins. Its tail undulating behind a fiber, bubble-filled body <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for most fish to resist. It just looks like a meal! Bill Hunter ...|$|R
5000|$|In the seventh-season finale [...] "Send in the Clones," [...] Steve {{created a}} cloning machine {{and wound up}} cloning himself. Myra was {{initially}} excited, but eventually realized that two Steves <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> To clear up the situation, Laura proposed {{that one of the}} Steves be permanently turned into Stefan, so that she and Myra can both be with the one they love.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 September 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that Dan Paris had reprised {{his role as}} Drew Kirk for the series. Paris was reunited with his former co-stars Alan Fletcher and Jackie Woodburne who played Drew's in-laws Karl and Susan Kennedy. Of his return, Paris commented [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun to pass up and it was great to see Alan and Jackie again, it was as if no time had passed – not unlike how a zombie feels I guess." [...] On 15 October, it was announced that actors Ben Nicholas, Kevin Harrington and Aaron Jakubenko would reprise their roles as Stingray Timmins, David Bishop and Robbo Slade respectively. Many current cast members appear in the series including, Fletcher, Woodburne, Ryan Moloney (Toadfish Rebecchi), Josef Brown (Matt Turner), Jenna Rosenow (Amber Turner), Eve Morey (Sonya Mitchell), Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson) and Calen Mackenzie (Bailey Turner). The five-part series made its debut on the Neighbours YouTube channel on 27 October.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to stand there singing this song that does my head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{studio is}} crammed with equipment, but I ended up feeling I was being {{overcome}} by it all—it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> I {{used to go}} to bed every night thinking 'Tomorrow, I'm going to write the tune. Tomorrow {{is going to be the}} day', but nothing ever happened. Eventually Neil McLellan pointed out that we'd been in the studio for four months without having anything to show for it. [...] Nat [...] was doing her own record so we weren't spending a lot of time together , but [...] there were always dogs to stroke and videos to watch and gardens to walk 'round, so I didn't ever feel like I was at work—I was too laid-back. [...] Neil [...] said we had to get out, get back to London. I knew I physically couldn't sit in my room any more, and for the first time in my life I listened to someone else and realised I actually needed help. It wasn't [...] that I needed help with the writing, just that I needed help finding the right headspace to get into the right frame of mind. I wanted to write a good album— one I was happy with—but to do that I knew I'd have to jerk myself out of [...] situation I was in and start again.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, Martha {{accepted}} {{a position in}} the National Security Resources Board, which would mobilize resources {{in the event of a}} Soviet attack. She resigned as President Dwight Eisenhower was inaugurated, and moved back to New York. By then, her marriage with Waitstill had degraded, and the two mutually separated, believing the hardships they'd gone through during World War II <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> She eventually remarried, and took the name Cogan.|$|R
5000|$|Concision It's easy to {{make the}} {{interface}} clear by over-clarifying and labeling everything, but this leads to interface bloat, where there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> stuff on the screen at the same time. If too many things are on the screen, finding what you're looking for is difficult, and so the interface becomes tedious to use. The real challenge in making a great interface {{is to make it}} concise and clear at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|We Catholics {{generally}} {{believe that}} there is a hell. I hope nobody is there. I certainly believe in a place of purification. I think it will be like getting up in the morning and you throw the curtains back and the light <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> God's light would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for us. But I believe on behalf of the innocent victims in history that the scales of justice should work out. And if they don't, life is radically unjust, the law of the jungle prevails.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , and it made me sick. It really grossed me out and I remember people got up and left, walked out of the theatre and I was just thinking, 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.' It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> I thought. And when the film came out, it wasn't in the film." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another reason {{given for}} these {{failures}} {{was that it}} was too far ahead of the buying habits of the public. One quote from journal Automation in Marketing said that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for the average mind to grasp; too far in advance of the public thinking. Saunders received posthumously the 1958 [...] for the Keedoozle technology concept.|$|E
5000|$|Dana Blankenhorn of ZDNet {{called the}} book [...] "a sort of open source novel" [...] {{as a way}} of {{describing}} how Eric Flint invited other authors to contribute stories to this book in which it extends the franchise.

40|$|Very few (if any) {{people believe}} {{that the world was}} created, and is maintained, by a {{thoroughly}} contemptible and malicious being. Do we have good reason for our disbelief? In {{the first part of this}} paper I offer an argument for the non-existence of such a being. According to this argument there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> good - <b>too</b> may good things - in the world for the ‘malicious being’ theory to be plausible.

5000|$|On July 14, 2011, Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) {{placed a}} ban on [...] "On Rainy Days" [...] because it “contained content that’s harmful to youth”.

In response to the ban, member Yang Yoseob posted on his Twitter, “I think I’m going to start singing children songs.

50|$|Those {{who could}} move did {{and those with}} fewer options remained. Some moved to other {{sections}} of the City yet remained connected to the parish while others simply disappeared.

50|$|Coover's fiction {{maintains}} that the world cannot be objectively understood and that there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to sort through—all the people in on world social security assigning too many people to one bed. In {{the face of an}} overwhelming amount of data people take another route: myth. Myth has the ring and feel of truth, but rational thought and objective analysis are not needed to put it into place and allow it to function. By accepting myths, people put themselves {{in a position where they}} feel as if they can go on with life and they have a place of stability from which to operate.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{findings}} from health research is the failure to routinely translate research evidence into daily practice. Studies simply can't guarantee the use of their findings. There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> research to keep track of and so a large gap develops between what is known and what is done. Evidence that should change practice is often ignored for years. The literature is constantly changing and when an answer to a clinical question is sought, it often comes from an out-of-date textbook. Remaining knowledgeable of current, relevant research is difficult. Consequently, the development of skills in searching electronic databases is vital for the up-to-date clinician...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{give credit}} to TheatreWorks, Mr. Lippa, Mr. Crawley and {{director}} Susan H. Schulman for working toward making this old-fashioned family musical work wend its way to Broadway. However, the show needs to flow more smoothly and the characters need to be defined more sharply. There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> going on, with too little focus on the central characters. It's not a sophisticated musical, but there are saving graces in this production's singing, exuberant athletic dancing, melodic score and good production values. However, something is lacking {{to make it a}} great musical. Two liabilities are the indigestible book and two stories presented side by side." ...|$|R
