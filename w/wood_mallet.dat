40|$|Within {{the sport}} of cricket it is common {{practice}} for players to tap the blade of a bat with a hard <b>wood</b> <b>mallet</b> or cricket ball to gauge its potential playing performance. This subjective assessment can produce contradictory opinions on the same bat. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reliability of the ‘tapping’ test in rating the potential performance of cricket bats. This was done by comparing a measurable performance indicator (apparent coefficient of restitution, ACoR) to player assessment. Twenty experienced amateur and semi-pro cricketers completed a scaled-response questionnaire to describe the sound and feel of impact during the ‘tapping’ test, and rate the predicted performance. Correlations between player responses and ACoR were explored. Predicted bat performance by three out of twenty participants showed correlation with ACoR. It was concluded that the tapping test is not a reliable measure of bat performance across the study population. There are indications that individuals can correctly differentiate bats, but there is clear evidence that they also make errors. A further study with a larger number of participants and an exploration of the relative influence of sensory response will yield further insights to this pilot study...|$|E
5000|$|The huiringua, kuiringua, kiringua, [...] quiringua, cuiringua is a {{percussion}} {{instrument of}} the group of slit drums. It consists of a hollow log with closed ends with a slit along the instrument.The shell becomes the resonating chamber for the sound vibrations created when the slit is struck with a pair of <b>wood</b> <b>mallets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Teponaztli {{are made}} of hollow {{hardwood}} logs, often fire-hardened. Like most slit drums, teponaztlis have two slits on their topside, cut {{into the shape of}} an [...] "H". The resultant strips or tongues are then struck with rubber-head <b>wood</b> <b>mallets,</b> or with deer antlers. [...] Since the tongues are of different lengths, or carved into different thicknesses, the teponaztli produces 2 different pitches, usually near a third or fourth apart.|$|R
50|$|Common tools {{used for}} {{planishing}} include panel beating hammers, slappers, and neck hammers. Heavy rawhide or hardwood hammers are often used. It {{is more difficult}} to make mistakes with heavy rawhide or <b>wood</b> <b>mallets,</b> but they are less effective for large imperfections. A worker, using repeated, relatively soft glancing blows, smooths the metal toward the curvature of the stake. If the metal begins to look dimpled, the worker is using too much force in individual hammer blows.|$|R

50|$|Black ash {{is unique}} among all trees in North America {{in that it}} does not have fibers {{connecting}} the growth rings to each other. This is a useful property for basket makers. By pounding on the <b>wood</b> with a <b>mallet,</b> the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in long strips. The long strips are trimmed, cleaned, and used in basket weaving. Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands also make bark baskets from black ash, traditionally used for berry-gathering.|$|R
5000|$|The Jughandle Creek trestle {{collapsed}} in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was rebuilt. The first Mallet locomotive in the Redwood Empire was delivered in 1910. Like the others, it was assembled in Caspar after arriving in pieces on ships. Wyes were constructed at Caspar and at Camp 1 to turn this large locomotive. Locomotives had previously burned <b>wood,</b> but <b>Mallet</b> number 5 had the capability to burn oil, and locomotives 2, 3 and 4 and the steam donkeys were shortly converted to burn oil. [...] A January, 1914, storm caused a landslide closing the tunnel. The sawmill was closed until the tunnel was reopened that summer. [...] Locomotive number 1 was retired in 1914. Shay locomotive number 6 was purchased to work on an isolated branch line on Three Chop Ridge connected to {{the remainder of the}} railway by an inclined tramway. Locomotives 2, 3 and 4 worked on branches out of Camp 1 while Mallet locomotive number 5 pulled trainloads of logs from Camp 1 to the mill at Caspar. On 19 April 1923 locomotive number 5 derailed and wrecked after hitting runaway horses on Digger Creek trestle. Locomotives 2 and 4 were damaged when the Camp 1 engine house burned two months later. [...] The railroad had grown to a length of 30 miles when the last locomotive (Mallet number 7) was delivered in 1924.|$|R
5000|$|Logs are {{typically}} cut into appropriate lengths using a chainsaw, then the [...] "ringers" [...] or cuts are split with an axe into cubes which are {{small enough to}} handle, usually 100 to 450 pounds, then stacked on a rope. The rope is looped around the stacked wood and the ends passed through an eye spliced in the end. When the running end is pulled it tightens the [...] "sling" [...] rope around the blocks preventing them from falling out. The slings are then flown to a central location {{where they can be}} loaded on pallets for transport. Previously, swede saws, crosscut saws and hand saws may have been used to cut the logs, and a froe (a heavy blade 24 inches long and three inches wide with a handle at one end perpendicular to the blade) was used to split the ringers. This blade was driven into the <b>wood</b> using a <b>mallet,</b> then the <b>wood</b> could be pried apart by pulling on the handle if it would not split by driving the blade in alone.|$|R

60|$|The {{very day}} after my arrival in this place, I was so {{fortunate}} as to shoot another adult male {{of the small}} Orang, the Mias-kassir of the Dyaks. It fell when dead, but caught in a fork of the tree and remained fixed. As I was very anxious to get it, I tried to persuade two young Dyaks who were with me to cut down the tree, which was tall, perfectly straight and smooth-barked, and without a branch for fifty or sixty feet. To my surprise, {{they said they would}} prefer climbing up it, {{but it would be a}} good deal of trouble, and, after a little talking together, they said they would try. They first went to a clump of bamboo that stood near, and cut down one of the largest stems. From this they chopped off a short piece, and splitting it, made a couple of stout pegs, about a foot long and sharp at one end. Then cutting a thick piece of <b>wood</b> for a <b>mallet,</b> they drove one of the pegs into the tree and hung their weight upon it. It held, and this seemed to satisfy them, for they immediately began making a quantity of pegs of the same kind, while I looked on with great interest, wondering how they could possibly ascend such a lofty tree by merely driving pegs in it, the failure of any one of which at a good height would certainly cause their death. When about two dozen pegs were made, one of them began cutting some very long and slender bamboo from another clump, and also prepared some cord from the bark of a small tree. They now drove in a peg very firmly at about three feet from the ground, and bringing one of the long bamboos, stood it upright close to the tree, and bound it firmly to the two first pegs, by means of the bark cord and small notches near the head of each peg. One of the Dyaks now stood on the first peg and drove in a third, about level with his face, to which he tied the bamboo in the same way, and then mounted another step, standing on one foot, and holding by the bamboo at the peg immediately above him, while he drove in the next one. In this manner he ascended about twenty feet; when the upright bamboo was becoming thin, another was handed up by his companion, and this was joined by tying both bamboos to three or four of the pegs. When this was also nearly ended, a third was added, and shortly after, the lowest branches of the tree were reached, along which the young Dyak scrambled, and soon sent the Mias tumbling down headlong. I was exceedingly struck by the ingenuity of this mode of climbing, and the admirable manner in which the peculiar properties of the bamboo were made available. The ladder itself was perfectly safe, since if any one peg were loose or faulty, and gave way, the strain would be thrown on several others above and below it. I now understood the use of the line of bamboo pegs sticking in trees, which I had often seen, and wondered for what purpose they could have been put there. This animal was almost identical in size and appearance with the one I had obtained at Semabang, and was the only other male specimen of the Simia morio which I obtained. It is now in the Derby Museum.|$|R
