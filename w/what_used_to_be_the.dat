5|$|The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, a transcontinental auto trail {{extending}} from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, {{was established in}} 1919. In eastern New York, the highway went through Keeseville, Ausable Chasm, and Fort Kent along <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike before entering Vermont {{by way of the}} Burlington–Port Kent Ferry across Lake Champlain.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} had two main entrances: a main entrance {{at ground level}} that faced east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat check was an evocative quote from Dante Alighieri Divine Comedy. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.|$|E
5|$|The tourist {{information}} centre {{is situated in}} the Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery in <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> old Music Hall theatre in the town square.

5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic in 1994, creating a link in the trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built in <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Standard Mill, while the North Star Lofts was a new use for the former North Star Woolen Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main {{and a number of}} condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E
5|$|Because Stretford is {{situated}} on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site of <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Bass Drum public house, {{was one of the}} main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, about the time that horse-drawn omnibuses arrived, in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10minutes between 8:00am and 10:15pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Sir Iain Colquhoun {{sold the}} castle to Mrs. H. Macaulay-Stromberg, a wealthy American, who {{restored}} the castle and lived there until her death, in 1931.

25|$|The dynasty’s {{original}} home was the Toungoo region, with the capital at Toungoo. But from 1539 onward, the High King, styled as “King of Kings”, moved {{the capital to}} Pegu (Bago), and governed only <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Hanthawaddy Kingdom. This {{was the first time}} in Burmese history that a capital, which had the authority over the entire Irrawaddy basin, was located near the coast. The Toungoo kings retained the traditional three-province structure of the old Hanthawaddy Kingdom; Bayinnaung later annexed the Siamese Province of Mergui into the core administration for its maritime revenues.|$|E

The Docklands Light Railway was extended in 1994 to serve {{much of the}} royal docks area when the Beckton branch was opened. The Isle of Dogs branch was further extended south and in 1999 it then served Greenwich Town Centre, including the Cutty Sark museum, Deptford and finally Lewisham. In 2005, a new branch of the DLR opened from Canning Town to serve <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> eastern terminus of the North London Line, including a station at London City Airport.

25|$|Kew Gardens Hills {{is a mixed}} {{neighborhood}} of single-family homes– detached or in rows– as well as three to six-story garden apartment buildings mostly built during the years immediately following World War II, such as Regency Gardens. These apartments are characterized by their lawns and internal pathways that give the complexes a small-neighborhood feel. There are several homes in Kew Gardens Hills that predate Main Street, whose property was subject to eminent domain in the 1930s to widen 144th Street into the Main Street extension from northern Flushing. A few public housing projects {{in one part of}} the neighborhood were also built. Other buildings in that area were built to house employees of certain unions, including the Electchester Co-operative Building, built for electrical employees in 1949 on <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> grounds of the Pomonok Country Club, which no longer houses electrical employees exclusively.|$|E
25|$|The current Church now {{occupies}} <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{choir and}} the sanctuary areas. This {{is separated from}} the open court by a solid red brick wall, of Middle Ages construction with doors and windows. The original sanctuary was built in a trefoil style with three apses. It is a step higher than the nave in the open court. The rectangular space defined by the apses to its north, south, and east sides; used {{to serve as the}} altar for the greater basilica. Now the altar is located within the central or eastern apse. The rest of the space is now integrated into the nave of the current Church. There is also a new iconstasis made with solid wood and adorned by small icons on its top register. The current sanctuary in the central apse is actually divided into three. The middle one is dedicated to Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, the southern one to the Virgin Mary, and the northern one to Saint George.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 1800, Captain Lhéritier fought at {{the decisive}} Battle of Marengo, where he {{collected}} a severe thigh wound. Six {{weeks after the}} battle, on 28 July 1800, he was transferred from the General Staff to the Cavalry branch {{of the army and}} was attached to the 6th Dragoons. Completely healed from his injury on 23 October of that year, he was detached from his regiment and, from November reassumed staff duties, as aide-de-camp to General Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière. However, he soon moved back to cavalry, as, on 19 September 1801 he was promoted to Squadron Commander in the 9th Cavalry. Following the various reforms of the cavalry branch during this period of peace, Lhéritier was again commissioned aide-de-camp on 16 December 1801, a position that he held until 26 August 1803, when he was decommissioned. He resumed service a few months later, on 13 October 1803 and on 15 December of that year, he was given a position in the 11th Cuirassiers, a regiment that had been created in 1803 from <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> 11th Cavalry.|$|E

25|$|With {{the favor}} of the Tokugawa the temple prospered but, {{at least in the}} first years since foundation, it was just the Tokugawa family temple, while the sole funeral temple of the Tokugawa was still Zōjō-ji, where the second shogun Hidetada rests. His {{successor}} Iemitsu sent his remains to Nikko because the Nikkō Tōshō-gū, mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the dynasty, was there; he however also built a mausoleum at Kan'ei'ji. After that, the fourth shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna and the fifth Tokugawa Tsunayoshi were put to rest in Ueno, and Kan'ei-ji became a Tokugawa funeral temple like Zōjō-ji. Zōjō-ji didn't like the change but, after the next shogun Tokugawa Ienobu's mausoleum was built on its land, the custom became to alternate the temples at each generation, and that lasted until the closing of the shogunate era. Excepted Ieyasu and Iemitsu (buried in Nikko) and last shogun Yoshinobu (also known as Keiki, buried in nearby Yanaka Cemetery), all of the Tokugawa shoguns are buried either at Zōjō-ji or Kan'ei-ji, six at one and six at the other. In <b>what</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Kan'ei-ji cemetery near the Tokyo National Museum are interred Tokugawa Ietsuna, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Tokugawa Yoshimune, Tokugawa Ieharu, Tokugawa Ienari, Tokugawa Iesada and Iesada's wife Tenshoin.
