The mosque is built with mud and reeds, and measures about [...] by [...] It has two towers in pyramidal shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on {{the east and the}} other as a minaret in the northeast corner. In addition, 12 buttresses of conical shape on the external walls are strengthened by horizontally-aligned timber elements. The architectural style is also known as [...] "flat-footed adobe architecture".

2500|$|One of {{the most}} popular rides today is Lagoon's famous wooden roller coaster. Designed by John Miller of Coney Island fame; it was {{constructed}} in 1921. Miller gave Lagoon's coaster plenty of dips and turns. Its highest height is fifty-seven feet, and the length of track is two thousand five hundred feet. The ride lasts just under two minutes and the coaster train reaches speeds up to 45mph (72km/h). It is locally known as the [...] "White Roller Coaster" [...] due to its <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> paint. Little, if any, of the Roller Coaster is still white, however, since as wooden supports are regularly replaced, the new supports are left unpainted.|$|E
2500|$|Restoration {{continues}} on the brew house, {{the centerpiece of}} the complex. [...] Silver Ventures recently wrapped up 18 months of restoration on the building's exterior. [...] Today, the outside looks much like it did in 1894, especially with the return of the San Antonio Brewing Association company name back to the building plaque. [...] The golden cupolas and <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> are gone from the building, instead the rooftops are charcoal, their original color, and the walls have been stripped down to show their natural stone. [...] The brew house project is far from complete, though, with work remaining on the middle and rear of the building, as well as the entire interior.|$|E
2500|$|On October 31, 2000 the University of Pennsylvania Museum and Yale University Expedition to Abydos, Egypt {{issued a}} press release in which they {{described}} {{the discovery of the}} royal solar boats at Abydos. [...] At a site a mile distant from the royal tombs, lines of mud brick uncovered by blowing sand were first noticed in 1988. [...] Although the Abydos boats are not the oldest boat remains to be discovered in Egypt, nor are they the world's first boats as is sometimes proclaimed, they are extremely important to the history of boat design and nautical architecture. Understandably, these brick remains at Abydos were first thought to be walls. In 1991, an important clarification was made. A research consensus decided these bricks were remnants of ancient walls after all, but not in the usual sense. They were actually the boundaries for more than a dozen ship burials from an early dynasty. Each ship grave had its own brick boundary walls. The outline of each grave was {{in the shape of a}} boat, and the surface of each was covered with mud plaster and <b>white</b> <b>wash.</b> Small boulders at the prow or stern of each grave represented anchors. Because of the fragility of the boat remains, almost no excavation was done initially as the situation had to be carefully studied for future conservation.|$|E

The swell looked higher than it had appeared from the yacht, and as he heard it tumbling among the stones he wondered how they were to land. Besides, {{it was difficult to}} keep the lurching craft on a straight course. He stopped sculling when a weedy ledge of rock with a <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> running over it appeared in the gloom.|$|E

60|$|When {{the moon}} shone through {{he could see}} her plunge over the steep swell and the <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> at the lighters' bows as they {{followed}} in her wake; then as a cloud drove past, their dark hulls faded and left nothing but a row of tossing lights. By and by the launch reached a bend in the coastline and the breeze freshened and drew more ahead. The swell began to break and showers of spray blew on board, while the sea got white off-shore.|$|E
60|$|The launch was hove {{down on her}} side. Though {{the screw}} thudded furiously, she seemed to gain no ground, and then the strain on the hawser {{suddenly}} slackened. Dick wondered whether it had broken, but he would know {{in the next few}} seconds; there was a sharp jerk, the launch was dragged to leeward, but recovered and forged ahead. She plunged her bows into a broken swell and the spray filled Dick's eyes, but when he could see again the foam was sliding past and a gap widened between the lighter's hull and the <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> on the rock.|$|E
60|$|The dim shape {{had grown}} clearer while he spoke, and {{a strip of}} {{something}} black appeared between the smoke cloud and the piled‐up froth. Then a slender whip of mast stood out against the sky, and from the crown of the after funnel there poured another gush of flame. The craft was almost level with them now, but {{it was evident that}} in another minute or two she would have passed and be fading again, and Appleby felt his heart throb painfully as he watched her. Then the <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> about her seemed to swirl higher, funnels and mast slanted sharply, and the half‐ seen hull shortened. Appleby looked at Harper, who made a little gesture of resignation.|$|E

60|$|Then {{she saw the}} <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> of the Cumbria's {{propeller}} as it whirled astern, {{and there}} was a roar of running chain, while two or three minutes later they were making their way up the lowered ladder amidst a crowd of petty dealers when Jefferson came across the deck, driving the latter aside. Jacinta saw that it cost Muriel an effort to hide her consternation at his appearance, but in another moment she was smiling at him with shining eyes, and the haggard man's arms were about her. That the deck was crowded with Spaniards did not seem in the least to matter to either of them. Jacinta, who would not have done as much, felt a little thrill of sympathy, and, it was significant, looked round for Austin. There was, however, no sign of him.|$|E
60|$|There were dim black {{trees and}} shadowy rocks close {{in front of}} him, with a <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> about the latter, for a smooth swell worked in around a point from open water. He could hear the rumble of the surf upon the reefs, and though he could {{scarcely}} feel a breath of wind upon his face the wailing of the black pines suggested that it was blowing still. He could smell the clean resinous scent of them {{and it seemed to}} him that they were singing wild, barbaric songs. Afterward, when he knew them better, he learned that the pines and their kin, the cedars and balsams and redwoods, are never silent altogether. Even when their fragrance steals out heavy and sweet as honey under the fierce sunshine of a windless day, one can hear faint elfin whisperings high up among their somber spires. Then he saw that Jake was standing on the side deck, apparently gazing at the white surf about the end of the point.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, Charly's {{deductions}} {{had been}} proved correct, {{for when the}} breeze freshened Dampier climbed into the shrouds. He had noticed the ominous blackness to windward, and knew what it meant, which was why he had hauled a reef in the schooner's mainsail down, and now kept her out a little from the ice. As the light faded he found {{it very difficult to}} see the boat against the <b>white</b> <b>wash</b> of the seas that recoiled from the ice, but when the snow was whirling about him he decided that she was in some peril unless her crew could pull her round the point. It was evident {{that this would be a}} difficult matter, though he had only an occasional glimpse of her now. He waved an arm to the helmsman, who understood that he was to run the schooner in; there was a rattle of blocks as the booms swung out, and as the Selache sped away before the rapidly freshening breeze it seemed to Dampier that he saw the boat hurled upon the ice. Then a blinding haze of snow shut out everything, and he came down with a run.|$|E

There was a rattle of blocks as the booms swung out, and as the Selache sped away before the rapidly freshening breeze it seemed to Dampier that he saw the boat hurled upon the ice. A blinding haze of snow suddenly shut out everything, and the skipper hastened down to the deck. He stood beside the wheel for several minutes. Gazing forward, he could see nothing except the filmy whiteness and the tops of the seas that had steadily been getting steeper. The schooner was driving furiously down upon the ice, but it was evident that to send Wyllard any assistance was utterly beyond his power. He could have hove to the schooner while he got the bigger boat over, and two men might have pulled towards the ice with the breeze astern of them, but it was perfectly clear that they could have neither made a landing nor have pulled her back again. It was also uncertain whether he and the other man could have brought the schooner round or have gotten more sail off her. He stood still until they heard the wash of the sea upon the ice close to lee of them, and then it was a hard-clenched hand he raised in sign to the helmsman.|$|E
60|$|The dwelling-houses, and {{contiguous}} outhouses, are, in many instances, of {{the colour}} {{of the native}} rock, out of {{which they have been}} built; but, frequently the Dwelling or Fire-house, as it is ordinarily called, has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough-cast and <b>white</b> <b>wash,</b> which, as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it, in a few years acquires, by the influence of weather, a tint at once sober and variegated. As these houses have been, from father to son, inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances, they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy: so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of Nature, and may (using a strong expression) rather be said to have grown than to have been erected;--to have risen, by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock--so little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty. Among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs, are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance, that the strong winds, which sweep down the vallies, induced the inhabitants, {{at a time when the}} materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence, are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds. Nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney. Others are of a quadrangular shape, rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form, and the living column of smoke, ascending from it through the still air. These dwellings, mostly built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with slates, which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood, and are, therefore, rough and uneven in their surface, so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their very form call to mind the processes of Nature, do thus, clothed in part with a vegetable garb, appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of Nature and simplicity, along which the humble-minded inhabitants have, through so many generations, been led. Add the little garden with its shed for bee-hives, its small bed of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-press, often supported by some tree near the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall fir, through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless; the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons;--combine these incidents and images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain-cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself, and so richly adorned by the hand of Nature.|$|E
