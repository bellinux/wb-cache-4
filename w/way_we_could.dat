25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> operate, because we were so small. For us it was not a question of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did {{to be found in the}} Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the game stems {{primarily from the}} graphic {{manner in which the}} player executes enemies. In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. We all knew there was no <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1997 was {{the least}} {{successful}} season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking back now, it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just feels like it keeps going." ...|$|E

Once {{we were out of}} Vietnam the only <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

500|$|While Amusement Vision was {{responsible}} for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD employees Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo {{was responsible}} for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned [...] "If Nintendo planned to hold our hands through development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> focus on a project which would reflect our studio's abilities. I figured that would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us." [...] Miyamoto thought the collaboration resulted in a [...] "true evolution of the F-Zero series", enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the [...] "F-Zero world on a grand scale." [...] Published by Nintendo, F-Zero GX was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, 2003, and in PAL regions on October 31, 2003. The Arcade version was released in 2003 alongside its Gamecube counterpart.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of [...] and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers' 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good {{foundation on which}} to base [...] "a new chapter" [...] in the Pirates series. Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but whenever you say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E

The article quoted city police chief Keith Sadler as saying, [...] "Years ago, there's no <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do this... It brings to mind Big Brother, George Orwell and 1984.

Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a feedback loop.

When we heard the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and it's taken us {{a while to get}} that.

2500|$|What {{was from}} a spectator's {{perspective}} a remarkable series—a closely fought 1-0 victory by lowly New Zealand against the then unofficial cricket world champions—was marred by acrimony and complaints from the teams involved. [...] The West Indies maintained their bitterness towards the umpiring after the series, with Rodriguez complaining that the umpiring had not been biased so much as incompetent and that the West Indies had been [...] "set up; {{that there was no}} <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> win a Test." [...] Lloyd later conceded, however, that he should have taken a firmer line with his players and that some of the incidents had not been {{in the best interests of}} the game. [...] New Zealand's Goodall, however—the principal target of the West Indies' anger—compounded the bitterness by allegedly making racist comments about the West Indies at an after-dinner speech following the series.|$|E

2500|$|Milošević was {{uninterested in}} {{maintaining}} Slovenia within the Yugoslav federation, as Slovenia had very few Serbs living within it and Milošević suggested a political deal with Slovenian president Kučan, Serbia would recognize {{the right of}} the self-determination of the Slovene nation to independence if Slovenia in turn recognized the right of self-determination of the Serb nation to remain united with Serbia. Such a deal would have set a precedent for Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia to remain in one state with Serbia. Milošević's ally in the Yugoslav federal government, Borisav Jović stated [...] "I put it bluntly. We didn't want a war with Slovenia. Serbia had no territorial claims there. It was an ethnically-pure republic – no Serbs. We couldn't care less if they left Yugoslavia... We would have been overstretched. With Slovenia out of the <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> dictate terms to the Croats." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boyd {{described}} the album as having [...] "a very a particularly warm musical tone to it. It steps further out from anything we've ever done." [...] Boyd {{also noted that}} the sound on the new record is the culmination of a long search for a new sound and direction for the band; [...] "I do believe that for many years now we have been searching for something different. Something unique, both to the world and to us as a band. We decided that If Not Now, When?, our seventh full length studio album, would be just that." [...] Prior to the album's release, bassist Ben Kenney discussed the writing process in relation to fan expectations, stating [...] "from my perspective, we only write music to satisfy ourselves. We love to play and we’ve been fortunate to have people follow us and have really great and successful records. But, for the most part it’s to entertain each other and write music that we like to play." [...] Discussing the band's stylistic change, Kenney noted, [...] "There’s no <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have written this record a few years ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout shooting, Arri Alexa {{cameras were}} used; an Alexa M {{was used for}} {{handheld}} sequences, and an Alexa XT {{was attached to the}} Steadicam. Neither used matteboxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: [...] "We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face." [...] Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki {{went so far as to}} say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes. Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying [...] "You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the [...] "intimacy" [...] he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a puzzle}} about philosophical beliefs. Core philosophical beliefs that are widely shared among philosophers, {{such as the}} belief that skepticism is false, are often held with extreme confidence. However, this confidence is not justified if these beliefs are based on what are traditionally seen as the sources of philosophical evidence, such as intuitions or observation (or reasoning on these bases). Charity requires that we should look for some other basis for these beliefs. I argue that these beliefs are based on our knowledge of what we find interesting. Further, I argue {{that this is a}} good basis for belief. Knowing what we find interesting allows us to tune our inquiry in <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not otherwise...|$|R
