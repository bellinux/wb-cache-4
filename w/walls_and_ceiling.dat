5|$|The {{interior}} <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of {{the hall}} were richly decorated, in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the Pantheons, religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling,</b> of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the interiors of the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} were {{decorated with}} <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> paintings that, in many cases, covered the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceilings</b> entirely, <b>and</b> with elaborately carved wooden Torah arks.|$|R

5|$|The Danebod Lutheran Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling,</b> porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} flooring was Venetian marble; it {{was replaced}} with a speckled maroon and black terrazzo floor {{as part of the}} renovations made in 1986; the church's <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> were painted mauve, pink, and alabaster. The original reredos (high altar) has been removed, but the sanctuary still contains religious artifacts, paintings, sculptures, stained glass windows, and other works of art.|$|E

Reflecting a typical 1930s interior treatment, the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceilings</b> of the living room, main bedroom {{and parts of the}} smaller bedrooms to the east are lined with battened fibrous cement sheeting. A simple arch springing from tapered narrow posts divides the living room. These rooms have doors and architraves typical of the 1930s. Dividing partitions and linings in the sunroom and the fitout to the kitchen and bathrooms are recent. Other <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceilings</b> are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. Floors are carpeted throughout except for tiles to bathrooms, kitchen and laundry.|$|R
25|$|The <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of {{the church}} were built from stone and white mortar. The stones of which Saint John the Baptist was built were brought from nearby Mount Matean. The ceiling was arched but the roof surface was {{elevated}} because the outside walls were built to {{the same level as}} topmost of the arched ceiling so that walls and roof meet at same level outside.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The slip pews {{are made of}} oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|E

25|$|The female plays {{no role in}} parental care; {{the male}} takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or {{infertile}} eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins. During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return. The eggs hatch in 4–10 days {{over a period of}} 2–6 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7–10 days after hatching. The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2–4 days and becoming free swimming.|$|E
25|$|Asar Mahal or palace was {{constructed}} in 1646 by the Adil Shahis. It is located {{to the east of}} the citadel. A bridge connects it and it is well preserved. It also known as Dad Mahal since it was initially used as hall of justice. It was later converted as reliquary and has become a highly revered place since it is said to hold two hairs from the beard of Prophet Mohammed. The portico has impressive wooden columns (four numbers of octagonal shape) and is double the normal height and has wooden panelled ceiling. It faces an artificial lake. The <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the hall display landscape paintings. Women are prohibited from entering this Mahal.|$|E
25|$|The Capilla de Calvario or Calvary Chapel is {{the largest}} of the complex and was built between 1763 and 1766. It was also the last that Father Neri had built {{although}} he did not live to see its completion. It has a cross layout and is topped with vaults and a cupola. Its decoration is almost purely Mexican Baroque with monumental oil paintings and groups of painted statues that are placed on the floor, <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The columns contain inscriptions of poems written by Father Neri. The three altars contain the best of the sculptures and enclose the transept. These sculptures depict the crucifixion, agony, and descent of Christ after his death.|$|E
