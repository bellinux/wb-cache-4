25|$|Continuing {{from the}} prologue, Naomi manages to save Ayumi and takes {{her to a}} hospital. The Shinozaki estate and tome {{subsequently}} vanish without a trace. Ayumi had been severely ill for her misuse of the Book of Shadows' black magic. In the hospital, a woman claiming to be a spiritual associate of Hinoe's visits Ayumi. This woman belongs to the Wiccan Institute, an organization that worships spirits. She tells her Hinoe's last wish, which is to regain the Book of Shadows or the world <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the abyss. This is partially a lie, as the woman is under threat of other organizations to get Ayumi to find the book, which they wish to use for their own gain.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{the levels}} of service {{available}} <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> one of three categories; Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning nurses and/or physicians working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, {{and where it is}} present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include Emergency Medical Technician, Ambulance Technician, or Paramedic. These ambulance care givers are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or the lack of it. In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the environment in which they operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.|$|E

500|$|Although Falstaff {{has become}} a regular {{repertoire}} work there nonetheless remains a view expressed by John von Rhein in The Chicago Tribune in 1985: [...] "Falstaff probably always <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the category of 'connoisseur's opera' rather than taking its place as a popular favorite {{on the order of}} La Traviata or Aida." [...] As noted by Operabase, during the 2012–13 season, the work appeared at number 32 of the 50 operas most often performed; in the 2009–10 season it ranked at number 24.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 May each year the Minehead Hobby Horse visits Dunster and is {{received}} at the Castle. A local newspaper printed in May 1863 says [...] "The origin professes to be in commemoration of the wreck of a vessel at Minehead in remote times, or {{the advent of a}} sort of phantom ship which entered the harbour without Captain or crew. Once the custom was encouraged, but now is much neglected, and perhaps soon <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> desuetude." [...] Another conjecture about its origin is that the hobby horse was the ancient King of the May. The Hobby Horse tradition begins with the waking of the inhabitants of Minehead by the beating of a loud drum. The hobby horse dances its way about the town and on to Dunster Castle.|$|E

Actor Joshua Jackson explained the move in April 2009, [...] " [...] for boring reasons. They only had 22 airdates for our show this year, but they ordered 23 episodes, so we shot one for next year, which is just silly TV network stuff. It's not for any cool reason like we had something we needed in New York that we couldn't shoot elsewhere. It's just an accounting issue." [...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes. It's a stand-alone, but it still honors the condition that we know it <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II {{consists}} of four levels called [...] "domains," [...] each named after the four elementals. In each domain, Kuros must find a golden artifact that belongs to the domain's [...] "Animal King" [...] {{and return it to}} him. Upon doing so, the path to {{the second part of the}} domain will appear. In the second part, Kuros must find the magic spell necessary to defeat the boss – the domain's Elemental. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the IronSword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain. Throughout the game, players must collect items, spells, and money to progress. Money helps buy magic spells, more powerful weapons, shields, helmets, keys to open locked treasure chests, and additional food. Treasure chests — located throughout the game — can contain one of the following items: Additional money, magic spells, or weapon and armor upgrades. In each domain, players can visit inns where they can buy food, keys, or items; they may also participate in a [...] "Bonus chance" [...] game where they may gamble their money to see which cup a bouncing skull <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into.</b>|$|E
500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, {{and he saw the}} World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

2500|$|A {{polyhedron}} is stellated {{by extending}} the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again {{to form a}} new polyhedron or compound.

2500|$|Before {{war broke}} out, {{military}} arms for the C.S.A. states were in short supply. There was also little gunpowder stored among the seceded states, {{and the availability}} of fuses and percussion caps was also very limited (the caps in the South amounting to only a half a million). There was no machine to produce them in any of the Confederate states. Powder supplies in Florida were so low that, in April 1861, General John B. Grayson warned Jefferson Davis in Richmond: [...] "As sure as the sun rises, unless cannon powder, etc., be sent to Florida in the nextthirty days, she <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the North. Nothing human can prevent it." [...] The same urgent demand for military ordnance and supplies was dispatched to Richmond from every military center throughout the South.

2500|$|Monopolistic {{competition}} {{is a type}} of imperfect competition such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. In the presence of coercive government, monopolistic competition <b>will</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> government-granted monopoly. Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity. Models of monopolistic competition are often used to model industries. Textbook examples of industries with market structures similar to monopolistic competition include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities. The [...] "founding father" [...] of the theory of monopolistic {{competition is}} Edward Hastings Chamberlin, who wrote a pioneering book on the subject, Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933).
