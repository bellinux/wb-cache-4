5|$|Both London and Kendrick were drafted to the Raw brand on June 17, 2007, {{during the}} Supplemental Draft. They won their debut match on Raw against The World's Greatest Tag Team on June 18. Throughout July and August, they {{wrestled}} against The World's Greatest Tag Team and Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch on Raw, and on September 3, they won a number one contender's match for Cade and Murdoch's World Tag Team Championship. At a house show in South Africa on September 5, London and Kendrick defeated Cade and Murdoch {{to win the}} World Tag Team Championship, only to lose it back in a rematch three days later. At the end of 2007, he was inactive due to a foot injury. London returned on the February 4, 2008, episode of Raw, when he and Kendrick lost to the team of Carlito and Santino Marella. On the March 17 episode of Raw, London and Kendrick faced Umaga in a handicap match. During the match, Kendrick <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> left London to get pinned; no dissension came of the incident, and London and Kendrick continued to team together. They unsuccessfully challenged Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes for the World Tag Team Championship on May 26.|$|E
25|$|The Beatles {{sessions}} {{allowed the}} four members {{to work on}} separate projects {{at the same time}} and, as a result, kept tensions to a minimum. However, tempers flared during the recording session on 22 August 1968, and Ringo Starr <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> announced that he had quit.|$|E
25|$|After {{a tumultuous}} two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth {{in the face}} in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January 2006, {{the trial}} was thrown in disarray after a {{courtroom}} session in which Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was dragged away by guards, the defense team <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> Saddam was ejected following a slanging match with chief judge Rauf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, who had replaced former chief judge Rizgar Amin, who resigned after complaining of government interference.|$|E
25|$|At {{the conference}} however, {{there was still}} much dissension. The seven {{expelled}} federations and the Michigan party demanded that the Left wing go ahead and form a communist party, while the group around the Revolutionary Age still {{wanted to try to}} take over the Socialist party at its September convention. The Federations and the Michigan group <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> formed a National Organization Committee, which was set on organizing a founding Communist convention to rival the socialist convention in September. They also began publishing their own newspaper, The Communist.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, she {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the state temperance convention, but the chairman stopped her {{when she tried to}} speak, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Anthony and some other women immediately <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> announced a meeting of their own, which created a committee to organize a women's state convention. Largely organized by Anthony, the convention of 500 women met in Rochester in April and created the Women's State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.|$|E

25|$|The last {{objective}} was the castle {{just above the}} harbour where fire was concentrated with Vickers machine guns and mortars opening up on the battlements. While crossing a bridge SBS men became pinned down and had to stay there for a while. Fighting was bitter {{and the majority of}} the casualties were taken in this area, but mortar fire was concentrated on the castle. A captured German officer and a Royal naval Lieutenant seconded to the SBS called out for the castle to surrender and after three hours of further fighting an Italian Carabinieri unit <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Lee bowled 17 overs, and conceded 111 runs, but got the one wicket of Pietersen, {{who pulled}} to Simon Katich for 71 off 76 balls, {{and with the}} score on 342 for 7 with 24 {{scheduled}} overs remaining in the day. Then, Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in a 15-minute 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally {{got the better of}} Hoggard, to end with four for 116, but by that time England had gone past 400 and ended up with a total of 407 in just under 80 overs. Just as Australia's opening batsman <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> prepared for their innings, the rain began to fall on Edgbaston, and play had to be stopped.|$|E
25|$|Several major strikes {{occupied}} the union {{in its first}} three years. In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other Teamster locals, but three locals <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> eventually disaffiliated over the sympathy-strike issue. A sympathy strike in support of 18,000 striking meat cutters in Chicago in July 1904 led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led Shea to force his members back to work (leading {{to the collapse of}} the meat cutters' strike). In the midst of the strife in 1904, the Teamsters convention in Cincinnati, Ohio re-elected Shea by acclamation on August 8, 1904. Under his leadership, the union had expanded to nearly 50,000 members in 821 locals in 300 cities, making the Teamsters one of the largest unions in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{short history}} of the event, however, was {{littered}} with controversies. The 2002 United States Grand Prix was marred by a bizarre ending, in which Michael Schumacher, having already clinched the championship, seemingly tried to stage a dead heat with teammate Rubens Barrichello. The official timings showed Barrichello ahead by 0.011 seconds at the line, leading fans and media to dub the event a farce. The 2002 race {{was also the first}} ever Formula One race to use SAFER barriers. The 2005 race {{turned out to be one}} of the most controversial races in motorsport history. Michelin realized their tires were ill-equipped for the banking, and at the last second, the Michelin teams pulled into the pits at the end of the formation lap, leaving only the three Bridgestone teams (six cars) to contest the race. Fans and media were highly critical of the poor handling of the situation. Many fans <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> costly ticket refunds were issued.|$|E
500|$|By this time, Tallon {{was losing}} his hearing, and gained the derisive {{nickname}} Deafy. In one Test, {{he had been}} told by captain Lindsay Hassett before going out to bat that there was to be an appeal for bad light. Hassett said [...] "go for the light" [...] but Tallon misheard it as [...] "go for a lash". Tallon <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> was dismissed for a low score after attempting to attack the English bowlers, leaving his skipper displeased.|$|E
500|$|Cagney had {{demonstrated}} {{the power of}} the walkout in keeping the studios to their word. He later explained his reasons, saying, [...] "I walked out because I depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this, that or other promise, and when the promise was not kept, my only recourse was to deprive them of my services." [...] Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system. Normally, when a star walked out, the time he or she was absent was added onto the end of an already long contract, as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis. Cagney, however, <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> came back to a better contract. Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled.|$|E
50|$|Refueling {{the plane}} wasn't their only concern. The engine needed regular {{maintenance}} during the flight {{in order to}} stay in good running order. To facilitate this, a catwalk was built so that Fred could <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> work on the plane while it was airborne.|$|R

500|$|In November 1997 at {{a conference}} in Princeton University Hata was confronted by Iris Chang, author of the book The Rape of Nanking, who asked him why he doubted the {{testimony}} of Japanese POWs who had stated that hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed in the atrocity. When Hata replied that torture and coercion of Japanese POWs made their testimony unreliable Chang <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the audience became unruly, shouting Hata down and yelling insults at him. The moderator Perry Link barely kept the situation under control. In the wake of this incident, similar disruptions by Chinese students who disagreed with his death toll estimate prevented Hata from speaking at a number of universities that he visited. Bob Wakabayashi of York University argues that Hata became more strident in his tone following these attacks, once calling it the [...] "Nanking industry" [...] in comparison with Norman Finkelstein's [...] "Holocaust industry". In the 1980s Hata had stated that the death toll was 38,000 to 42,000 while holding out the possibility that it might have been as high as 60,000, but when he wrote the second edition of Nankin Jiken in 2007 he indicated that 42,000 massacred was the maximum possible and that the true number might have been lower.|$|E
500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere she went {{in the days after}} the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E
2500|$|Polly found Dick's {{temperament}} to be {{far from}} her own. When they had a son, William Jacob, on February 4, 1916, she found [...] "Dick was not the most indulgent of parents and like his father before him, he forbade the gurgles and cries of infancy; when they occurred he <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> often walked back unsteadily." ...|$|E
50|$|Olivia {{is lying}} in her {{hospital}} bed being watched over by Fitz, {{who tries to}} get close to her. They argue, and Olivia tells him she does not believe him when he tells her he loves her. Fitz <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> discusses the attack with Jake.|$|R
50|$|Back at the cockfighting arena, {{the bear}} was {{depressed}} by his defeat and doesn't {{know what to}} do next. He tries to get his rooster back on its feet, only to see it fall again.

50|$|The Dudleys {{approach}} {{as the sun}} rises. Mr. Dudley asks Dr. Marrow if he found {{what he wanted to}} know, but the traumatized psychiatrist does not give an answer, and neither does Theo. When the gate opens, the two silently <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> down the road, leaving Hill House behind them.|$|R
2500|$|Terry Knight, {{a singer}} on Capitol Records, had {{witnessed}} the Beatles' White Album session during which drummer Ringo Starr had <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and,</b> in May 1969, released {{a song called}} [...] "Saint Paul" [...] about the impending break-up of the Beatles. The tune {{made its way to}} the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart at No. 114 in late June that year and was quickly forgotten until a few months later, when it was picked up by radio stations as a tribute to [...] "the late" [...] Paul McCartney.|$|E
2500|$|Internationally, Taaffe won {{majority}} {{support in}} the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI). The opposition to the Open Turn internationally <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> founded the Committee for a Marxist International and its in Defence of Marxism website. The CWI later founded a website [...] in part to publish the documents written by Peter Taaffe {{and others in the}} CWI about these and other developments and debates, as a contribution to an analysis of what they perceive to be the complexities of the current period, and how to build the path to the working class for the ideas of Marxism.|$|E
2500|$|Uncle Ben: Willy's {{older brother}} {{who became a}} diamond tycoon after a detour to Africa. [...] He is dead, but Willy {{frequently}} speaks to him in his hallucinations of the past. Ben frequently boasts, [...] "when I was seventeen I walked into the jungle, and when I was twenty-one I <b>walked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>And</b> by God I was rich." [...] He is Willy's role model, although he is much older and has no real relationship with Willy, preferring to assert his superiority over his younger brother. He represents Willy's idea of the American Dream success story, and is shown coming by the Lomans' house while on business trips to share stories.|$|E
6000|$|Being drugged, {{he is in}} {{a dreamy}} state; knows not clearly what has occurred, or who {{attacked}} him.

5000|$|However, {{the school}} board refuses to {{consider}} the suggestions so Paula urges the students to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of school. The police find <b>out</b> <b>and</b> the principal threatens to expel Paula if she <b>walks</b> <b>out.</b> Paula's father urges against her plan of [...] "walking out." [...] He believes that the group {{is a bunch of}} [...] "agitators."
