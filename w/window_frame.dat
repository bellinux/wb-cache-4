5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 2,254houses were flooded in the country, forcing {{thousands}} of people to evacuate. Overall, 2,694houses were damaged, and another 12 were destroyed. Many houses lost their roofs, and high winds left 608,130buildings without power in Honshu, along with thousands of power on Hokkaido. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines. High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels. Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed. Storm debris injured several people, and a steel <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> struck and killed a man in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person. Insured damage in Japan totaled $2.14billion (¥261billion 2002JPY). In Iwate Prefecture, there was about $73million (¥8billion 2002JPY) in damage, mostly from damaged roads and public buildings. Agriculture damage in the prefecture $18.3million (¥2billion 2002JPY) {{for the first time}} since Typhoon Mireille in 1991. There were five deaths, and 108people were injured; this included 55people who were injured in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|Traditional storm {{windows and}} screens are time {{consuming}} and very labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage {{of the storm}} windows in the spring, and reinstallation {{in the fall and}} storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.|$|E
25|$|After {{the launch}} on July 28, 1973, and {{entering}} Skylab, the spiders were released by astronaut Owen Garriott {{into a box}} that resembled a <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> The spiders proceeded to construct their web while a camera took photographs and examined the spiders' behavior in a zero-gravity environment.

25|$|By the 1970s Riverside High school, {{like many}} older urban schools, {{was in a}} state of rapid decay. The windows leaked water and snow, and the building's heating system was unable to keep the staff and {{students}} warm. Nearly all aspects of the building were in disrepair. It was decided that a second addition and a renovation were in order. After a careful review, the building was retrofitted with new Plexiglass windows. Unfortunately the new windows yellowed over time and blocked much of the sunlight, as well as covered most of the <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{religious}} and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise {{a fine example of}} the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or moulded <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> Among the finest is the madrassa al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.|$|E

The original photograph underwent {{a number of}} tweaks {{to arrive at the}} final image. The fifth floor of the building had to be cropped out to fit the square album cover format. The buildings to the left and right were also changed to match the style of the double front. Tiles were added on the roof section along with more faces. Part of the top right railing balcony was left out for a whole <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> to be visible. The front cover is a daytime shot, while the back cover was taken at night.|$|E
25|$|The window {{treatments}} {{were another}} area of disagreement between du Pont and Boudin. Du Pont wanted the window treatments inside the <b>window</b> <b>frame,</b> to expose the moldings. Boudin felt this made the room appear too tall. After the two discussed the issue in early 1961, du Pont's view won out. But in late 1962, Boudin removed these window treatments and implemented one he had used many times before in many different homes: Straight panels to hide the side moldings, with a Baroque Revival flat panel to cover the top molding and rods. The fabric used was the same Boudin had selected for the wall covering, but trimmed with a French-made decorative silver tape.|$|E
25|$|On 7 January, they {{constructed}} a raft from the <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> of a house; {{after two days}} of drifting on the raft they were swept out to sea on the morning of 9 January, where Cdr. Bridgeman, who was not a strong swimmer, died of exhaustion and exposure. Moon tried to keep Bridgman on the raft but he slipped off into the sea. After Moon had been on the raft for some thirteen hours the tide turned and the raft was thrown onto the shore. Moon was rescued by natives who handed him over to the Germans, who interred him in a prisoner of war camp. He was released from captivity on 21 November 1917.|$|E

25|$|The first shell {{exploded}} in the garden, causing the officers at the meeting {{to go to the}} windows of the garden room to see the fall of the shell. Thus they were in the worst possible position for the second shell which exploded right in the <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> of the room. The explosion killed six officers and mortally wounded two others. The third shell impacted an empty part of the house, although the owner, Baron de Vinck, narrowly escaped injury. Monro had stepped into another room for a conference with his Chief of Staff and so survived with minor injuries, but Lomax was seriously wounded and evacuated back to England, being placed in a nursing home in London where he received palliative care for the next five months.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Tunnel 13, Stoney Creek Station is reached, at 22.53km. Within {{a cutting}} a siding {{branches}} {{off the main}} line and runs parallel and {{to the south of}} the main line, rejoining at the west end of the station. A shelter shed with an enclosed office in its south-east corner is located between the siding and the main line. The shed has an earth floor and a hipped roof, and the timber walls and posts are mounted on concrete wall and post bases. The timber framed walls of the office section are single skinned, and are clad with chamferboards. The office has open window frames on the south and west sides, a pivoting timber window to the east side and a timber door on the north side. The main open space of the shed has a single skinned timber wall (with a gap above the concrete wall base) on the south side, which has an open <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a <b>window</b> <b>frame,</b> the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
500|$|As the Comet {{represented}} {{a new category}} of passenger aircraft, more rigorous testing was a development priority. From 1947 to 1948, de Havilland conducted an extensive research and development phase, {{including the use of}} several stress test rigs at Hatfield for small components and large assemblies alike. Sections of pressurised fuselage were subjected to high-altitude flight conditions via a large decompression chamber on-site, and tested to failure. However, tracing fuselage failure points proved difficult with this method, and de Havilland ultimately switched to conducting structural tests with a water tank that could be safely configured to increase pressures gradually. The entire forward fuselage section was tested for metal fatigue by repeatedly pressurising to [...] overpressure and depressurising through more than 16,000 cycles, equivalent to about 40,000hours of airline service. [...] The windows were also tested under a pressure of , [...] above expected pressures at the normal service ceiling of [...] One <b>window</b> <b>frame</b> survived , about 1,250 percent over the maximum pressure it was expected to encounter in service.|$|E
500|$|The oldest {{window is}} to {{the east side of}} the porch, on the south wall, which dates from about 1400; it has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion) topped by trefoils, set in a rectangular <b>window</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] It is echoed by a 19th-century window on the same wall, set slightly higher to illuminate the pulpit. [...] The north wall has two rectangular windows, one with a pair of lights topped by cinquefoils, the other a single light with a trefoil at the top. One of the windows has been inserted into an opening previously used as a doorway. The east window, which has three lights, dates from the latter part of the 15th century, and is the only window to contain stained glass. Inside, the division between nave and chancel is marked with a pointed arch, dating from about 1400. Seating is provided in the form of painted box pews, dating from the 19th century, and possibly installed at the time of the restoration work in 1823.|$|E
