5|$|In October 1884, a {{convention}} {{held by the}} Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions unanimously set May 1, 1886, as the date by which the eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day</b> would become standard. As the chosen date approached, U.S. labor unions prepared for a general strike {{in support of the}} eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA {{published}} a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several {{changes to the}} HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the <b>work</b> <b>day</b> under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed {{since the end of}} the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of that length or longer to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the <b>work</b> <b>day</b> could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{pressure}} {{continued for}} the establishment of the 8-hour day. At the convention of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1888, the union decided to campaign for the shorter workday again. May 1, 1890, was agreed upon as the date on which workers would strike for an eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sunday {{was not a}} <b>work</b> <b>day,</b> but {{the prisoners}} did not rest; they were {{required}} to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower. Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.|$|E
5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day</b> and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase {{the rights of women}} in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day</b> for public workers.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier. The tariff revisions {{of the past four}} years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position. Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new Populist Party candidate, James Weaver, who promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day.</b> The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well, although the federal government did not take action.|$|E
5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this <b>work,</b> <b>Day,</b> known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the <b>work</b> <b>day</b> was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The Russo-Japanese War {{had caused}} rising dissent {{throughout}} the Russian Empire, including its Polish provinces. On 26 January 1905 about 6,000 workers in Łódź {{took part in}} a large strike. Next day, a general strike was declared, and the day after that, 70,000 workers were on strike. They demanded an 8-hour <b>work</b> <b>day</b> and support for the sick. Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who demanded an end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. It affected close to half of the city's industry. On 3 May, the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution, another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place. On 30 May, Łódź's industrialists asked the Russian governor-general for help.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the tariff worked to the Republicans' {{advantage}} in 1888. The legislative revisions {{of the past four}} years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour <b>work</b> <b>day.</b> The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} <b>work</b> <b>day</b> and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
