What price did you put on rationality? How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{some time}} wandering, Tiriel {{eventually}} {{arrives at the}} [...] "pleasant gardens" [...] (2:10) of the Vales of Har, where he finds his parents, Har and Heva. However, they have both become senile and have regressed to a childlike state {{to such an extent}} that they think their guardian, Mnetha, is their mother. Tiriel lies about <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> is, claiming that he was cast into exile by the gods, who then destroyed his race; [...] "I am an aged wanderer once father of a race/Far in the north. but they were wicked & were all destroyd/And I their father sent an outcast" [...] (2:44-46). Excited by the visit, Har and Heva invite Tiriel to help them catch birds and listen to Har's singing in the [...] "great cage" [...] (3:21). Tiriel refuses to stay, however, claiming his journey is not yet at an end, and resumes his wandering.|$|E

Is it not a case of a fortiori, that regarding the School of Shammai—that the halakhah does not go according to them—they [...] said ‘if [...] like the School of Shammai [...] according to their leniencies and their stringencies’: The RaMBaM, is the greatest of all the Torah authorities, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [...] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon themselves as their Chief Rabbi. Whoever practices according to him with his leniencies and his stringencies, why coerce them to budge from him? And all the more so if also their fathers and forefathers practiced accordingly: for their children are not to turn right or left from the RaMBaM of blessed memory. And even if communities that practice according to the Rosh or other authorities like him became the majority, they cannot coerce the minority of congregations practicing according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to practice like they do. And there is no issue here concerning the prohibition against having two courts in the same city , since every congregation should practice according to its original custom… ...|$|E
