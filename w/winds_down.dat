5|$|July 13, 1996- Tropical Storm Bertha crosses {{over the}} state with a peak wind gust of 58mph (93km/h) at Dover. The <b>winds</b> <b>down</b> {{scattered}} trees, signs, and power lines, leaving 3,200 homes without power for 8hours. The storm produces moderate rainfall across the state, causing drainage problems. Prior to moving across the state, Bertha causes rough surf, resulting in 40 water rescues. Overall damage is minor, and no deaths occurred.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 2004– Hurricane Ivan strikes Orange Beach, Alabama {{as a major}} hurricane, {{with its}} large and {{powerful}} circulation producing peak wind gusts of 107mph (173km/h) in Pensacola. The <b>winds</b> <b>down</b> more than 125,000ft³ (3,540m³) at a forest near Pensacola, while strong waves and a 10–15foot (3—4.5m) storm surge severely damages the Interstate 10 bridge in Pensacola. Throughout the state damage totals $8billion (2004USD, $10.3billion 2017USD), and 14people die in the state from the hurricane.

5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven casinos in Atlantic City are closed, {{resulting in a}} loss of $7million (1985USD). Dubbed by some as the storm of the century, the hurricane is expected to become the first hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall along the shoreline, though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong <b>winds</b> <b>down</b> trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed at the lack of damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the <b>winds</b> <b>down.</b> The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{vegetation}} {{is relatively}} dense, but contains many introduced floral species. The Burnside Council {{in recent years}} has paid particular attention to retaining and planting native plant species when upgrading/maintaining its reserves. This is in stark comparison to past times when native vegetation was replaced by European species in keeping with the wishes of the then population. First Creek, which has its origins in the Mount Lofty Ranges and Adelaide hills flows through both the suburb and the park. It is a seasonal creek and runs dry throughout much of the summer months. The creek <b>winds</b> <b>down</b> from Waterfall Gully, through Burnside into Hazelwood Park and then continues on to join the River Torrens near the Adelaide Botanical Gardens. Apart from Hazelwood Park, the only other notable reserve is the Ray Cooper Gardens, situated near the midpoint of Linden Avenue.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. They called the entry [...] "shallow and pretentious, and {{internally}} inconsistent" [...] and derided its plot. They wrote that [...] "at the centre of [...] mythology [...] a situation dependent on Mulder and a baby. One of them is absent, {{and one of them}} can't talk." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the line asking for Mulder's head, but praised the episode's teaser. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, also complimented the teaser sequence, calling it [...] "glorious", but was heavily critical {{of the rest of the}} episode's [...] "confused and impenetrable" [...] story. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He wrote that [...] "as this series <b>winds</b> <b>down,</b> you would think Carter and Spotnitz would be in a hurry to resolve some of the myriad of questions they've posed.

A musical piece titled [...] "Dramatic Soap Opera" [...] was created specifically for the between-night soap opera, The Immortal and The Restless.
