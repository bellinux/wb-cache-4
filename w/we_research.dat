Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June 1981 that [...] "our competitors thought that consumers didn't want to learn programming. <b>We</b> <b>Research</b> think they failed because of this and because of price." [...] Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved {{it to be a}} false assumption. The TS1000/ZX81's price advantage was erased when its main rivals - the Texas Instruments TI99/4A and the Commodore VIC 20 - had their prices cut to below the all-important $100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready-made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound.|$|E

The strategies <b>we</b> <b>research</b> emphasize a minimal reliance on fossil fuels and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is to direct its course towards a greener, saner world.Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world {{are in the process of}} destroying it."

This was later addressed by Ebro Darden and Rosenberg on their morning show, responding to remarks that include the charge that Hot 97 is a “CORPlantation,” but Darden, who admits that he agrees with Chuck D on addressing the issues, later pointed out by responding that “I think there’s validity to what he’s saying as to, ‘I guess Hot 97 could be more local,” and added “But people that listen to us when <b>we</b> <b>research</b> the songs don’t vote those songs high enough to stay around.

5000|$|Child Identity is {{not only}} a {{psychological}} structure, but also a complex subject of contemporary humanitarian science. Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When <b>we</b> <b>research</b> the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. [...] Erik Erikson (1902-1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing {{under the influence of the}} environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes.|$|E
5000|$|However, Derek Abbott, {{a leading}} Parrondo's paradox {{researcher}} provides the following answer {{regarding the use}} of the word 'paradox' in this context: [...] Is Parrondo's paradox really a [...] "paradox"? This question is sometimes asked by mathematicians, whereas physicists usually don't worry about such things. The first thing to point out is that [...] "Parrondo's paradox" [...] is just a name, just like the [...] "Braess' paradox" [...] or [...] "Simpson's paradox." [...] Secondly, as is the case with most of these named paradoxes they are all really apparent paradoxes. People drop the word [...] "apparent" [...] in these cases as it is a mouthful, and it is obvious anyway. So no one claims these are paradoxes in the strict sense. In the wide sense, a paradox is simply something that is counterintuitive. Parrondo's games certainly are counterintuitive—at least until you have intensively studied them for a few months. The truth is we still keep finding new surprising things to delight us, as <b>we</b> <b>research</b> these games. I have had one mathematician complain that the games always were obvious to him and hence we should not use the word [...] "paradox." [...] He is either a genius or never really understood it in the first place. In either case, it is not worth arguing with people like that.|$|E
