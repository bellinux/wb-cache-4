5|$|While {{playing with}} the Flyers, Vanbiesbrouck and his family lived in Moorestown Township, New Jersey. He and his wife, Rosalinde, have four sons, Ian, Ben, Nicholas and Daniel. Ian was {{diagnosed}} <b>with</b> <b>Attention</b> Deficit Disorder (ADD) when he was five-years old. As a result, Vanbiesbrouck started the Vanbiesbrouck Foundation for children <b>with</b> <b>Attention</b> Deficit Disorder to increase awareness of and raise money for children with ADD. However, when he left Florida via free agency the foundation was dissolved and {{the mission of the}} program went into an information service based in South Florida. Vanbiesbrouck is also the celebrity sponsor of a golf event in support of The Alan T. Brown Foundation to Cure Paralysis. He returned to his home state of Michigan following his playing days.|$|E
5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> paid to the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E

5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|Many {{children}} with AS are initially misdiagnosed <b>with</b> <b>attention</b> {{deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). Diagnosing adults is more challenging, as standard diagnostic criteria are designed for children and the expression of AS changes with age. Adult diagnosis requires painstaking clinical examination and thorough medical history gained from both the individual and other people who know the person, focusing on childhood behavior.|$|E

Furious at the mess Bart made, Skinner has Homer and Marge come to the school, where they learn Bart has been diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>Attention</b> Deficit Disorder (ADD).
