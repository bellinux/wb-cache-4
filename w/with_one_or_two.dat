5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at {{one to two years}} of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season.

Basic-studies courses are generally taken {{during the first two}} years, advanced-studies during the final two years and integrative-studies courses in the final year. In addition to core courses students take electives, which offer basic instruction or in-depth work in particular subjects. Students may also take tutorials, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> students per course, tailored to their interests and similar in structure to the Oxford tutorial system.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> teeth at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites {{to the female}} by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from one to five days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E

5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} multicellular {{organisms that}} are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and {{these animals are}} also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans {{do not include the}} sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo is a mammal {{from the}} middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth, {{interpreted}} as the last premolar and the first two molars. The premolar consists of a central cusp <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> smaller cusps and a cingulum (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a trigonid of three cusps at the front and a talonid with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic molars, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in marsupial and placental mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; {{at the time of}} its discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where {{a subset of the}} colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E

5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> peaks {{that can be}} influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|Queens are polyandrous, {{meaning that}} queens will mate more than once; queens mate with one to nine males during a nuptial flight, and the {{effective}} number of mates per queen ranges from 1.0 to 11.4. Studies {{show that most}} queen ants will only mate <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> males. If the number of available male mates increases, the number of effective matings per queen decreases. Colonies are polygynous, meaning that a colony may house multiple queens; there are on average one to four queens per colony, and in multiple-queen colonies, the egg-laying queens are unrelated to one another. Based on a study, 11 of the 14 colonies tested were polygynous (78.57%), showing that this is common in jack jumper colonies. When the queen establishes a nest after mating, she will hunt for food to feed her young, making her semi-claustral. Nests can hold as few as 500 ants or as many as 800 to 1,000. Excavated nests typically have populations ranging from 34 to 344 individuals. Jack jumper ant workers are gamergates, having the ability to reproduce in colonies with or without queens.|$|E
5|$|The BPF {{returned}} to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that {{day or the}} next. One of Formidables Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May. The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days to replenish its ships {{for the next several}} days with minimal interference by the Japanese. On the morning of 18 May, armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger, which caught fire. The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on, but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour, not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard. Twenty-one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident. Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May.|$|E

5|$|The area {{is now one}} of {{the most}} ethnically and {{economically}} diverse in Louisville. Crime is becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks {{and bits of}} bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, {{over a period of}} 16 or 17 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is a robust and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short.
