25|$|The Sangiovese grape {{performs}} better <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> {{receive more}} direct sunlight, {{which is a}} benefit of the many hillside vineyards in Tuscany. The majority of the region's vineyards are found at altitudes of 500–1600 feet (150–500 meters). The higher elevations also increase the diurnal temperature variation, helping the grapes maintain their balance of sugars and acidity {{as well as their}} aromatic qualities.|$|E
25|$|The {{survival}} rate {{for people with}} melanoma depends upon when they start treatment. The cure rate is very high when melanoma is detected in early stages, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> easily be removed surgically. The prognosis is less favorable if the melanoma has spread {{to other parts of}} the body. As of 2003 the overall five year cure rate with Mohs' micrographic surgery was around 95 percent for recurrent basal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} Mercury {{as seen from}} Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° (superior conjunction with the Sun) <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> reach magnitude −2.6. At phase angles approaching 180° (inferior conjunction) the planet fades to about magnitude +5 with the exact brightness depending on the phase angle at that particular conjunction. This difference of more than 7 magnitudes corresponds to a change of over a thousand times in apparent brightness.|$|E

25|$|The {{singular}} number {{indicates that}} the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be {{in contrast with the}} singular, {{indicates that the}}re are many of the things denoted by the word. But sometimes, when a word doesn't have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn't indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).|$|E
25|$|The {{substitution}} rule demonstrates several common {{aspects of}} rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; {{one can tell}} whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, {{as is often the}} case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.|$|E
25|$|In Rubik's cubers' parlance, a {{memorised}} {{sequence of}} moves {{that has a}} desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology {{is derived from the}} mathematical use of algorithm, meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater is {{the water}} present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces {{and in the}} {{fractures}} of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.|$|E
25|$|We {{have seen}} (above) that the {{birefringence}} {{of a type}} of crystal is useful in identifying it, and thus detection of linear birefringence is especially useful in geology and mineralogy. Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, {{as seen in the}} photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, however there may be circular birefringence when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed enantiomers of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called racemic mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for organic molecules, a net circular birefringence (or optical activity) is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a polarimeter in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, {{at the end of which}} is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.|$|E
500|$|Weapons are {{distinguished}} {{into two}} categories, Blade (katana) and Long Blade (nōdachi): Blades are fast, while Long Blades are slower and deal higher damage. Three blades can be equipped {{at any one}} time: each blade has its own stats, determining the amount of damage that can be inflicted. When blocking or using a blade's Secret Art special move, its Soul Power gauge depletes: if emptied, the sword breaks and its offensive abilities are drastically reduced. When sheathed, the Soul Power regenerates. Soul Power can be gathered in various locations to restore Soul Power and the character's health. There are 108 blades that can be collected and forged in-game: forging blades requires Soul Power and [...] "spirit", and each blade has a level cap determining <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be forged. Weapon forging is governed by a weapon-based skill tree.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} some mixed reviews, however. Louis Pattison, reviewing for NME, {{said that the}} album would {{not be considered a}} classic, but complimented the material for a reduced emphasis on shock value. A reviewer for Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "A lack of 'oomph' prevents the album from landing a gut punch that would cover all of its flaws. Like an aging boxer, Manson lands jabs and the occasional uppercut, but he never topples his opponent." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph compared the record to the early work of English gothic rock band Bauhaus, and said that while it was [...] "undeniably effective [...] in small bursts," [...] he found the whole [...] "wearingly abrasive". Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim!, although he admired the ambition of the album, complained it was [...] "lazy <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> get away with it".|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to find the maximum clique, or the clique number, of an arbitrary n-vertex graph in time [...] by {{using one of the}} algorithms described above to list all maximal cliques in the graph and returning the largest one. However, for this variant of the clique problem better worst-case time bounds are possible. The algorithm of [...] solves this problem in time [...] It is a recursive backtracking scheme {{similar to that of the}} Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, but is able to eliminate some recursive calls <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be shown that the cliques found within the call will be suboptimal. [...] improved the time to , and [...] improved it to [...] time, at the expense of greater space usage. Robson's algorithm combines a similar backtracking scheme (with a more complicated case analysis) and a dynamic programming technique in which the optimal solution is precomputed for all small connected subgraphs of the complement graph. These partial solutions are used to shortcut the backtracking recursion. The fastest algorithm known today is a refined version of this method by [...] which runs in time [...]|$|E
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E
