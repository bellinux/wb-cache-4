2500|$|Snowden's {{decision}} to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station. Snowden first {{made contact with}} Glenn Greenwald, a journalist working at The Guardian, on December 1, 2012. He contacted Greenwald anonymously as [...] "Cincinnatus" [...] {{and said he had}} sensitive documents that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>share.</b> Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ. Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013. According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney. What originally attracted Snowden to both Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras' controversial films had made her a target of the government.|$|E

60|$|But why, {{might the}} lawyer reply, should rights founded on {{hereditary}} succession yield any more readily {{in the case}} of government than {{in the case of}} property? The distribution of property influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power. Suppose it were proved that the general welfare of your parish would be promoted by the division of your land among the destitute there. You have nothing to oppose to such a proposition but your hereditary right. And the king has that to oppose to any plan of a division of his prerogatives and powers among the people who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> them.|$|E
