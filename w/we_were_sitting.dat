5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E

Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> {{on top of a}} great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

He said one night, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in a Chinese inn upon our way to Shansi, [...] "I presume there are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief and a robber."

The group also stated, in an interview with MTV, that their father was the one that brought them together, as their parents were singers as well. When asked about where their name came from, the girls stated, [...] "It's funny because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in the hotel room {{trying to come up with}} a name for the group.

2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> in the dressing room and I cried. I realized what a mistake it was." ...|$|E

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
