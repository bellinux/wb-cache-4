We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom. When her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows. When, however, the freedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.|$|E
60|$|Captain Evans then {{directed}} us {{to report}} ourselves daily, which we did. But {{the press of}} business at Washington prevented our cases from being attended to; and being destitute of money, while wages were high, we determined, with Captain Evans' approbation, to make a voyage, each, in the merchant service, and to get our accounts settled on our return. Jack Mallet, Barnet and I, shipped, therefore, in another brig called the Venus, that was bound on a sealing voyage, as was thought, in {{some part of the}} world where seals were said to be plenty. We were ignorant of the work, or we might have discovered there was a deception intended, from the outfit of the vessel. She had no salt even, while she had plenty of cross-cut saws, iron dogs, chains, &c. The brig sailed, however, and stood across the Atlantic, as if in good earnest. When near the Cape de Verds, the captain called us aft, and told us he thought the season too far advanced for sealing, and that, if we would consent, he would run down to St. Domingo, and make an arrangement with some one there to cut mahogany on shares, with fustick and lignum-vitæ. The secret was now out; but what could we poor salts do? The work <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> do turned out to be extremely laborious; and I suppose we had been deceived on account of the difficulty of getting men, just at that time, for such a voyage. There we were, {{in the midst of the}} ocean, and we agreed to the proposal, pretty much as a matter of course.|$|E
6000|$|From {{our first}} arrival in Dublin, {{my father had}} brought me {{from time to time}} to see Edward Dowden. He and my father had been college friends and were trying, perhaps, to take up again their old friendship. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> breakfast, and {{afterwards}} my father would tell me to read out one of my poems. Dowden was wise in his encouragement, never overpraising and never unsympathetic, and he would sometimes lend me books. The orderly, prosperous house where all was in good taste, where poetry was rightly valued, made Dublin tolerable for a while, and for perhaps a couple of years he was an image of romance. My father would not share my enthusiasm and soon, I noticed, grew impatient at these meetings. He would sometimes say that he had wanted Dowden when they were young to give himself to creative art, and would talk of what he considered Dowden's failure in life. I know now that he was finding in his friend what he himself had been saved from by the conversation of the pre-Raphaelites. [...] "He will not trust his nature," [...] he would say, or [...] "he is too much influenced by his inferiors," [...] or he would praise [...] "Renunciants," [...] one of Dowden's poems, to prove what Dowden might have written. I was not influenced for I had imagined a past worthy of that dark, romantic face. I took literally his verses, touched here and there with Swinburnian rhetoric, and believed that he had loved, unhappily and illicitly; and when through the practice of my art I discovered that certain images about the love of woman were the properties of a school, I but changed my fancy and thought of him as very wise.|$|E

5000|$|I {{credit the}} {{supporters}} of the Treaty with being as honest as I am, but I have a sound objection to it. I think it is wrong; I have various reasons for objecting to it, but the main one is that, in my opinion, it was wrong against Ireland, and a sin against Ireland. I do not like talking here about oaths. I have heard about oaths until my soul is sick of them, but if this Treaty were forced on us by England — as it is being forced — and that paragraph 4, {{the one with the}} oath in it <b>were</b> omitted, <b>we</b> could accept it under force; but certainly, while those oaths are in it, oaths in which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> accept the King of England as head of the Irish State, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> accept the status of British citizens—British subjects—that we cannot accept.
