5|$|The Blue Line of the Washington Metro in the United States {{consists}} of 27 rapid transit stations from Franconia–Springfield to Largo Town Center.

It was the last line in the original Metrorail plan to be constructed, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington. It shares nine stations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Line, one station with the Blue, Silver and Orange lines, and two stations with the Red Line.|$|E

5|$|The species inhabits a {{strip of}} 25 {{equatorial}} African countries, very nearly ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are not clearly defined, as the species' territory overlaps with that of other baboon species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} {{to decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white, yellow and red <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E

5|$|The next season, the Yellow Jackets {{joined the}} EAHL. Brimsek {{finished}} with the most wins and shutouts of any goal tender in the league with 20 and 8 respectively. At {{the end of the}} season, he was named to the league's Second All-Star Team and he was awarded the George L. Davis Trophy for having the lowest goals against average (GAA). Impressed by Brimsek, Harris wanted to protect his interests in the goalie so he ironically had the Red Wings put Brimsek on their protected list. Harris then tried to get the Red Wings to call Brimsek up. However, the Red Wings wanted Brimsek to first play one year for their amateur team in Pontiac, but Brimsek turned down the offer. Brimsek opted to stay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Jackets instead. Harris then shopped Brimsek around the NHL until he was accepted by the Boston Bruins in October 1937. The Bruins were already well established in net with future hall-of-famer Tiny Thompson. This led to Brimsek being assigned by the Bruins to the Providence Reds of the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) for the 1937–38 season. In his only full season with the Reds, Brimsek helped his team win the Calder Cup and he was named to the league's First All-Star Team.|$|E

25|$|The name Blue River {{began to}} be applied in the 18th century, {{apparently}} owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of Jiang, Jiangkou, or Yangzijiang. Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names and to the irony of its application to such a muddy waterway.|$|E
