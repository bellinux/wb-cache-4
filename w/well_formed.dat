5|$|The {{relief is}} in a {{dilapidated}} condition {{with most of}} the arms and legs broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E
5|$|Steering {{currents}} above Alicia remained weak {{during the}} storm's lifetime. However, a ridge was <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> {{to the north}} of the developing storms. With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar an hour in the 40hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115mph (185km/h) in winds and 962millibars (28.39inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category3hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of {{communal}} {{activity in the}} area around Muscat dates back to the 6th millennium BCE in Ras al-Hamra, where burial sites of fishermen have been found. The graves appear to be <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> and indicate the existence of burial rituals. South of Muscat, remnants of Harappan pottery indicate some level of contact with the Indus Valley Civilisation. Muscat's notability as a port was acknowledged as early as the 1st century CE by the Greek geographer Ptolemy, who referred to it as Cryptus Portus (the Hidden Port), and by Pliny the Elder, who called it Amithoscuta.|$|E
25|$|Peridotites {{can take}} on a massive form or may be in layers. Layered peridotites may form the base layers of gabbroic complexes. Even though some layered peridotites appear to have no {{associated}} gabbro, they probably once were part of such a complex. Three main textures are found in peridotites: the first are <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> crystals of olivine surrounded by other minerals. These olivine crystals probably settled out of the magma first. Another texture is equal sized crystals with straight grain boundaries intersecting at 120°. This may result when slow cooling allowed recrystallization to minimize surface energy. A third texture has long crystals with ragged curvilinear boundaries, a result of internal deformation.|$|E
25|$|The {{track surface}} is variable. On the {{southern}} and eastern flanks, the track is reasonably <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> and the gradients are relatively steady. The northern branch is steeper and more rugged. The northern flank contains some particularly magnificent rain forests. The southern section of the track follows an early convict built road on Mount Keira, some of which is still visible. A similar feature, an early attempt to construct a carriageway, is visible west of the summit track on Mount Kembla. Also on the southern flank {{there is also an}} old telegraph camp site. The Ring Track is a locally well known and is popular with joggers, walkers and school groups. The track was rebuilt after it was damaged in 1998 by severe storms.|$|E

25|$|At {{the close}} of the sixteenth century the city was large, <b>well</b> <b>formed,</b> and remarkably healthy; most of its houses were built of brick and mortar with tiled roofs; the streets were broad, the chief of them with room enough for ten ox-carriages to drive abreast; and among its public {{buildings}} were large number of stone mosques, each with two large minarets and many wonderful inscriptions. Rich in the produce of every part of the globe, its painters, carvers, inlayers, and workers in silver gold and iron, were famous, its mint was one of four allowed to coin gold, and from its Imperial workshops came masterpieces in cotton, silk, velvet and brocade with astonishing figures and patterns, knots and fashions.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more retentive lower denture. An implant supported lower denture is another option.|$|E
25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on and admire the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the top of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E

25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees <b>well</b> <b>formed,</b> other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E
25|$|Though his {{rivalry with}} Takeda Shingen was legendary, Uesugi Kenshin {{actually}} {{had a number of}} other ventures occurring around the times of these famous battles (1553–1564). In the year 1559, he made a trip with escort of 5000 men to pay homage to the shogun in Kyoto. This served to heighten his reputation considerably, and added to his image as a cultured leader as well as a warlord. This same year he was pushed once again by Uesugi Norimasa {{to take control of the}} Kantō back from the Hōjō, and in 1560 he was able to comply. In August of the same year, he put southern Echigo under control of five man council for the broad mobilization, as <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> small investigative council for any kind of unrest. Heading a campaign against the Hōjō Ujiyasu from fall 1560 to the summer of 1561, Kenshin was successful in taking a number of castles from the clan, like Numata and Umayabashi castles, which ended with the first siege of the Odawara Castle in Sagami Province. He managed to break the defenses and burn the town, but the castle itself remained unconquered due to threats from Shingen, and thus seized Kamakura. In 1561, Kenshin saved his ally Ōta Sukemasa who was under siege by both Ujiyasu and Shingen, while in November 1569 when Shingen sieged Odawara Castle, Ujiyasu requested help from Kenshin.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{several of}} the {{developers}} of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated {{in an effort to}} improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.|$|E

500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function.

In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E
