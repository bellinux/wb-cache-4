For example, embassies representing non-English speaking countries such as the French Embassy are allowed to use their own languages because the language can be expressed in Roman script, thus explaining why the French embassy uses its French name. However, for the case of the Royal Thai Embassy, English was chosen to represent it in Singapore because the Thai script is not recognized as a script in any of Singapore's official languages, even though English is less widely used in Thailand than standard Thai.|$|E
25|$|Iceland is {{a member}} of the Nordic Council, a forum for {{co-operation}} between the Nordic countries, but it uses only Danish, Norwegian and Swedish as its <b>working</b> <b>languages</b> (although the Council does publish material in Icelandic). Under the Nordic Language Convention, since 1987 Icelandic citizens have had the right to use Icelandic when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries, without becoming liable for any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. It does not have much effect since it is not very well known, and because those Icelanders not proficient in the other Scandinavian languages often have a sufficient grasp of English to communicate with institutions in that language (although there is evidence that the general English skills of Icelanders have been somewhat overestimated). The Nordic countries have committed to providing services in various languages to each otherâ€™s citizens, but this does not amount to any absolute rights being granted, except as regards criminal and court matters.|$|E

Both English and Welsh are considered official languages of Wales, with Welsh further recognised in law as having [...] "official status". English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language {{in most of the}} country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [...] "Wenglish" [...] is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has [...] "been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh". Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh is recognised to be a thing of the past.|$|E
500|$|The Jin {{government}} initially promoted {{an independent}} Jurchen culture alongside their {{adoption of the}} centralized Chinese imperial bureaucracy, but the empire was gradually sinicized over time. The Jurchens became fluent in the Chinese language, and the philosophy of Confucianism was used to legitimize the ruling government. Confucian state rituals were adopted {{during the reign of}} Emperor Xizong (1135â€“1150). The Jin implemented imperial exams on the Confucian Classics, first regionally and then for the entire empire. The Classics and other works of Chinese literature were translated into Jurchen and studied by Jin intellectuals, but very few Jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the Jin. The Khitan script, from the Chinese family of scripts, formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire, the Jurchen script. All three scripts were <b>working</b> <b>languages</b> of the government. Jurchen clans adopted Chinese personal names with their Jurchen names. Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing; r. 1150â€“1161) was an enthusiastic proponent of Jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it. Wanyan Liang had been acculturated by Song diplomats from childhood, and his emulation of Song practices earned him the Jurchen nickname of [...] "aping the Chinese". He studied the Chinese classics, drank tea, and played Chinese chess for recreation. Under his reign, the administrative core of the Jin state was moved south from Huining. He instated Beijing as the Jin main capital in 1153. Palaces were erected in Beijing and Kaifeng, while the original, more northerly residences of Jurchen chieftains were demolished.|$|E

The AU also recognizes the national languages of each of its member institutions as stated in their national constitutions. In 2003, the AU adopted a protocol amending the Act such that <b>working</b> <b>languages</b> shall be renamed as official languages, and would encompass Spanish, Kiswahili and [...] "any other African language" [...] {{in addition to the}} four aforementioned languages [...] However, this Amendment has yet to be put into force, and the AU continues to use only the four <b>working</b> <b>languages</b> for its publications.|$|E
