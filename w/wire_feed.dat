5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Since the electrode is continuous, welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous <b>wire</b> <b>feed,</b> the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

The results reveal that: Along {{with the increase of}} the laser power, weld width and depth are increasing gradually; Coating surface will appear burning loss and deboss when laser power is too large. The increase of scanning velocity decreases the depth and width of molten bath, and abates laser hole-effect, so the metal plate can not be welded penetration.

This paper investigates the forming ability of vertical <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> with an axisymmetric multi-laser source, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components. It {{has been found that}} vertical <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> with an axisymmetric multi-laser source has a strong forming ability with no anisotropic forming problem when fabricating the complex parts in a three-axis machine tool. Most of the grains in the samples are equiaxed grains, and a small amount of short columnar grains exist which are parallel to each other. The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the <b>feeding</b> <b>wire.</b> The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|R
40|$|As laser brazing {{benefits}} from advantages such as smooth joints and small heat-affected zones, {{it has become}} established as a joining technology that is widely used in the automotive industry. With the processing of complex-shaped geometries, recent developed brazing heads suffer, however, from the need for continuous reorientation of the optical system and/or limited accessibility due to lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> This motivates {{the development of a}} laser brazing head with coaxial <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and enhanced functionality. An optical system is designed that allows to generate an annular intensity distribution in the working zone. The utilization of complex optical components avoids obscuration of the optical path by the <b>wire</b> <b>feeding.</b> The new design overcomes the disadvantages of the state-of-the-art brazing heads with lateral <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and {{benefits from}} the independence of direction while processing complex geometries. To increase the robustness of the brazing process, the beam path also includes a seam tracking system, leading to a more challenging design of the whole optical train. This paper mainly discusses the concept and the optical design of the coaxial brazing head, and also presents the results obtained with a prototype and selected application results...|$|R
500|$|Most {{applications}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding use a constant voltage power supply. [...] As a result, any change in arc length (which is directly related to voltage) results in a large change in heat input and current. A shorter arc length causes a much greater heat input, which makes the wire electrode melt more quickly and thereby restore the original arc length. This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand-held welding guns. To achieve a similar effect, sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage-controlled <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> unit. [...] In this case, a change in arc length makes the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate adjust to maintain a relatively constant arc length. In rare circumstances, a constant current power source and a constant <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate unit might be coupled, especially for the welding of metals with high thermal conductivities, such as aluminum. [...] This grants the operator additional control over the heat input into the weld, but requires significant skill to perform successfully.|$|E
500|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> unit {{supplies}} the electrode to the work, driving {{it through the}} conduit {{and on to the}} contact tip. [...] Most models provide the wire at a constant feed rate, but more advanced machines can vary the feed rate in response to the arc length and voltage. [...] Some wire feeders can reach feed rates as high as 30.5m/min (1200in/min), but feed rates for semiautomatic GMAW typically range from 2 to 10m/min (75 – 400in/min).|$|E
500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the <b>wire</b> <b>feed,</b> electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted <b>wire</b> <b>feed.</b> The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E

500|$|Further {{developments}} in welding steel with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool {{as a result of the}} lower <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate. [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E

40|$|Laser welding {{has a large}} {{potential}} {{for the production of}} tailor welded blanks in the automotive industry, due to the low heat input and deep penetration. However, due to the small laser spot and melt pool, laser-based welding processes in general have a low tolerance for seam gaps. In this paper, five laser-based welding techniques are compared for their gap bridging capabilities: single-spot laser welding, twin-spot laser welding, single-spot laser welding with cold <b>wire</b> <b>feeding,</b> twin-spot laser welding with cold <b>wire</b> <b>feeding</b> and laser/GMA hybrid welding. Welding experiments were performed on 1. 1 - and 2. 1 -mm-thick AA 5182 aluminium sheets.

The results show that the use of a filler wire is indispensable to increase the gap tolerance. A proper alignment of this wire with the laser spot(s) is crucial. With the single spot laser welding with cold <b>wire</b> <b>feeding,</b> a gap up to 0. 6 mm could be bridged as opposed to a maximum allowable gap width of 0. 2 mm for single-spot laser welding without filler wire.
