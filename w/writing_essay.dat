40|$|In most {{subjects}} that students complete {{as part of}} a Business or Commerce degree they are typically assessed by way of submitting a <b>written</b> <b>essay</b> and sitting for an exam. A student should be able to show in their <b>written</b> <b>essay</b> that they understand topics covered in the subject and have gained knowledge whilst <b>writing</b> the <b>essay.</b> Unfortunately, lecturers have found that the standard {{of a large number of}} <b>written</b> <b>essays</b> submitted by both undergraduate and postgraduate students can be fairly poor and display varying degrees of plagiarism. When marking an essay it is often difficult to know whether a student actually understands what they have <b>written</b> in their <b>essay.</b> This occurs in <b>essays</b> <b>written</b> by local students as well as <b>essays</b> <b>written</b> by overseas students whose first language is not English.
