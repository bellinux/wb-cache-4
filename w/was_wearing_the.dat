5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{married his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) over New Year's. However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As {{a result of what}} Liz <b>was</b> <b>wearing,</b> <b>the</b> minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married the two of them instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
5|$|HMS Shannon {{had been}} off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> ship down. She {{would be at}} a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished him in this regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since she carried a substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E

25|$|Anthony {{embarked}} on her career of social reform with energy and determination.

Soon she <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E

In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and his watch, and some spent cartridges. Moro had also a wound at the thigh, likely suffered during the initial assault in via Fani.|$|E
25|$|The first {{crash of}} the weekend {{occurred}} during the Friday afternoon session. Maurício Gugelmin crashed in turn 3. His car got loose exiting turn 2 and hit the inside wall at 66.2 Gs. His foot became lodged between the pedals, and the car accelerated. The car slid down the backstretch and hit the outside wall in turn 3 with a force of 113.1 Gs. The car continued to slide until it reached the apex between turn 3 and turn 4. Guglemin claims to have blacked out during the crash, {{but he was not}} seriously injured. Gugelmin <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> HANS device. He withdrew, nursing bruised shoulders and ribs, and sat {{out the rest of the}} weekend.|$|E
25|$|But when he {{was shot}} down Bryks <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> Mae West {{lifejacket}} of a Polish colleague from 242 Squadron, F/O Henry Skalsky. Therefore the Germans who questioned him at St Omer suspected he was Polish, and sent him to Dulag Luft at Oberursel in Hesse for interrogation by a Polish-speaking German officer. There he was accused of shooting a Luftwaffe fighter pilot who was parachuting from his Bf 109 in the air battle near St Omer on 17 June. For this he was threatened with being court-martialled in Berlin. After the war no such shooting was found in German records for that day. The accusation {{seems to have been a}} false one to put pressure Bryks.|$|E

25|$|The {{album cover}} {{contributed to the}} image of Jones as a stylish beret-wearing beatnik. Jones had said the {{inspiration}} of it was from a photo of her father (an aspiring musician and waiter) in a similar pose, lighting a cigarette while sitting on a beach towel at a Chicago beach along Lake Michigan, near where the family lived. Although Donna Summer had already been wearing berets and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wore one for the album cover of her 1976 album Hejira, it was Jones Parisian-boho jazz sensibility that finally popularized it, propelling as a mainstay of hipster chic and (perhaps unintentionally) branding her image in the process. Despite Jones' beautiful looks and street gamine wildness, she would recall that people seemed to only recognize her in public when she <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> beret. The album cover photography and design was by Norman Seeff.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva {{who created the}} world. Rabbi Akiva {{answered}} that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof.

Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not realize that a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize that the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} the story of the {{creation}} of the Onibaba involves the baby girl of a wealthy family in Kyoto. Although already five-years-old and otherwise healthy and happy, the child had not uttered a sound since birth. Worried and desperate, the family consulted doctor after doctor with no success until they came upon a fortune teller who told them that the cure was to feed the girl the fresh liver of a living fetus. This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman willing to give up her unborn child’s liver lasted for weeks and months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>the</b> omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E

25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she <b>was</b> <b>wearing.</b> <b>The</b> nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E
