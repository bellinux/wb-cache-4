25|$|In 1914 {{only two}} U.S. states allowed twenty round {{championship}} bouts to a verdict, Colorado and Louisiana, and no promoters in either state were offering large enough purses to risk losing the Championship title for. To earn {{as much money}} as he could from being the Champion, Welsh fought in as many ten round 'no verdict' matches as he could. As long as he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{at the end of the}} ten rounds, he could not lose his title. Still, Welsh wanted to show he was not going to choose soft opposition and began a series of bouts against serious contenders. His first defence was against Matty Baldwin on 27 October in Boston, a match he won on points. This was followed six days later by a contest against Al Wolgast, the former champion who had avoided Welsh when he had the title to lose. The fight was a near sell out at Madison Square Garden in New York, with the crowd firmly behind Wolgast. Although the first few rounds were fairly even between the two fighters, at the end of the fifth round Wolgast blocked an uppercut with his right arm. The blow broke his ulna three inches (76mm) above the wrist, forcing Wolgast to box on with just his left hand. Wolgast kept on fighting but could not continue after the eighth.|$|E

500|$|After {{arriving}} in The Hague, Nannerl developed a severe cold and {{was unable to}} participate in the initial concerts before the Princess during their first week, nor in a performance before the Prince a few days later. Leopold was sufficiently confident of Nannerl's recovery to announce the appearances of both prodigies at a concert to be given at the hall of the Oude Doelen on 30 September. The notice for this concert gives Wolfgang's age as eight (he was nine), but correctly gives Nannerl's as fourteen. The advertisement concentrates on Wolfgang: [...] "All the overtures will be from the hands of this young composer [...] Music-lovers may confront him with any music at will, and he will play it at sight". It is not certain whether this concert in fact took placeSadie believes it may have been postponed. If it did happen, Wolfgang appeared alone, for by this time Nannerl's cold had turned into typhoid fever. Her condition grew steadily worse, and on 21 October she was given the last sacrament. A visit from the royal physician turned the tide; he changed the treatment, {{and by the end of}} the month she was recovering. Then Wolfgang fell ill, and it was mid-December before he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> again.|$|E

500|$|The delegates {{assembled}} the next day, June 24, {{to resume the}} balloting. Before that could begin, Rufus Wheeler Peckham of the New York delegation produced Tilden's letter and read it to the crowd. [...] The first mention of Tilden's name provoked excitement, but {{the meaning of the}} message soon quieted the crowd. Peckham announced that, with Tilden's withdrawal, New York, now supported Samuel J. Randall. [...] Moving then to the second ballot, more than one hundred delegates followed Peckham's lead in voting for Randall, boosting his total to 128½, just above Bayard's 112. But the shift to Hancock had been greater. Before the totals were announced to the crowd, Hancock had gathered 320 delegates to him; as soon as the voting stopped, however, Wisconsin, and New Jersey changed all of their votes to Hancock. Pennsylvania added those of their votes that were not already for Hancock. [...] Then Smith M. Weed of New York, a Tilden confidante, announced that his state, too, would shift all of its 70 votes to Hancock. After that, according to the party records, [...] "every delegate <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and the roar of ten thousand voices completely drowned the full military band in the gallery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macedonian and United States {{had been}} berthed {{next to one}} another in 1810, in port at Norfolk, Virginia. The British captain John Carden bet a fur beaver hat that if the two ever met in battle, Macedonian would emerge victorious. However, the {{engagement}} in a heavy swell proved otherwise as United States pounded ' Macedonian into a dismasted wreck from long range. [...] During the engagement Decatur was standing on a box of shot when he was knocked down almost unconscious when a flying splinter struck him in the chest. Wounded, he soon recovered and <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in command again. Because of the greater range of the guns aboard United States, Decatur and his crew got off seventy broadsides, with Macedonian only getting off thirty, and consequently emerged from the battle relatively unscathed. Macedonian had no option but surrender, and thus was taken as a prize by Decatur. Eager to present the nation with a prize, Decatur and his crew spent two weeks repairing and refitting the captured British frigate to prepare it for its journey across the Atlantic to the United States.|$|E
