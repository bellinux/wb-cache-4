5|$|Symeon {{remained}} at the Saint Macrina monastery, where many close disciples, both monks and secular people, gathered around him. At Saint Macrina he was free of monks who were averse to his discipline and zeal, and free from direct conflict with church authorities. He continued to honor Symeon the Studite—most of the clergy from Constantinople, along with many monks and laymen, joined him during those celebrations. He also wrote during that time and made himself accessible to all who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Symeon spent the last thirteen {{years of his life}} in exile, dying from dysentery on March 12, 1022. According to his biographer and disciple, Nicetas, Symeon foretold his own death many years previously, and on his last day called together all the monks to sing the funeral hymns.|$|E

Lieberman said, [...] "We certainly hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Morsi hosting official Israeli representatives soon; we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> giving interviews <b>to</b> Israeli media; we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in Jerusalem as President (Shimon) Peres' guest." ...|$|R
5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that Kate had been asking about him, he believed that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling.

He also worked as a research assistant to Church Historian Leonard J. Arrington for 18 months. Quinn taught at BYU until he resigned in January 1988 due to the ongoing pressure from some authorities who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> leave. At BYU, he was elected once as best professor by the graduating class.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Dyer won the Metropolitan League's {{award for}} the best player {{at the age of}} 16. Richmond {{officials}} had not yet attempted to sign him, and Dyer applied for a clearance to play with the Tigers' main rival, Collingwood. The Richmond officials <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in action before any decision was made and Dyer was in training with Richmond {{for the start of the}} 1931 season. Richmond's coach 'Checker' Hughes pitting Dyer against veteran Joe Murdoch in a practice session. Dyer hardly touched the ball and was disheartened about his prospects until Hughes consoled him by explaining the pairing with Murdoch was a trial of courage, not skill.|$|E

25|$|As an amateur, he {{finished}} second in the 1995 junior World Championships and his first big result was winning the U-23 World Championships in 1998. In his youth he fiercely competed with fellow Italian riders Giuliano Figueras and especially Danilo Di Luca who proclaimed he would have won the U-23 World Championship himself {{had it not been for}} the team tactics. Before Basso could turn professional, his parents <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> finish his Technical Geometry studies. He turned professional with Davide Boifava's Riso Scotti-Vinavil team in 1999, where he rode his first Giro d'Italia. He did not finish the three-week race, but he made it a priority to win it some day. In 2000, with the team now called Amica Chips-Tacconi Sport, he won his first professional victories in the 2000 Regio-Tour.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, Guerrero {{competed in}} a tournament for the United States Championship. He managed {{to advance to the}} final round, {{defeating}} Último Dragón and Billy Gunn in the process, where he would meet Chris Benoit. At Vengeance, Guerrero turned to his cheating tactics, hitting Benoit with the belt {{at one point in the}} match. Guerrero tried to get Benoit in trouble by placing the title belt on top of the unconscious Benoit. It did not work, however, since he knocked out the referee earlier with a championship belt shot to the kidneys. The match ended with interference and a Gore from Rhyno, Benoit's own partner, who was furious at the team's failure. Guerrero himself said that this was a major point in the character of Latino Heat, since he himself realized that the fans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> lie, cheat, and steal. Guerrero pinned Benoit and won the United States Championship.|$|E
25|$|Gandhiji {{stayed in}} the Ashram {{and spoke to the}} volunteers. He tried to boost up their morale, by {{explaining}} to them the principle of Satyagraha and the role of scarifies and suffering in it, and the need for extreme patience. He tried to reach a compromise with the orthodoxy and for this; he had to meet the Savarna leaders. His secretary sent a note of invitation to the Savarna leader Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri to come over to the camp. The haughty Namboothiri not only refused to accept the invitation, but also said that those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> must go over to his house. So it was that Gandhiji and his party reached the Indanthuruthil Mana (a Namboothiri household) on the next day noon. They were made to sit in the portico of the house, while the Namboothiri and his Savarna comrades occupied the inner room. The Namboothiri believed that Gandhi and his followers were polluted by the touch of untouchables, and could not be admitted into the pure interior of an orthodox Mana.|$|E

25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and his run was extended and extended, {{as was the}} seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E
500|$|Glass Joe {{has come}} to be {{considered}} one of Punch-Out!!s signature characters. He was included in a series of trading cards which depict various Punch-Out!! boxers. Both UGO's Chris Plante and G4TV's [...] "jmanalang" [...] considered the fight with Glass Joe {{one of the most memorable}} NES moments. Plante felt that it was even more memorable than the in-game fight with Mike Tyson. GameDaily's Chris Buffa called Glass Joe one of the most unappreciated Nintendo characters and said that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> succeed.|$|E
500|$|Later in life, when Cibber {{himself had}} {{the last word in}} casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several tragedies that were {{tailored}} to fit his continuing hankering after playing [...] "a Hero". However, his performances of such parts never pleased audiences, which <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> typecast as an affected fop, a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man, his exaggerated, mannered style of acting, and his habit of ad libbing. His most famous part {{for the rest of his}} career remained that of Lord Foppington in The Relapse, a sequel to Cibber's own Love's Last Shift but written by John Vanbrugh, first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington. Pope mentions the audience jubilation that greeted the small-framed Cibber donning Lord Foppington's enormous wig, which would be ceremoniously carried on stage in its own sedan chair. Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately [...] "to suit the eccentricities of Cibber's acting style".|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross asked Engraver Sinnock {{to produce}} a design for a half dollar {{featuring}} Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. Ross had long been an admirer of Franklin, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> on a coin. [...] Mint officials had considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941, but the project was shelved owing to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II. [...] During the war, the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design {{in anticipation of a}} new issue, which did not occur. [...] In 1946, the Treasury replaced the Mercury dime with a piece depicting the recently deceased president, Franklin Roosevelt, who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes. [...] With the Lincoln cent popular and politically inexpedient to replace, the half dollar was the only piece being struck which was available for redesign without congressional permission. [...] The Treasury approved the new design. [...] Although Sinnock died before the coin was issued, the Franklin half dollar went into production at the start of 1948, ending the Walking Liberty series. [...] A total of 485,320,340 Walking Liberty half dollars were struck.|$|E

2500|$|Pius XI {{was known}} to have a temper at times and was someone who had {{a keen sense of}} {{knowledge}} and dignity of the office he held. He insisted that he ate alone with no one around him and would not allow his assistants or any other priests of other clergy to dine with him. He would frequently meet with political figures but would always greet them seated. He insisted that when his brother and sister <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> they had to refer to him as [...] "Your Holiness" [...] and book an appointment.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{identity}} was made public, people sent him care packages, including lots of cigarettes; President George W. Bush sent cigars, candy and memorabilia from the White House.

Natonski, made a special trip to see Miller, to Miller's surprise. The general shook Miller's hand {{and let him}} know that, because Americans had [...] "connected" [...] with his photo, and nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> wounded or dead, he was offered a trip home. Miller turned down the offer because {{he did not want to}} leave his comrades behind.|$|E
2500|$|Ned Kelly, {{in company}} with a Mr Living and Constable Richards went to the {{printing}} office. S.

[...] Living said, [...] "For God's sake, Kelly, give me the papers, and I will give them to Gill." [...] (Living never carried out his promise and handed the document to the police instead who published it in a distorted form after Kelly's execution.)
