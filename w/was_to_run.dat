5|$|What is now Route55 was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road to Cape May {{was turned over to}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route55, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Westville to Cape May Court House. The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s. Route55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The {{alignment}} of today’s Route 124 was first {{designated as a}} part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current {{alignment of}} Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.|$|E

5|$|The present-day routing of Route 20 {{north of}} Market Street was legislated in 1927 {{as part of}} Route 3, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from the New York border at Greenwood Lake to Secaucus. In addition, the present day routing south of Route 4 was also legislated {{as part of that}} route, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from the George Washington Bridge to Cape May. In 1929, the western {{terminus}} of Route 3 was moved to Paterson as Route S4B (now Route 208) was planned to replace the alignment of Route 3 from Paterson to the New York border. McLean Boulevard through Paterson was built by the 1930s. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 20 was legislated to follow the former alignment of Route 3 between Paterson and East Rutherford as Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway that was built between East Rutherford and Clifton.|$|E
5|$|What {{would become}} I-195 was first {{proposed}} in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway {{that was to be}} operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority, the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time. In 1965, this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System. The western portion would {{become a part of the}} Route 37 freeway that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would become a part of the Route 38 freeway that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Camden to Belmar. The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix. By 1967, plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled, leaving Route 37 as the only planned east-west freeway through central New Jersey. The routing of this freeway, which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway, was changed to run from the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition, officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway, with funds to be diverted from the canceled I-278 in Union County. The proposed freeway would cost $60 million.|$|E

5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E
5|$|As the stadium's {{construction}} got underway, the NFL {{began to}} search for an owner for the team, which the league decided would be an expansion franchise March 23, 1998. A litany of potential owners lined up, including Kosar and a group backed partly by HBO founder Charles Dolan, comedian Bill Cosby and former Miami coach Don Shula. The ultimate winner was Al Lerner, the Baltimore man who had helped Modell in 1986 by buying a small stake in the Browns. A seven-member NFL expansion committee awarded the team to Lerner for $530 million in September 1998. Lerner, then 65 years old, had a majority share, while Carmen Policy, who helped build the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, owned 10% of the team and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> football operations.|$|E

5|$|During the {{unsuccessful}} {{attack of}} the 5th Cavalry Division on Nazareth {{in the early morning}} of 20 September, the commander of the Yildirim Army Group commanding three Ottoman armies, Generalleutnant (comparable to a British Major General) Otto Liman von Sanders escaped to Damascus, travelling via Tiberias, Samakh and Deraa. He alerted the garrisons he passed to the advance of the EEF and ordered the establishment of a rearguard line. The line <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Deraa down the Yarmuk River Valley, across the Jordan River and west to Samakh, around the shore of the Sea of Galilee to Tiberias and northwards to Lake Huleh. Two main roads and the railway lines to Damascus, would be protected and time gained {{for the development of the}} defence of Damascus, if the garrisons were not defeated. Von Sanders and three senior Yildirim Army Group staff officers reached Tiberias during the afternoon of 20 September.|$|E

The CLR <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> in a pair of tunnels under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, Cheapside, and Poultry.

It was then to run under Haymarket, Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue before passing under the River Thames to Waterloo station. A decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains.|$|E
