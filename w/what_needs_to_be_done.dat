The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.

5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
500|$|Isabella Acres as Rose Crisp: Rose is Ted's preteen daughter. She {{attends the}} Veridian Dynamics daycare program when her nanny is not available, but prefers {{to stay at}} home. According to Ted, [...] "her mom ran off to Africa to go save the world." [...] She is often the voice of reason on the show. When Ted talks with her about work she points out the terrible choices the company makes, and often helps Ted focus on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to set things straight. She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E
500|$|Sociology {{and applied}} {{sociology}} {{are connected to}} the professional and academic discipline of social work. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty. The applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on action; implementing theses strategies [...] "directly" [...] or [...] "indirectly" [...] by means of mental health therapy, counselling, advocacy, community organization or community mobilization.|$|E

500|$|Bach {{wrote the}} cantata in 1723 {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for the 13th Sunday after Trinity. The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's teaching on law and promise (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Good Samaritan (...) [...] The cantata text was written by Johann Oswald Knauer and appeared in Gotha in 1720 in [...] (Holy singing and playing to God). The text relates closely to the readings, even to the situation in which the parable was told, referring to the question of a lawyer <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to achieve eternal life. The answer, which the lawyer had to give himself, was the commandment to love God and your neighbour. This, the Great Commandment, is the text of the first movement. Accordingly, the following text is divided in two parts, one recitative and aria dealing with the love of God, and a symmetrical part handling the love of the neighbour.|$|E
500|$|Conker's {{abilities}} are far simpler {{than those of}} previous Rare platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Conker also has a few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, climb ladders or ropes, and {{is strong enough to}} push heavy objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of [...] "anti-gravity" [...] Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the [...] "B" [...] button atop them. For instance, {{in the beginning of the}} game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on. They also serve to inform players of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> next.|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
