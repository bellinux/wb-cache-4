During the Third Carlist War of 1872–76 Thétis, Reine Blanche and Jeanne d'Arc spent time in Spanish waters where they could protect French {{citizens}} and interests. In 1875, the latter ship rammed and sank the dispatch vessel Forfait. On 3 July 1877 Thétis rammed Reine Blanche <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run ashore to prevent her from sinking.|$|E
5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 seconds left in the game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn't get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 seconds left in the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ardabil {{was a major}} shock to the Muslims, who {{for the first time}} faced an enemy {{penetrating}} so deep within the borders of the Caliphate, and Caliph Hisham appointed the veteran military leader Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi to take command against the Khazars. Although the forces he could muster immediately (including refugees from Ardabil <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid ten gold dinars to be persuaded to fight) were small, Sa'id managed to recover Akhlat on Lake Van. From there he moved northeast to Bardha'a and south again to relieve the siege of Warthan. Near Bajarwan Sa'id came upon a 10,000-strong Khazar army, which he defeated, killing most of the Khazars, and rescuing the prisoners they had with them. The surviving Khazars fled north, with Sa'id in pursuit. Despite this success, Sa'id was relieved of his command in early 731 and even imprisoned for a while {{as a result of the}} jealousy of Maslama, whom Hisham re-appointed as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan. Maslama came to the Caucasus with many Jaziran troops and took to the offensive. He restored the provinces of Albania to Muslim allegiance through exemplary punishment of those who resisted his advance, and reached Derbent, where he found a Khazar garrison. Bypassing the fortress, Maslama advanced north, following the retreating Khazars. Although the details of this campaign in the sources may be confused with that of 728, it appears that he took Khamzin, Balanjar, and Samandar before being forced to retreat again after a confrontation with the khagan himself, in which Barjik was reportedly killed and the khagan wounded. The Khazars shadowed Maslama's march south and attacked him near Derbent, but the Arab army dug a trench and defeated them. Taking advantage of his victory, Maslama evicted the Khazars from Derbent by poisoning their water supply and re-founded the city as a military colony, garrisoning it with 24,000 mostly Syrian troops. After that he returned with the rest of his army (mostly the favoured Jaziran and Qinnasrini contingents) south of the Caucasus for the winter, while the Khazars re-occupied their abandoned towns. Despite the capture of Derbent, Maslama's record was apparently unsatisfactory for Hisham, who replaced his brother in March 732 with Marwan ibn Muhammad, who would later reign as the last Umayyad caliph in 744–750.|$|E
