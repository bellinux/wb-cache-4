500|$|The story {{revolves}} around Costner's Jim Garrison, {{with a large}} cast of well-known actors in supporting roles. Stone {{was inspired by the}} casting model of the documentary epic The Longest Day, which he had admired as a child: [...] "It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars... the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that <b>walk</b> <b>you</b> through a winding path in the dark woods." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't <b>walk,</b> <b>you</b> don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie in bed at night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow shoeing – A snowshoe is {{footwear}} {{for walking}} over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing {{the weight of}} the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called [...] "flotation". It is often said by snowshoers that if you can <b>walk,</b> <b>you</b> can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing [...] "straddle-gait" [...] that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.|$|E
