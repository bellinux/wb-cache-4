500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elements of {{the album}} dated back {{to the end of}} the songwriting process for the {{previous}} album, Given to the Rising. Scott Kelly explained that the band continued to [...] "overwrite and then start subtracting ...As far back as I can remember, there's always been an initial sort of reflection on where we were with the previous record and what we feel like doing, where <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> could be better. [...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves to that kind of tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E
2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would be ridiculous for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> can do anything. We have to go {{at least one more}} round with him. I think we just scratched the surface of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E

On March 28, the Orioles optioned Stern to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Norfolk vice president Jim Duquette noted, [...] "With Stern, <b>we</b> didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> {{had the opportunity to}} see an awful lot of him, and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he needs more time down in the minor leagues.

Obuchowski explained: [...] "It’s not right that Goes Cube would just fade away, like, oh, they must not be doing anything anymore. <b>We</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> need to make this next album (and whatever shows we do to support it) our best yet, and our final statement." ...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Blowout Comb, Digable Planets disbanded in early 1995 due to the passing away of Mecca's parents, {{creative}} differences, and displeasure with the music industry. Ishmael Buttler remarked [...] "we got into the music business {{at a time when it}} still had to be original; it was more about the music. Then it started to be more economic, more material, and that disillusioned us. Being young and everything <b>like</b> that, <b>we</b> just sort of copped out. Because we weren’t really the industry types; it wasn’t really like that for us, so <b>we</b> didn’t <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were losing out on things."

5000|$|There {{were many}} {{unfinished}} ideas that the pair fiddled with and then abandoned, but it wasn't until sometime in 2012 that things really came together, {{when they stopped}} the loop-based and software- approach common in modern dance music and switched to Karlsson's usual method of beginning a song on guitar or piano. The duo figured out their own approach—once they create a foundation with a simple arrangement, they build it up with stirring keyboards, monumental drums, imploring vocals and inventive flourishes. [...] "We keep the song naked, and when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> have the right one, we put some clothes on it {{and see how it}} feels," [...] says Karlsson.|$|E

It was the last song written for the album, being penned during the nine-month {{recording}} cycle. According to its composer Roger Hodgson, the song deals with how the desire to go home can go both ways:I'm talking about not wanting {{to go home to}} the wife, take the long way home to the wife because she treats you like part of the furniture, but there's a deeper level to the song, too. I really believe we all want to find our home, find that place in us where <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> at home, and to me, home is in the heart and that is really, when we are in touch with our heart and we're living our life from our heart, then <b>we</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> found our home." ...|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though we}} know that collaborations like this are almost always {{commercial}} in motivation, we like {{to imagine that the}} artist's choice of a creative partner gives us some kind of access to their private, emotional world. Collaboration suggests a personal relationship, and our eavesdropping on that interplay conjures up a feeling of intimacy between audience and artist that is very powerful. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> know what's really going on with Rihanna and Chris Brown because we are virtually present in the studio with them, and here, the thing we're meant to know is that everything's OK now.

For the inhabitants of Overvecht, a potential source is the community of the neighbourhood. In this thesis, I have provided an insight into female inhabitant’s experiences of community and community building projects in the social-culturally diverse, Dutch neighbourhood Overvecht (Utrecht). I have shown that both gender and ethnicity play influential roles in this. Regarding these experiences, I have concluded that there is a discrepancy between the point of view and interests of the inhabitants and the point of view and interests of the municipality regarding community and the neighbourhood. Participants tend to prioritise family and ethnicity, while the municipality has an interests in social cohesion of the community as a whole...|$|R
