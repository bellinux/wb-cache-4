These mentioned families should manage the crisis, but successful managing of this situation can be very strengthening element. The families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child manifest in different way than the families with healthy children, because the birth of child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> intervenes {{the peace of the}} whole family. This fact can remark the family even this way, which the physical problems can appear by the parents or they can incline to risk change of their behaviour. The parents? roles also could change and exists also risk, that brothers and sister of child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> can follow contacts with difficulties. These families have their own particularity, because the birth of child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> means great stress for these families. The theoretic part of this work pays attention to <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> and its classification. Further are the welfare services available, which can families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child use of. It is not also left out the role of family, the importance of parental roles and brotherly and sisterly constellation. I describe style of upbringing and further I concern the particularity of family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child in my dissertation likewise the role of brother and sister by the child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability.</b> There are also stages of acceptance with the diagnosis of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> and risk behaviour of parents these children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> as results of managing critical situation described and the related physical problems. The target of dissertation is finding out if exists diametrically differences between parental roles by the care about <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child and the healthy child. The intermediate target is finding out if the families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child are more predisposed to a presence of social pathological syndromes. The theory expects following fact that the care for <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child has provided by overall in majority by mothers. Families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child incline to risk change of their behaviour than by the families with the healthy child. Brothers and sisters of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child do less friendly relationships than of the healthy children. The approach to quantitative study was used at all. The strategy of questionnaire: The questionnaire inquiry was performed by the 20 families with healthy children and by the 20 families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child. The filled questionnaires had evaluated using the elementary statistics of software programmes SPSS and Excel. I found out more conflicting relationships between brothers and sisters in the families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child than in the families with healthy children. Brothers and sisters of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child care more about their mental disability brother or sister than the elder brothers and sisters care about their younger ones. Likewise the brothers and sisters <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> brother or sister have less friendly relationships than the children with healthy brothers and sisters. Families with healthy children enjoy more harmonious parental care than by the families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child and mainly mothers do it. The grandparents act on behalf of parents with healthy children more often than in the families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child, there exists often absence caring grandparents. The same is the fact that both compared families models using mostly democratic style of upbringing.

During the following ten days of competition, the stadium hosted the track and field events and all the rugby sevens matches. Sixteen new Commonwealth Games track and field records (six men's and ten women's) were set in the stadium, eight of which (three men's and five women's records) are still extant after three subsequent series of Games in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London, the 2002 Games was the largest multi-sport event ever to be staged in the United Kingdom, eclipsing the earlier London 1948 Summer Olympics in numbers of teams and competing athletes (3,679), {{and it was the}} world's first multi-sport tournament to include a limited number of full medal events for elite athletes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>disability</b> (EAD).

Students <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> and their parents found that the support services had no real influence on students’ abilities to solve problems, or on their social and family lives. Teachers, on the contrary, considered that students’ problem-solving skills had been helped by the support given, their social lives to a more limited extent and their family lives were not influenced by the support. According to students <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> and their teachers, the support influenced the academic lives of students positively; however, parents considered a limited influence of the support on this aspect as well.

This cardiac plasticity has been studied intensively and {{is well known in}} trained athletes. Conversely, the mechanisms leading to the opposite response are less clear. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate left ventricular (LV) dimensions in a physically inactive population of adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability.</b> MethodsAdults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> <b>with</b> and without Down syndrome (DS) and healthy controls were included (n= 182). Echocardiography was performed in all included subjects and physical activity was measured by means of a questionnaire. ResultsPhysical activity was lower in adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> compared to controls (p< 0. 001). In DS, iLVM was significantly lower compared to controls (64 ± 17 g/m 2 vs. 94 ± 17 g/m 2 p< 0. 001). Non-DS adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> had higher iLVM (72 ± 16 g/m 2) compared to subjects with DS, although not significantly different (p< 0. 08). LV volumes were significantly smaller in adults with DS compared to both controls and non-DS adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> (p< 0. 001). Moderate diastolic dysfunction was found in 57 % of the adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability.</b> In 48 children with DS and 79 controls, mean LV end diastolic diameter was not significantly different during childhood. ConclusionsLV dimensions are significantly smaller in adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> compared to controls. These findings appear to be lifestyle related as differences become manifest at adulthood and adults <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual <b>disability</b> generally experience <b>a</b> sedentary lifestyle.
