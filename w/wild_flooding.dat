A sample of 220 tertiary channels was drawn randomly to get information from the growers of the Mirpurkhas subdivision, Jamrao canal irrigation scheme. Pre and post soil moisture status based practical measurements of losses were also carried out at 20 different sites. The results showed that the irrigation methods and soil types have a pronounced effect on application losses whereas crop type has no effect on application efficiency. Drip, sprinkler and furrow irrigation methods showed better performance as compared to other methods (<b>wild</b> <b>flooding,</b> border and basin) used in the study area. The survey based losses results were validated against measured losses whilst values available in literature compared favorably. The overall application losses in the study area were calculated as 23 %. The main assumption for the irrigation survey of knowing the irrigation depth (not target depth in accordance with crop actual demand) and cutoff time for a single irrigation event by farmers was almost fulfilled. Based on the encouraging results of this study, it is concluded that irrigation survey studies are useful in understanding the irrigation scheme losses pattern which in turn provide opportunities for improvement...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at South Island Dairy Event (SIDE) conference, 5 - 7 July 1999, Christchurch. Irrigation {{has been a}} frequently discussed subject in New Zealand for many years. A book called Practical Irrigation was written by John McKeague and published in Ashburton in 1899, 100 years ago. Although there were some small developments in irrigation from that time, it wasn't until the 1930 s that state-funded irrigation schemes progressed {{as we know them}} today. All of the early schemes were surface water irrigation schemes - border strip irrigation and <b>wild</b> <b>flooding.</b> Spray irrigation was introduced on private schemes in the 1960 s and later on into some of the state-funded schemes. However, even in the early 1980 s the majority of the new schemes utilised border strip irrigation. The interesting thing about these developments is that the surface water irrigation systems were often constructed on soils that were likely to result in low water use efficiency. In fact, in some of the later schemes, provision was made for drainage to prevent water-logging of farms at the bottom of schemes. Using water efficiently {{did not appear to be}} high priority. The situation is changing rapidly. Irrigation efficiency is one of the key issues facing irrigation farmers and water managers in New Zealand. The general population is now much more environmentally aware than in the past and sees inefficient water use as a threat to environmental sustainability. Farmers may be forced to irrigate efficiently by being allocated water on an efficient basis. To maintain access to water, there will also be more pressure on farmers to demonstrate that they are using water effectively and efficiently. On most of the irrigated dairy farms in the South Island, irrigation is a necessary part of the farming enterprise, because without irrigation, dairy farming would not be viable in these areas. Maintaining access to water, therefore, is vital...|$|E
40|$|Irrigation is the {{application}} of water to soil {{for the purpose of}} supplying moisture necessary for the growth of a crop. Irrigation has been practiced since the beginning of civilization and its importance in the present world is well recognized as a means of developing a profitable agriculture. The rapid growth in the world population and the consequent need for additional food supplies are making irrigation absolutely necessary in the world today. In surface irrigation by flooding, two general methods are used; uncontrolled flooding or controlled flooding. In irrigating by uncontrolled flooding, or <b>wild</b> <b>flooding,</b> water is applied to an area which has undergone no prior land preparation. In most cases, this unsystematic method produces inefficient irrigation. Low spots in the field are over-irrigated whereas high areas are under-irrigated. In the controlled flooding method, predetermined rates and quantities of water are applied to areas which have been prepared for irrigation. This method of irrigation includes border dyke, border ditch, and border check systems. For proper design of these systems, the size of stream is balanced against the intake rate of the soil, the total depth of water to be stored in the root zone, and the area to be covered by the stream. With the completion of the South Saskatchewan Dam, it is expected that the irrigated acreage of the province will increase substantially. Further, it is expected that most of the new area coming under irrigation will be irrigated by some surface irrigation method. One of the most common and diversified of the surface irrigation methods, which is adaptable to both close growing and row crops, is the border dyke or border strip method. In this method, water is introduced to land which is bounded by low, flat levees or dykes which extend {{in the direction of the}} steepest slope. The present procedures used in design of border dyke systems 2. are empirical. The experimental data reported in the literature were obtained from systems whose soils, topography and other conditions differ widely from those which will be encountered in the South Saskatchewan River Development Project. Thus, it is questionable whether these data can be applied directly to the design of systems in Saskatchewan. There is a great need for experimental data from systems installed on areas which are similar to those that will be encountered under the proposed project. The study reported in this thesis was undertaken in an attempt to satisfy some of these needs. Experimental data collected from existing border dyke systems located in Saskatchewan are presented. In addition, a rational approach for evaluating several factors affecting the design of these systems for example, soil intake rate, is given...|$|E

By focusing on the period following the catastrophic August 17, 1999 earthquake, the study benefits from USAID’s Disaster Risk Management Benchmarking Tool (DRMBT). In line with the benchmarking tool, the paper covers key developments in the four components of pre-disaster risk management, namely: risk identification, risk mitigation, risk transfer and disaster preparedness. In the end, it will present three major conclusions: (i) Although post- 1999 Turkey has made some important progress in the pre-disaster phase of DRM, particularly with the enactment of obligatory earthquake insurance and tightened standards for building construction, the country is far away from substantial levels of success in DRM. (ii) In recent years, local governments have had been given more authority in the realm of DRM, however, Turkey’s approach to DRM is still predominantly centralized at the expense of successful DRM practices at the local level.

This village belongs to another major type of village community in Cambodia, that of the traditional subsistence rice farmers. These communities are scattered through the lower and upper plains, and consist of farming groups who cultivate rain-fed or irrigated rice paddies. They tend to live in small family groups or villages. In general, each family also cultivates a field where rice, cucumbers, occasionally corn, and other vegetables are grown. Usually {{a number of different}} traditional varieties of rice are grown, each one adapted to different soil types and water conditions. The farmers use animal fertilizers and traditional farming techniques, such as the swing plow pulled by oxen or buffalo. Houses are generally made of bamboo and straw thatch, and are typically raised on stilts to reduce dampness and increase ventilation, as well as to provide protection from <b>wild</b> animals and <b>flooding.</b> The fact that the houses in this village are not raised indicates that it may be located higher in the upland plains or that the family is very poor.
