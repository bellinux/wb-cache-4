5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E

25|$|When Agnes Fletcher, a maid in Morley's apartment, {{admits to}} having seen Carter {{on the stairs}} going down to Morley's office, it seems that Carter {{is likely to be}} tried and convicted of both the murder and the {{attempted}} murder. The fact that the gun with which he was captured was the twin of the murder weapon only makes things worse for him. At the climax of the novel Poirot realises that by allowing Carter to persist in his lies he can ensure that the real killer goes free, and <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> his conscience. Eventually he presses Carter to admit the truth: that he had seen two people leave Morley's surgery, and that when he entered it the dentist was already dead. This is the final element in the puzzle.|$|E

Aura vies with Artemis in a beauty contest, and Artemis, in spite, has Nemesis make Dionysus {{fall in love with}} Aura and pursue her. Ariadne appears to Dionysus in a dream and complains that he has forgotten her. Dionysus rapes Aura as she sleeps; when she awakes she goes mad and slaughters shepherds and destroys a shrine of Aphrodite. Artemis mocks the pregnant Aura as Nicaea helps her give birth to the twins after whom Mt. Dindymon is named. Aura tries to get a lion to eat the children, but they are saved and she is transformed into a spring. One of the children, Iacchus is given to Athena, Ariadne's crown is made a constellation, and Dionysus is enthroned on Olympus.|$|E

[...] Guitar World included the performance as the magazine's featured solo in June 2011.

[...] HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that [...] "even the more subdued songs like [...] "She" [...] with Frank Ocean" [...] embody [...] "Tyler’s middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and “stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus” into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism." ...|$|E

She questions her faith (another theme {{that runs through the}} novel), and begins to develop a sense of self apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E

Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring is that it is also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E

Wandering the globe with Russian gangsters, Clark is eventually found and rescued by Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) and John Jones, with the latter restoring Clarks powers. During season eight, Clark uses his new job at the Daily Planet to access advance information, which he uses to stop crime around the city. In subsequent episodes, Clark adopts the name [...] "Red-Blue Blur" [...] as his superhero moniker. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Clark <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> the idea of having to kill Davis Bloome (Sam Witwer), a new friend, after discovering that Davis is actually Doomsday, a genetically engineered creature created by General Zod to kill Clark and destroy Earth. In the season eight finale, Clark finds a way to separate Davis' personality from that of Doomsday, and buries Doomsday a mile underground. When Davis subsequently kills Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore), Clark decides that his human-learned emotions have caused him the most trouble, as it was his compassion for Davis that led to Jimmy's death.

The 'impossible' thing {{they are trying to}} do is living according to God's standards in modern society. Megan gets the lead in the high school play, but her character is a rather 'loose' woman.

2500|$|Conservative Rabbi Milton Steinberg fictionalized {{the life}} of Elisha ben Abuyah in his {{controversial}} 1939 novel, As A Driven Leaf. Steinberg's novel <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> the 2nd century Jewish struggle to reconcile Rabbinic Judaism both culturally and philosophically with Greek Hellenistic society. In Elisha's struggle, Steinberg speculates about questions and events that may have driven such a man to apostasy, and addresses questions of Jewish self-determination in the Roman Empire, the Bar Kochba Revolt (132-135), and above all the interdependence of reason and faith. Although the novel draws on Talmudic tradition to create the framework for Elisha's life, Steinberg himself wrote that his novel [...] "springs from historical data without any effort at rigid conformity or literal confinement to them." [...] (Steinberg, As A Driven Leaf, 480, [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The Rick Rubin-produced fourth track [...] "Don't You Remember," [...] co-written by Adele and Dan Wilson, marks a {{shift in}} the album's theme, from anger and defensiveness to {{reflection}} and heartbreak. A downtempo country music-styled ballad, the song was added late to the production of the album after the singer grew ashamed of her continued negative portrayal of her ex-lover throughout the album. Its lyrics entreat a past lover to remember the happier moments {{at the beginning of a}} now broken relationship. In [...] "Set Fire to the Rain" [...] the singer delineates the conflicting stages of a troubled union and <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> her inability to fully let go. Accentuated by ornate orchestral flourishes, swirling strings, crescendos, and dramatic vocal effects towards its climactic end, the song stands in stark contrast to the otherwise understated production of the album, and in reviews, was characterised by critics as a pop rock power ballad. To achieve a fuller sound, producer Fraser T Smith incorporated the popular [...] "wall of sound" [...] reverberative technique in framing the song's dense instrumentation.|$|E

2500|$|The album's themes {{primarily}} {{revolve around}} fame, sex, and empowerment, whilst briefly exploring gender roles and marijuana. References include Greek and Roman mythology, and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra. Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic saw Artpop as an [...] "attention-freak's manifesto", and interpreted the record's exploration into carnal desire as a {{facet of the}} broader idea of [...] "owning up to one's own desire for attention". London Evening Standard John Aizlewood suggested that songs such as [...] "Do What U Want" [...] and [...] "Dope" [...] highlighted Gaga's [...] "curiously submissive" [...] tendencies as a lyricist. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard commented that Artpop [...] "naturally abides" [...] to her [...] "far-reaching ambition" [...] to [...] "re-think the 'pop album' as an entity", while USA Today Jerry Shiver observed the lyrics to foretell [...] "the exploits of an empowered, sexy siren who <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> fame", something he expected from Gaga. John Pareles from The New York Times argued that with Artpop, the singer reasserted [...] "her need {{for the love of}} her audience and announced her new pivot to align herself with the [...] art world".|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{profound}} {{shifts in the}} agricultural practices of the United States, and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life, {{are some of the}} major concerns of the Port William fiction, though the theme is often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what [...] "a human economy … conducted with reverence" [...] looked like in the past—and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be evoked by such an economy were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community, under the influence of expanding post-World War II agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In A Place on Earth (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, we see how not only Mat but the entire community <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> the acute costs of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the novel, {{characters}} are often faced with decisions that match one redeemable trait against another. The Guardian outlines characters who are frequently [...] "forced {{to choose between}} their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm." [...] In Westeros, Ned ultimately decides to venture south with Robert, leaving much of his family in Winterfell. At the Wall, Jon <b>wrestles</b> <b>with</b> the predicament of joining his half-brother Robb in rebellion or staying with his sworn brothers in the Night's Watch. Daenerys has issue with the Dothraki treatment of those they conquered in Essos. These conflicts characters encounter oftentimes reflect inconsistent decision making. Catelyn initially is overwhelmed by grief and does not leave Bran's bedside while he is comatose, ignoring her political responsibilities, choosing family over duty. But soon after, Catelyn leaves Bran and her family for Kings Landing to inform Ned of potential Lannister treason, effectively displaying a more duty fulfilling role. Family, duty, and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc, and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution. Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy.|$|E
