5|$|Waddington {{was less}} {{effective}} in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he slipped on <b>wet</b> <b>grass</b> {{when he was}} about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.|$|E
25|$|A natural pitch {{with grass}} longer or more moist than usual is {{described}} as a green pitch or green seamer. This favours the bowler over the batsman as the ball can be made to behave erratically on longer or <b>wet</b> <b>grass.</b> Most club and social cricket is played on pitches that professional cricketers would call green.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, he was penalised five grid {{places for}} failing to slow down for yellow flags after Sébastien Buemi crashed, {{scattering}} debris onto the track. The R29's pace was again disappointing, when he could only manage to climb up to 10th from 16th place on the grid, despite a late safety car period after Jaime Alguersuari crashed heavily. Alonso said that his race was pretty much decided in qualifying, although he admitted that his car seemed to be fairly competitive. In Brazil however, he retired on the first lap when Adrian Sutil and Jarno Trulli collided, and Alonso was unable to avoid the out-of-control Force India, which had spun onto the <b>wet</b> <b>grass,</b> terminally damaging a sidepod on Alonso's car, forcing him to retire.|$|E

60|$|Jean {{paused a}} few moments, and then struck into a green path which led through the wood. The path wound beneath dark pines; their topmost branches, were {{red in the}} evening light, but the shade was black beneath them. Soon the path reached a little grassy glade, and there among cold, <b>wet</b> <b>grasses</b> was the Wishing Well. It was almost hidden by the grass, and looked very black, and cool, and deep. A tiny trickle of water flowed out of it, flowed down to join the Yarrow. The trees about it had scraps of rags and other things pinned to them, offerings made by the country people to {{the spirits of the}} well.|$|R
50|$|Seasonal {{patterns}} {{described by}} Fletcher and Anderson (1972) generalize annual movements from freshwater to estuaries and coastal bays to feed during spring, then either a return {{during the fall}} to overwinter (juvenile and immature adults), or a southward migration to the spawning grounds (silver eels Continental phase eels appear highly plastic in habitat use. Eels are extremely mobile and may access habitats that appear unavailable to them, using small watercourses or moving through <b>wet</b> <b>grasses.</b> Small eels (<100 mm total length) are able to climb and may succeed in passing over vertical barriers. Habitat availability may be reduced by factors such as habitat deterioration, barriers to upstream migration (larger eels), and barriers (i.e. turbines) to downstream migration that can result in mortality.|$|R
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented <b>wet</b> <b>grass)</b> is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
25|$|In the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is {{also found}} to nest in low, thick-trunked trees {{including}} Ficus pertusa and Randia venezuelansis. These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2cm in diameter, and often from the palm species Copernicia tectorum. Nevertheless, the species {{does not seem to}} naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the jabiru, it cannot stand on its hallux. Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground. The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years. However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest. Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding. Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and lining material largely consists of <b>wet</b> <b>grass</b> that dries and hardens in the intense sun.|$|E
25|$|As {{the safety}} car was exiting turn 11, an {{approaching}} Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 drastically reduced its speed {{in response to}} the unusually slow safety car. However, a BMW a few seconds behind came around the blind turn at speed, colliding with the Gallardo and safety car. The collision destroyed the Gallardo and sent the BMW into a number of rolls. The safety car was sent off the track into the Armco at great speed. In the chaos, a Marcos LM600 coming around turn 11 locked up its brakes and spun into the <b>wet</b> <b>grass</b> {{on the inside of the}} track. Sliding back onto the track, it was hit from the side by a BMW Z3. Furthermore, two E46 BMW M3 GTRs were damaged: one on the outside line hit the rear of the Marcos, and the other, on the inside line, slightly damaged its front right. The second M3 continued around the track, while the first slid into the grass before turn 12. The race was stopped, and there were no serious injuries to any of the drivers.|$|E

500|$|In spring training, {{while he}} was batting [...]400, Kinsler slipped {{on a patch of}} <b>wet</b> <b>grass</b> during pre-game warm-ups. He rolled his right ankle, and {{suffered}} a sprain of the ligaments above it (referred to as a [...] "high ankle sprain"), as well as a small bone bruise at the tip of his tibia {{at the back of his}} ankle. He missed three weeks of spring training, and began the season on the disabled list. Washington said: [...] "We miss his presence. We miss his threat. We miss what he brings on the defensive end.

500|$|After the injury, Milwaukee's {{general manager}} Harry Dalton said that Bates [...] "is {{expected}} to join [...] by game time [...] ", adding [...] "he won't {{be in the}} starting lineup, but he could play if necessary". Bates made his MLB debut on August 17 {{as a part of}} a double switch against the Boston Red Sox: when Dan Plesac replaced Tony Fossas as the pitcher, Bates entered the game for Gus Polidor. Wade Boggs hit a ground ball to Bates, but he committed an error that allowed Boggs to reach and Dwight Evans to advance to third base. No runs were scored in the inning and the Brewers won, 8–4. Bates made his first career start two days later, and his first MLB hit came on August 20 when he reached base on an infield single. Bates then stole second base, and scored on a single by Robin Yount. While he was running out a base hit on August 22, Bates slipped on <b>wet</b> <b>grass</b> and suffered a separated right shoulder. The Brewers placed him on the 15-day DL; as a replacement, Milwaukee acquired Ed Romero from the Atlanta Braves. Bates returned to the team for three more games in September before the end of the season. Over seven MLB games, he batted [...]214 with three hits, three runs, and two steals.|$|E

50|$|The Skokie River was {{traditionally}} a wetland {{river that}} flowed very slowly through a valley {{left behind by}} two parallel sand dunes that bordered Lake Michigan.

40|$|The master's thesis {{interprets the}} {{delicate}} passage that links reality and fiction in Pierre Perrault's film The Shimmering Beast. Literary and philosophical modes of investigation {{are used to}} decode the principal traps of this "reality" hunting, interlaced with words and images. What exists beyond the horizon, beyond the threshold that sends us adrift towards the imaginary? Imagination fills the void in the wait, and becomes more difficult to understand than the beast itself. In the act of waiting that transpires in the scene where the novice hunters of the Shimmering Beast attempt to lure the animal towards them, reality transforms itself, and becomes charged with nervousness and apprehension. The edge of the woods, a natural frontier, becomes through analogy, the screen that separates man from animal, fiction from life. Fantasized by man, the coveted animal metamorphoses into an "image of possibility" into a seemingly divine apparition, yet remains invisible to the eye. Lying low in a cramped space, kneeling in the <b>wet</b> <b>grasses</b> {{in the heart of}} the forest, silence reigns; the hunter waits. In this space of waiting, the manifolds of silence are proportionally in correlation with the fear and the desire sensed by the hunters. The layout of these scenes resonates with the fictitious constructs of film, which projects its most enticing lures...|$|R
