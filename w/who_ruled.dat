5|$|Offa's ancestry {{is given}} in the Anglian collection, a set of genealogies that include lines of descent for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from Pybba, <b>who</b> <b>ruled</b> Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa's line descends through Pybba's son Eowa and then through three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa's father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, <b>who</b> <b>ruled</b> Mercia {{for most of the}} forty years before Offa, was also descended from Eowa {{according}} to the genealogies: Offa's grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald's first cousin. Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald's brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.|$|E
