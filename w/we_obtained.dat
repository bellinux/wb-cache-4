60|$|But {{enough of}} this, too. Through the unremitting efforts of Polish friends <b>we</b> <b>obtained</b> {{at last the}} {{permission}} to travel to Vienna. Once there, the wing of the American Eagle was extended over our uneasy heads. We cannot be sufficiently grateful to the American Ambassador (who, all along, interested himself in our fate) for his exertions on our behalf, his invaluable assistance and the real friendliness of his reception in Vienna. Owing to Mr. Penfield's action <b>we</b> <b>obtained</b> the permission to leave Austria. And it was a near thing, for his Excellency has informed my American publishers since that a week later orders were issued to have us detained {{till the end of}} the war. However, we effected our hair's- breadth escape into Italy; and, reaching Genoa, took passage in a Dutch mail steamer, homeward-bound from Java with London as a port of call.|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} that this event happened, there was {{at the same time}} a {{concurrence}} of other events, which, from this partial and momentary weakness, displayed the strength of Great Britain in Asia. For some years before, the French and English troops began, on the coast of Coromandel, to exhibit the power, force, and efficacy of European discipline. As we daily looked for a war with France, our settlements on that coast were in some degree armed. Lord Pigot, then Governor of Madras,--Lord Pigot, the preserver and the victim of the British dominion in Asia,--detached such of the Company's force as could he collected and spared, and such of his Majesty's ships as were on that station, to the assistance of Calcutta. And--to hasten this history to its conclusion--the daring and commanding genius of Clive, the patient and firm ability of Watson, the treachery of Mir Jaffier, and the battle of Plassey gave us at once the patronage of a kingdom and the command of all its treasures. We negotiated with Mir Jaffier for the viceroyal throne of his master. On that throne we seated him. And <b>we</b> <b>obtained,</b> on our part, immense sums of money. <b>We</b> <b>obtained</b> a million sterling for the Company, upwards of a million for individuals, in the whole a sum of about two millions two hundred and thirty thousand pounds for various purposes, from the prince whom we had set up. <b>We</b> <b>obtained,</b> too, the town of Calcutta more completely than we had before possessed it, and the twenty-four districts adjoining. This was the first small seminal principle of the immense territorial acquisitions we have since made in India.|$|E
60|$|I {{suggested}} that there was one sub-officer, or employé, {{that we should be}} sure to need, and who should be appointed before we commenced operations. This was an emissary. Proper communications between ourselves and the populace would be difficult, unless <b>we</b> <b>obtained</b> the service of some intelligent and whole-souled darkey. My fellow-revolutionists agreed with me, and, after a moment of reflection, Corny shouted that she had thought of the very person.|$|E

60|$|The doctor's wish was granted.

60|$|Notwithstanding {{the regular}} {{supply of food}} which <b>we</b> <b>obtained</b> from Captain Bob and his friends, it was so small that we often felt most intolerably hungry.

60|$|From {{the summit}} <b>we</b> <b>obtained</b> a very {{extensive}} and singular view.

The rocks yielded a dry poor soil, on which grew dwarf Phoenix and cycas-palm (Cycas circinalis or pectinata).|$|E
