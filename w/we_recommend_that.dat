2500|$|Additionally, in 2005, the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee {{recommended}} {{the creation of}} a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the UK and observed that: The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> <b>that</b> one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a [...] "gate-keeping" [...] test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US Daubert test.|$|E

30|$|The {{different}} {{definitions of}} control groups {{could be one}} of the possible sources of heterogeneity among those included studies. Instead of distinguishing sepsis from normal healthy controls, the methods to distinguish non-infectious SIRS from sepsis were truly necessary in the real world clinical situation. However, normal healthy controls might be included in the clinical trials for good diagnostic outcomes. From our result (see Table  5), we found lower diagnostic accuracy when leaving out the normal healthy controls from control groups (AUC value 0.84). Consequently, the reliability of the pooled result could be called into question. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> future studies avoid the case–control design as QUADAS- 2 suggested [21].|$|R

Sixteen women heads of household were recruited. Data were generated by semi structured interviews. Our findings indicated that remainder of resources (money, time and energy) alongside perceived severity of health risk were two main factors whereas women’s personal and socio-economic characteristics were two contextual factors involved in these women's health promotion activities. To help these women improve their health status, <b>we</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>that</b> the government, non-governmental organizations and health care professionals provide them with required resources and increase their knowledge by holding training sessions...|$|R
