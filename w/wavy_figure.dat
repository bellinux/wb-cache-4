For a woman of forty-two, with two {{children}} and three books of poems--and not knowing which had taken least out of her--with hazel-gray eyes, wavy eyebrows darker than they should have been, a glint of red in her hair; <b>wavy</b> <b>figure</b> and lips; quaint, half-humorous indolence, quaint, half-humorous warmth--was she not as satisfactory a woman as a man could possibly have married! ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) is a wood species {{particularly}} {{known for}} its wavy grain figure and its high-value utilization among luthiers and craftsmen for making musical instruments or furniture. In this study, the anatomical and physical-acoustical characteristics of its wood, taken from different trees with various surface figures, were characterized. Vibrational mechanical measurements were conducted taking into account radial and longitudinal directions and local variations. Waviness parameters were quantified on split blocks, and anatomical properties such as microfibril angle and ray dimensions were measured using light microscopy. Results provide a complete dataset on the properties of sycamore maple along a gradient of the <b>wavy</b> <b>figure.</b> Through statistical analysis, significant correlations {{were found between the}} measured parameters, particularly between the waviness and microfibril angle, and between the anatomical features and the specific modulus of elasticity and damping by internal friction of the wood in the longitudinal direction. Anisotropy was found to be very low but was not satisfactorily explained by the studied anatomical features. Prospects for future studies on the <b>wavy</b> <b>figure</b> are discussed...|$|E

She grew up in Vienna, Austria, {{attending}} the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule (1930) and the Academy of Fine Arts (1931 - 1932). She was one of few women to exhibit in the annuals of the Secession and the Künstlerhaus. In 1933 she moved to Paris and studied with Naoum Aronson (a stone carver for Auguste Rodin). In 1935, she became the youngest full member of the Nationale Societe des Beaux Arts. In December 1936, she immigrated to New York and participated in many one-person and group exhibitions. Her career history includes 19 one-person exhibitions and over 125 group shows. She was the recipient of a Mark Rothko Foundation grant award in 1973; the same year her monumental aluminum sculpture Drawing in the Sky # 1 was installed during a show at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York where it remains on exhibition. She died in 1981 in New York...|$|E

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] dock (Rumex crispus L.) is a perennial. It does not have creeping roots or rhizomes (Figure 1). Leaves are oblong to nearly lanceshaped, often 12 inches or more long, with <b>wavy</b> (crisped) margins (<b>Figure</b> 2). Erect, generally unbranched stems up to 5 feet tall are produced in spring and flower in summer. Broadleaf dock (Rumex obtusifolius L.) is similar to curly dock, but generally has larger, broader leaves, and one to three pointed teeth on the wing of the structure enclosing the fruit (the calyx; see Figure 3). In distribution, it’s more or less restricted to pastures and fields west of the Cascades, primarily in coastal counties...|$|R
5000|$|The {{identification}} {{of many of}} the scenes remains uncertain, with new identifications having been proposed only recently, and not all identifications agreed between, for example, Watson in 1981, Tkacz in 2001 and Bayens in 2004. [...] The primary identifications here follow Watson, sometimes mentioning alternatives. Watson's notes summarize most but not all other identifications. [...] For example, the scene on the back panel that Watson calls the Calling of Andrew and Peter by Jesus, which she admits is a rare subject not otherwise known in a similar composition, is called the Transfiguration of Christ by Tkacz, followed by Bayens and a number of reviewers. That would also be an unusual depiction, though of a far more common subject. The key difference in reading the image is whether the <b>wavy</b> lines the <b>figures</b> stand on represent cloud or water. All three authors are able to relate the subject they have chosen to their differing interpretations of the overall scheme of decoration.|$|R
