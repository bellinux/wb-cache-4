500|$|In June 2010, Tim Ferguson {{revealed}} that the break-up was {{due in large part}} to personal health issues. [...] Unknown to the public at the time, Ferguson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 after experiencing symptoms for several years including a few severe episodes while touring in 1993. [...] The symptoms affected his mobility, causing him to struggle with choreography and physical routines onstage and eventually, he says, [...] "it was clear I couldn't remain a Doug Anthony Allstar with <b>whatever</b> <b>this</b> was". Still coming to terms with his diagnosis, Ferguson chose to keep it private, telling few people outside of his close friends and family. [...] "I didn't want other people to know," [...] he says. [...] "I didn't want it to be coming up in conversation with strangers." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{words for}} gods and men, the word elf {{is used in}} {{personal}} names where words for monsters and demons are not. Just as álfar are associated with Æsir in Old Norse, the Old English Wið færstice associates elves with ēse; <b>whatever</b> <b>this</b> word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods. In Old English, the plural ylfe (attested in Beowulf) is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as a people. As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word ælf and its feminine derivative ælbinne were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs. This fits well with the word ælfscȳne, which meant [...] "elf-beautiful" [...] and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines Sarah and Judith.|$|E

500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out.

But its theoretical claims about law's autonomy are very powerful postulates, presented in advance of (and even, perhaps, in place of) the kind of detailed empirical study of social and legal change that comparatists and most legal sociologists are likely to favour. The postulates of autopoiesis theory do not so much guide empirical research as explain conclusively how to interpret <b>whatever</b> <b>this</b> research may discover." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors in some way that facilitates mind-control. [...] <b>Whatever</b> <b>this</b> drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't know exactly what the drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, Harris says {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem to be some sort of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E
