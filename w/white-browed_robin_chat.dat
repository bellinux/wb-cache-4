5000|$|Gould {{recognised}} {{the similarity}} between the buff-sided robin and the closely allied <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> (Poecilodryas superciliosa), a species discovered by John Gilbert in the Burdekin region of Queensland in 1845. Gould stated that the buff-sided and <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> were [...] "...doubtless representatives {{of each other in}} the respective countries they inhabit...". Between 1958 and 1994 a number of authors considered P. superciliosa (NE Australia) and P. cerviniventris (NW Australia) to be a single species {{as a result of these}} similarities.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> (Poecilodryas superciliosa) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Petroicidae. It is endemic to {{north-eastern}} Australia.

50|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> has, as {{its name}} suggests, a {{prominent}} white marking resembling an eyebrow above its eyes.

50|$|The red-necked crake (Rallina tricolor), {{previously}} thought to only occur {{as far south}} as Townsville, was first observed in the park in 1981. The buff-breasted paradise kingfisher (Tanysiptera sylvia) and the <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> (Poecilodryas superciliosa) are at the southern extent of their distribution at Eungella.The regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus) occurs at its northern limit in the park and surrounding area. as does the brown thornbill (Acanthisa pusilla) and the glossy black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami).Grey swiftlets (also known as Australian swiftlets) (Aerodramus terraereginea) breed in caves in the Finch Hatton Creek area, and glossy swiftlets (Collocalia esculenta) are also found in the park.|$|R

5000|$|The buff-sided robin was {{initially}} described under the binominal name Petroica cerviniventris (Family Petroicidae) by John Gould in 1857, however placement in the genus Petroica was tentative. In a discussion {{relating to the}} buff-sided robin and closely allied <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> Gould subsequently observed that [...] "...as both differ somewhat in form from the typical members of the genus, or true Petroica, it may in all probability be found necessary to institute a distinct genus for their reception". The buff-sided robin was later assigned to the genus Poecilodryas, a grouping that includes seven species from the Australian mainland, New Guinea and the eastern Indonesian Islands of Misool, Salawai and Waigeo.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> was {{described}} by the naturalist John Gould in 1847; the genus name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words poekilos [...] "little" [...] and dryas [...] "dryad". The species name is derived from the Latin word supercilium [...] "eyebrow". It {{is a member of the}} Australasian robin family Petroicidae, or Eopsaltridae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed this group in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, fairy-wrens, honeyeaters and crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida, or [...] "advanced" [...] songbirds, within the songbird lineage.|$|R

50|$|In general {{this is a}} {{large area}} of {{relatively}} unspoit grassland used for grazing cattle. Some damage results from intensive cattle ranching leading to overgrazing and disrupting the traditional Aboriginal fire regimes in which the grasslands are systematically burnt and allowed to regenerate. Woodlands next to rivers and other water sources were severely altered when ranching began, causing siltation along the Ord River and destroying important habitat of the <b>white-browed</b> <b>robin</b> (Poecilodryas superciliosa) and the purple-crowned fairywren. Habitats have also been damaged by introduced species of plants such as bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypifolia), and castor oil plant (Ricinus communis). There are some protected areas, mainly other types of habitat rather than grazing land. Areas such as the caves of Gregory National Park are still being researched by botanists and zoologists.|$|R
