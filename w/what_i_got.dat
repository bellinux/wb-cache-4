500|$|Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation {{gave the}} game the only entirely {{positive}} review in the show's history, calling it [...] "the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece". Croshaw went on to say: [...] "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>got,</b> but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending [...] "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish" [...] (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).|$|E

This is a real-world...Continue taking the fighters down to the New York City area, JFK [...] area, if you can. Make sure that the FAA clears it—your route all the way through...Let's press with this." [...] Unsure of their target, they were {{directed}} to a holding pattern in military-controlled airspace Whiskey 105 off of Long Island to avoid New York area air traffic. At 9:03am, United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower as the fighters were progressing to their holding position. The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not advised of this hijacked aircraft until 9:03.|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>got.</b> And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roach {{was part}} of the West Indies squad which toured Sri Lanka in November and December 2010. Senior bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards were absent, leaving Roach {{as the head of the}} attack. In the lead up, he {{attempted}} to develop his use of swing to cope with Sri Lankan pitches traditionally unhelpful to fast bowlers. Roach remarked [...] "I still have a little bit of work to do on my lengths, but I'm satisfied with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out of the camp". Roach's performance in the Tests, finishing as the West Indies lead wicket-taker with 10wickets at an average of 24.50 for which he was named Man of the Series, was highlighted by Sammy, the team's captain, as one of the best performances of the drawn series.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{had a more}} hard edged sound {{than the}} Impressions had before. On this new sound Mayfield claimed it was {{something}} he [...] "long wanted to do...but were out of category of what was expected of me and the Impressions. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> off in the Curtis album allowed me to be more personal for myself.". The two singles off the album [...] "(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go" [...] and [...] "Move on Up" [...] showcased Mayfield's new funk musical style, {{while the rest of the}} tracks were much softer soul based songs. Not having any traditional music lessons, Mayfield claimed his backing band would occasionly comment [...] "gosh, this is a terribly strange key to play in", but still played it accordingly as written. According to Joseph L. Tirabassi of Tiny Mix Tapes, [...] "We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue" [...] exemplified the [...] "gliding soul" [...] and [...] "hard-hitting funk" [...] the rest of the album veered between.|$|E

2500|$|Mondale {{gradually}} {{pulled away}} from Hart in the delegate count, but the race was not decided until June, on [...] "Super Tuesday III". Decided that day were delegates from five states: South Dakota, New Mexico, West Virginia, California and New Jersey. The proportional nature of delegate selection meant that Mondale was likely to obtain enough delegates on that day to secure the stated support of an overall majority of delegates, and hence the nomination, no matter who actually [...] "won" [...] the states contested. However, Hart maintained that unpledged superdelegates that had previously claimed support for Mondale would shift to his side if he swept the Super Tuesday III primary. Once again, Hart committed a faux pas, insulting New Jersey shortly before the primary day. Campaigning in California, he remarked that while the [...] "bad news" [...] was {{that he and his}} wife had to campaign separately, [...] "he good news for her is that she campaigns in California while I campaign in New Jersey." [...] Compounding the problem, when his wife interjected that she [...] "got to hold a koala bear", Hart replied that [...] "I won't tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to hold: samples from a toxic waste dump." [...] While Hart won California, he lost New Jersey after leading in polls by as much as 15 points.|$|E
