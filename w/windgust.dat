40|$|A {{comparison}} of the sensitivity and intrusion of twenty pilot workload assessment techniques was conducted using a psychomotor loading task in a three degree of freedom moving base aircraft simulator. The twenty techniques included opinion measures, spare mental capacity measures, physiological measures, eye behavior measures, and primary task performance measures. The primary task was an instrument landing system (ILS) approach and landing. All measures were recorded between the outer marker and the middle marker on the approach. Three levels (low, medium, and high) of psychomotor load were obtained by the combined manipulation of <b>windgust</b> disturbance level and simulated aircraft pitch stability. Six instrument rated pilots participated in four seasons lasting approximately three hours each...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{establishing}} a high-resolution climatology of extreme winds over Switzerland using a numerical modelling approach. The basic {{model is the}} Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM; Caya and Laprise, 1999) to which is applied a new <b>windgust</b> parameterisation (Brasseur, 2001; Goyette et al., 2003). This model has previously shown genuine skill in downscaling a number of observed windstorms over Western Europe using the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis as driving data (e. g. Goyette et al., 2001). As input data, this study uses the simulated outputs of the UK HADLEY Center’s HADCM 3 coupled ocean-atmosphere global model - available in the EU 5 th Framework Program “PRUDENCE” project (Christensen et al., 2002) - for the 1961 - 1990 period. Using the multiple self-nesting procedure of the CRCM, a number of storms are downscaled at 2 km over Switzerland. The preliminary analysis of ten windstorms is very encouraging: the potential areas which experienced severe winds agree well with observations. Most of the severe winds episodes are embedded in westerly flows; however observations show that strong winds may also be generated by southerly and northerly type of flows. These results thus prompt {{the need for further}} storm investigation to encompass the largest portion of potential extreme wind cases since the ultimate goal is to assess the change in the behaviour of extreme winds under climate changes based on the IPCC A 2 greenhouse-gas emission scenario...|$|E

40|$|An optimization-based {{methodology}} for linear control system design is outlined {{by considering the}} design of a controller for a UH- 60 rotorcraft in hover. A wide range of design specifications is taken into account: internal stability, decoupling between longitudinal and lateral motions, handling qualities, and rejection of <b>windgusts.</b> These specifications are investigated while taking into account physical limitations in the swashplate displacements and rates of displacement. The methodology crucially relies on user-machine interaction for tradeoff exploration...|$|R
50|$|The Aeryon SkyRanger {{builds on}} the {{capabilities}} of the Aeryon Scout and is a man-packable quadcopter UAV designed for aerial reconnaissance by users with minimal training. About 1 kg heavier than the Aeryon Scout at 2.5 kg, the Aeryon SkyRanger shares the map-based control interface. The SkyRanger is capable of longer duration flight, and can fly up to 50 minutes with a dual EO/IR payload. The SkyRanger has a higher bitrate, IP-based network and is capable of streaming HD video from over 5 km, with multicasting capabilities. The vehicle is all-weather capable, with an industrial temperature range and has a top speed of 65 km/h. It is able to withstand <b>windgusts</b> up to 90 km/h. The Aeryon SkyRanger has a folding design that makes it quickly deployable.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of Flagstaff Point is Belmore Basin and Brighton Beach. Belmore Basin is the man made section of Wollongong Harbour and was built using convict labour and is a {{heritage}} site with plaques along a history walk. There are two eastern breakwaters, a small stubby one of cement topped stone for the old lighthouse, and a large artificial boulder one with a {{light at the end}} for aiding ships in fog. At the portside is the fish market and a number of restaurants. Along the harbour dock are several charter vessels and private fishing boats. In the main harbour are private yachts and recreational vessels. This is to the west. Brighton Beach has recently been heavily eroded by the sea and is very thin. It stretches from the Lions Park playgrounds to the east to the western breakwater to the west. This is owned by the department of lands and used by photographers. From here the coastal cliff runs to North Beach, passing the baths and indoor seapools. Along here the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track or Heartcare Walk runs, this section is the Peace Mile section and runs to North Beach. Atop the cliffs, the edge of Smiths Hill mass, is another path and Cliff Drive. Settlement goes up to this road. The cliffs and grass/bushland about them are managed by bushcare groups and include native and inasive weed species. Lantana and Bitou Bush are prevalent, as well as Moreton Bay Figs and Acacias. North of this is North Beach {{at the end of the}} cliff. This popular surfing spot is used for competitions and private recreation, though has been damaged by erosion in the June 2007 <b>windgusts.</b>|$|R
