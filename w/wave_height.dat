5|$|Shortly after Dean formed, the {{government}} of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. When the storm weakened and ultimately dissipated, the warnings were canceled. The remnants of Dean produced unsettled conditions across Bermuda, including a wind gust of 41mph (66km/h) and light rainfall of 0.31inches (8mm). The passage of Dean resulted in the coldest day of August 2001 on the island. Dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63mph (103km/h) in Newfoundland, along with rainfall up to 4.2inches (107mm) in eastern Newfoundland.

5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> before breaking.|$|E

The joint distributions of <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> and periods and the marginal height distributions are examined. The observed significant <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> and periods of the extreme waves are also studied. Seas are classified by the shapes of their power density spectra. Spectra with a single peak are designated as unimodal and spectra with two peaks as bimodal. Seas are further classified by spectral width, {{a function of the}} thee lowest spectral moments. The joint distributions of <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> and periods from seas with narrow spectral widths take the general shape predicted by narrow-band theory and the statistics of extreme waves for these seas are well described.

5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled eye. At 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a significant <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E
5|$|When Gilda was {{forecast}} to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings {{were issued}} from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion. After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued {{at various times}} from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> of 28ft (8.5m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the time of it becoming extratropical, Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74mph (119km/h).|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of the sea keeping qualities of a ship, it is {{considered}} indispensable to measure the encountered <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> and to know the relation between the ship's motions and the ocean wave form, simultanously, during the ship's cruising course. From this point of view, the authors devised a step-type wave measuring apparatus which could be fixed on a side of the midship of a fishing boat for the measurement of the relative encountered <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> vertical to the sea surface at a given point on the ship's body. Then, there is the problem to obtain the exact measurement of the encountered <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> in the way described above, for the relative <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> include the components of the ship's motions. In this study, as the relative <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> were measured, the encountered <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> were obtained by subtracting the ship's motions from the relative <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> algebraically. On the other hand, as the pitching angles and heaving accelerations were measured during the ship's motions, it was necessary to convert accelerations into displacements by way of double integration {{on the basis of the}} recorded motions. There were some difficulties in the method of double integration of the recorded wave data, but the authors obtained a practically effective method. The following results were obtained from this study. 1) The double integration of the observed vertical accelerations which were recorded as analogous values was carried by the approximate integral method by the use of an active band pass filter with the frequency range from 0. 03 Hz to 0. 07 Hz. The amplitude gain was ± 0. 5 dB and the phase shift was less than 15 deg. 2) The error of measurement of the <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> by this method could be estimated to be within 10 % in the range of frequency for the heaving motions of the fishing boat by the experimental way. 耐航性に関する実船試験の場合,時間の関数として波高を連続測定する事が前提条件であり,出合い波高測定を必要とする。このために船体装着型のステップ式波高計を製作し,相対波高をまず測定した。得られた出合いの相対波高より,これに含まれている船体運動の影響を除き,出合波高を得る方法を試みた。船体運動の要素中でヒービングは加速度で得られているため,これを変位に変換する 2 回積分法が最も困難であるが本手法による結果は次の通りである。 1) 2 回積分法にはアナログ演算法を用いたが,積分回路の利得特性は 0. 03 Hz以上の周波数範囲で誤差は± 0. 5 dB以内であり,位相誤差は- 15 度以内であった。 2) 相対波高測定から出合い波高算出までの総合精度は,船体の上下動加速度信号の 2 回積分の精度如何である。周波数領域での検討の結果,ヒービングの主要周波数範囲内で、利得特性で最大誤差 10 %以内,位相誤差は- 10 度以内であった。 3) 実船試験のための出合い波高計測法としての本手法は,現場測定等の諸条件から考察し,実用的に有効であり十分な精度であると考えられる...|$|R

By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on {{the eastern edge of the}} circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics. At 1600 UTC on September 27, the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Islip, New York, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on western Long Island. This was only about three days after Henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|At 0930UTC on August17, {{the center}} of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The {{northern}} eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13in (33cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and {{in an environment of}} low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category3 hurricane by the evening of August17. Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category4 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on August18, Dean reached Category5 intensity {{for the first time with}} 165mph (270km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800UTC August18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33ft (10m). On August18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August19 with some trochiodal wobbles.|$|E
