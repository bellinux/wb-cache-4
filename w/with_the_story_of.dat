5|$|According to scholar Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, {{the legend}} of Banai has close {{parallels}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> King Dushyanta and Shakuntala from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The tale of another folk god Mhaskoba (Bhairava) to gain his wife Balurani or Balai despite obstacles is also similar to Khandoba's endeavour to win over Banai.|$|E

5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E

5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still awaiting trial, and an anonymous author published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold {{more than a million}} broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though {{more likely to have been}} the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ). It was one of at least five ballads about the crime that appeared directly following the execution.|$|E

5|$|The popular {{legend of}} the Taktsang monastery is further embellished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Tenzin Rabgye, who built the temple here in 1692. It has been {{mentioned}} by authors that the 8thcentury guru Padmasmabhava had reincarnated again {{in the form of}} Tenzin Rabgye. The corroborative proofs mooted are: that Tenzin Rabgye was seen (by his friends) concurrently inside and outside his cave; even a small quantity of food was adequate to feed all visitors; no one was injured during worship (in spite of the approach track to the monastery being dangerous and slippery); and the people of the Paro valley saw in the sky various animal forms and religious symbols including a shower of flowers that appeared and also vanished in the air without touching the earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song.

And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video.

5|$|In 1300 or shortly after, Villani {{began working}} on the Cronica, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally biblical times <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up}} to 1346. He outlined the events in his Cronica in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his Cronica in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of the educated elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).|$|E
5|$|Mani's next film, Kannathil Muthamittal, dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> a {{child of}} Sri Lankan Tamil {{parentage}} adopted by Indian parents, who wishes to meet her biological mother during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The film was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, winning six National Film Awards, Filmfare Award for Best Direction in Tamil, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, and an award at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles. In 2004, he made Aaytha Ezhuthu, which {{tells the story of}} how one incident sends the lives of three youths on a collision course and received positive reviews. Mani made the film simultaneously in Hindi as Yuva, his second venture into Bollywood. Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, and Vivek Oberoi replaced Surya Sivakumar, R. Madhavan, and Siddharth, respectively in the Hindi version. Unlike Yuva, Aaytha Ezhuthu was appreciated by critics. Mani suffered his first heart attack while shooting for Aaytha Ezhuthu.|$|E

Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, {{and began a}} strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked {{at home in a}} paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring {{thought it was a good}} idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E
