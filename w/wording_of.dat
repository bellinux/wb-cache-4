Whatever the case, the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E

5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("...

40|$|Word-of-mouth {{advertising}} involves {{activities to}} encourage consumers {{to talk about}} a product or company to friends and neighbours, setting in motion a chain of communication that could spread through a whole market. Each activity, itself small and relatively unimportant, could escalate through <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth to create strong, positive brand images and beliefs. A major characteristic of chaos theory, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) is at work in <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. This paper reviews <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth literature from a chaos/complexity theory perspective. Using a multiple case study approach, the significance <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth in turbulent markets is assessed. It was found that more successful companies tended to use <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth proactively, and that it is an effective marketing tool for turbulent environments. Furthermore, chaos theory is shown as a good lens through which to view <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. This paper is important because <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth has had little attention from the academic community, with the exception of electronic or Internet based <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth. Furthermore, it suggests an academic theory to underpin <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth that has not been considered before. In addition, it is important because, in South Africa and possibly in other under-developed and developing countries, <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth is critical to marketing to less sophisticated or literate markets...|$|R
