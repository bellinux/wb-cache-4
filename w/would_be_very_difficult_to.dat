25|$|New to the Hercules {{system was}} the Target Ranging Radar, or TRR. It is {{relatively}} easy to jam range information on monopulse radars like the TTR by sending out false return signals. The radar can continue to locate the target in elevation or azimuth because all of the signals come from the same location, but the receiver cannot easily determine which pulse was sent by the radar and which was sent by the electronic countermeasures (ECM) on the target aircraft. The TRR system combatted this by operating on two selectable very different set of frequencies. The result was fine for ranging but useless for position determination. This signal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> jam because the jammer would have to broadcast across a wide set of frequencies in order to ensure they were returning on the frequency the receiver had actually selected. Meanwhile, the TTR can continue offering location information, and in the case that is also jammed (difficult but possible), was upgraded to offer a home-on-jam mode that used the ECM system's own broadcasts as a location source. Skilled operators could also try to track the target in a manual tracking mode.|$|E

When the pitch was rejected, he decided to work with an artist to finish a new pitch in a shorter time. He contacted artist Joysuke Wong, who agreed to collaborate; Druckmann called the collaboration the [...] "easiest decision" [...] he made while working on the comic, as he was very impressed by her artwork. In collaboration with each other, Druckmann and Wong developed the pitch—the first six pages of the story—in about two months. They worked on the comic {{for over a year}} prior to completion. Druckmann created a schedule for his work on the comic, primarily working at night due to his job at video game company Naughty Dog, where he was working on [...] (2009).

500|$|By February 2005, Paul Lovett and David Elliot, {{who wrote}} di Bonaventura's Four Brothers, were {{rewriting}} Gordon's draft. In their script, the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander, whom Destro needs to lead {{an army of}} supersoldiers. Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007, and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line. Di Bonaventura explained, [...] "Unfortunately, our president [...] has {{put us in a}} position internationally where it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> release a movie called G.I. Joe. To add one character to the mix is sort of a fun thing to do." [...] The script was leaked online by El Mayimbe of Latino Review, who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan, a crooked CIA agent. In this draft, Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke, and is killed by the Baroness. Snake Eyes speaks, but his vocal cords are slashed during the story, rendering him mute. Mayimbe suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script. Fan response to the film following the script review was negative. Di Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites, [...] "I'm hoping we're going to get it right this time." [...] He admitted he had problems with Cobra, concurring with an interviewer [...] "they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [...] ". Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script.|$|E

500|$|Many {{other changes}} were made to Dunderberg while she was under {{construction}} and significantly contributed to her delays in completion. The {{most important of these}} was the eventual elimination of her turrets which began in October 1863 when Webb wrote to Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, saying that he concurred with the General Superintendent of Ironclads, Rear Admiral Francis Gregory's suggestion that the [...] "turrets be dispensed with and the casemate lengthened to accommodate an additional number of guns" [...] Welles did not approve the change until September 1864 when he authorized an armament of four 15-inch and twelve 11-inch guns in the casemate. This was extended by [...] to an approximate overall length of [...] so that it now covered the aft magazine and shell room. It was provided with a total of 22 gun ports, six on each broadside, two on each corner and one each facing the bow and stern. The design of the gun ports was another issue that took years to resolve. They were originally sized for the 11-inch Dahlgren gun with a height of , but this was inadequate to allow the guns to fully elevate as experience with [...] proved. The mounting of the much larger 15-inch Dahlgren gun in the casemate further complicated the design of the gun ports, especially since the design for their carriages was not even finished until May 1866. The design of the gunport itself was revised {{in the second half of}} 1865 to reduce the chance of projectiles entering them; the new design was roughly hourglass shaped and narrower in the middle of the casemate than on either the inside or the outside of the gun port. All of these changes to the gun ports delayed the completion of the casemate's woodwork as well as the cutting and installation of the casemate armor. The angle of the casemate was also changed from the original very shallow 35° from the horizontal to an angle of 60° after Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, noted that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work the guns at such an angle. The deletion of the turrets also required a redesign of the conning tower as Webb had intended to mount it on top of the fore turret. A copy of that used by the [...] monitors was installed between the funnel and the foremast during August 1866.|$|E
2500|$|A general {{instrumentation}} setup used originally for American marches <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> explain, as [...] most bands {{were extremely}} varied {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. As stated before, most of the standard march music was written for the composer's band. Whether that be the Sousa, Ringling Bros., [...] or Gilmore, every band typically had marches written by their conductor in repertoire. With that said, [...] most marches were also written in a very specific instrumentation.

Peltz then went on and argued that the Me 262 would be better utilized as an interceptor aircraft.|$|E
