25|$|Akilattirattu {{speaks of}} his {{incineration}} of evil spirits {{as an important}} event in Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the kalimayai - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam). The possessed ones danced {{in front of the}} crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.|$|E

25|$|Soon his {{business}} was growing {{so fast that}} Samuel House became his sole agent in New York. In 1867 he had taken two of his employees into partnership. Edward Failing, who in 1857 when he was sixteen had first started to work at H.W. Corbett and Co <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> school, and M.B. Millard. Each became a sixth interest partner in H.W. Corbett and Co. Edward had been only ten {{when he first came}} out to Portland with his father Josiah Failing and older brother Henry Failing, who was then seventeen and later became Corbett’s brother-in-law. By September 1867 H.W. Corbett & Co. had its own office in New York City and was no longer employing an agent.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{had planned}} {{to walk through the}} ballroom <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> speaking, on his way to another {{gathering}} of supporters elsewhere in the hotel. However, with deadlines fast approaching, reporters wanted a press conference. Campaign aide Fred Dutton decided that Kennedy would forgo the second gathering and instead go through the hotel's kitchen and pantry area behind the ballroom to the press area. Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said, [...] "No, it's been changed. We're going this way." [...] Barry and Dutton began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor, but Kennedy, hemmed in by the crowd, followed maître d'hôtel Karl Uecker through a back exit.|$|E
500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> Richardson said, [...] "Ah, I think I know what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E

500|$|At {{his meeting}} with Mulgrave, Cochrane was asked to explain a plan of attack on Basque Roads which he had drawn up some years previously. Cochrane enthusiastically {{described}} his intention to use fireships and massive floating bombs to destroy a fleet anchored in the roads. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> Mulgrave announced that the plan was going ahead and that Cochrane was to command it. Cochrane was in poor health, and under no illusions about Mulgrave's intentions: should the attack fail Cochrane would be blamed and his political career damaged. In addition, Cochrane was also {{well aware of the}} fury this decision would provoke in the naval hierarchy; the appointment of a relatively junior officer in command of such an important operation was calculated to cause offense. Cochrane refused, even though Mulgrave pleaded that he had been the only officer to present a practical plan for attacking Allemand's fleet. Again Cochrane refused the command, but the following day Mulgrave issued a direct order: [...] "My Lord you must go. The board cannot listen to further refusal or delay. Rejoin your frigate at once." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> his {{education}} at the grammar school, his father thought of apprenticing him to his own business, to which an elder brother Henry had already devoted himself; {{and it was only}} through the influence of his elder brother William (afterwards Lord Stowell), who had already obtained a fellowship at University College, Oxford, that it was ultimately resolved that he should continue with his studies. Accordingly, in 1766, John Scott entered University College with the view of taking holy orders and obtaining a college living.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>finished,</b> Taurello {{shrugs and}} admits {{that his own}} life's work, {{seemingly}} more substantial, has been demolished by Ecelin's abdication, and impulsively throws the Imperial baldric on Sordello's neck, declaring him head {{of the house of}} Romano. A strange intuition arises in both. It is then that Palma confesses what she has known for more than a year: Sordello is Taurello's son, the child <b>he</b> thought <b>had</b> perished at Vicenza.|$|R

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that it is settled; we have had one day at each of the sports. Rabah said that to-morrow we could either go out and see new modes of fishing, or {{accompany}} the fowlers and watch them catching birds in the clap nets, or go out into the desert and hunt ibex. Chebron did not decide, but I suppose <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>finished</b> his letter we shall hear what he intends to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Now it {{came about}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> {{speaking}} to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him {{and gave it to}} David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt. So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. (NASB) ...|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} October 1883, {{with enough}} money to last about four months Caine, {{accompanied}} by Mary, went to the Isle of Wight where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near Sandown. [...] There he set to work writing his first novel The Shadow of a Crime. Inspired by his Cumbrian heritage the plot was based {{on one of the}} oldest legends of the Lake District, told to him by his grandfather, Ralph Hall. In it he uses the Cumbrian dialect that he had listened to and spoke during his childhood. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> he moved back to London. Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in Lincoln’s Inn, he re-wrote it. After running as a serial in the Liverpool Mercury, Caine’s novel was published in February 1885, by Chatto & Windus, and serialised in several newspapers. [...] He was later invited to write the story of writing The Shadow of a Crime, which after its appearance in the Idler was published in 1894 in My First Book. [...] After the publication of Caine's first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.|$|E

60|$|While {{things were}} thus the Earl married again,--the penniless {{daughter}} of a noble house,--a woman not young, for she was forty <b>when</b> <b>he</b> married her, but {{more than twenty years}} his junior. It sufficed for him that she was noble, and as he believed good. Good to him she was,--with a duty that was almost excessive. Religious she was, and self-denying; giving much and demanding little; keeping herself in the background, but possessing wonderful energy in the service of others.
