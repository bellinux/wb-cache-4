5000|$|Kanban: Kanban is the {{foundational}} practice of lean thinking (the Toyota Production System {{used to be}} first known as the Kanban system). Any process will have different output. For instance, nowadays, a writer will produce books, keynote speeches, blog posts, tweets and answer e-mails. The question is, {{at the present time}} right now, how can the person using the process know whether they are doing what is needed for customers right now or whether they are <b>working</b> ahead <b>on</b> <b>something</b> not that important and lagging behind <b>on</b> <b>something</b> critical. In project management this creates segments ahead and segments late, and end of project panic. In production this creates entire warehouses of inventories to compensate for the inability to produce right now what is needed. Kanban is a simple technique using cards or post-it notes to visualize “leveled” (i.e. averaged to avoid peaks and troughs) activity at the process. The writer will start a new book when she’s delivered one. She will worry about the new conference when it’s time to. She will write a new blog post at a steady rhythm rather than publish five in a rush and then one and so on. In production, Kanban cards make sure employees are <b>working</b> <b>on</b> what is needed right now and not overproducing parts which will then linger in inventory whilst others will be unavailable. Kanban is the main practice to reveal all misfits between today’s activities and how the market behaves. Kanban teaches one lean thinking by constantly challenging assumptions about market behavior and our own flexibility.|$|R
2500|$|During their {{extended}} periods {{in the hotel}} suite, the Beatles collaborated on a psychedelic-themed painting, using brushes and paints supplied {{by one of the}} visiting tradesmen, and listened to a tape of their new album. Whitaker photographed them at work and later commented: [...] "I never saw them calmer, more contented than at this time. They were <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>something</b> that let their personalities come out … They'd stop, go and do a concert and then it was, 'Let's go back to the picture!'" [...] Having struggled to find a title for the new album since their arrival in Munich, the Beatles finally settled on Revolver and informed EMI of their decision by telegram on 2 July. Whitaker recalled that, despite the hours of confinement in the Hilton, the atmosphere within the band while in Tokyo was [...] "a crescendo of happiness".|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum made {{a similar}} argument. In an article listing over twenty {{examples}} of bad quartos, Kirschbaum did not include A Shrew, which he felt was too different from The Shrew to come under the bad quarto banner; [...] "despite protestations to the contrary, The Taming of a Shrew does not stand in relation to The Shrew as The True Tragedie, for example, stands in relation to 3 Henry VI." [...] Writing in 1998, Stephen Roy Miller offers much the same opinion; [...] "the relation of the early quarto to the Folio text is unlike other early quartos because the texts vary much more in plotting and dialogue [...] {{the differences between the}} texts are substantial and coherent enough to establish that there was deliberate revision in producing one text out of the other; hence A Shrew is not merely a poor report (or 'bad quarto') of The Shrew." [...] Character names are changed, basic plot points are altered (Kate has two sisters for example, not one), the play is set in Athens instead of Padua, the Sly framework forms a complete narrative, and entire speeches are completely different, all of which suggests to Miller that the author of A Shrew thought they were <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>something</b> different from Shakespeare's play, not attempting to transcribe it for resale; [...] "underpinning the notion of a 'Shakespearean bad quarto' is the assumption that the motive of whoever compiled that text was to produce, differentially, a verbal replica of what appeared on stage." [...] Miller believes that Chambers and Kirschbaum successfully illustrate A Shrew does not fulfil this rubric.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>something,</b> the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E

The album {{was meant to}} be released in December 1997, but was delayed by four months, with Del Naja spending most of the time in the studio [...] "making tracks, tearing them apart, [...] them up, panicking, then starting again." [...] Mezzanine was a pretty sketchy album in terms of the way we worked, because the band, as reported a lot at that time, were not getting on. So I'd be in the studio working with one of the members and someone else would come in, then the person I had been working with would leave and I'd have to change the track I was <b>working</b> <b>on</b> because they didn't want to work on that track, they wanted to work <b>on</b> <b>something</b> different.
