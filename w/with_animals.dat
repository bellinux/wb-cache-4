40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} {{of water and}} methanol (W/M) fractions {{on the performance of}} a compression ignition engine fuelled <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> fat (obtained from duck) emulsions is studied. A single cylinder air-cooled, direct injection diesel engine developing a rated brake power output of 2. 8 kW at 1500 r/min is tested using diesel neat animal fat, and <b>animal</b> fat emulsions <b>with</b> different fractions of W/M. Results show reduced peak pressure <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat when compared <b>with</b> diesel. <b>Animal</b> fat emulsions result in increased peak pressure with increased W/M fractions. Ignition delay is quite high <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat. Increase in W/M amounts in the emulsions further increase the ignition delay. Heat release pattern shows improved combustion rates <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> fat emulsions at all W/M fractions when compared <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat. Drastic reduction in smoke emission from 3. 6 m(- 1) <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat to a minimum of 0. 5 m(- 1) is achieved <b>with</b> the <b>animal</b> fat emulsion at the maximum W/M fraction. NO emission is found to be lower <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat than <b>with</b> neat diesel. <b>Animal</b> fat emulsions further reduce NO emission at all W/M fractions. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are also reduced significantly <b>with</b> <b>animal</b> fat emulsions at all W/M ratios when compared <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat. In general, <b>animal</b> fat emulsions <b>with</b> different W/M fractions show considerable reduction in all emissions and improvement in engine performance when compared <b>with</b> neat <b>animal</b> fat. Emulsion of 10 W 10 M 2 S 83 (i. e. 10 per cent of water, 10 per cent of methanol, and 2 per cent of span 83 by volume) is found to be the best among the three tested emulsions for optimum performance and emissions...|$|R

5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|Each holiday season, from Light Up Night in November through Epiphany in January, the Pittsburgh Crèche delights {{visitors}} to downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Creche, a larger-than-life nativity scene, is the world’s only authorized {{replica of the}} Vatican’s Christmas crèche, on display in St. Peter’s Square in Rome. Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art also displays a Neapolitan presepio. Handcrafted between 1700 and 1830, the presepio has lifelike figures and colorful details that re-create the Nativity within a vibrant and detailed panorama of 18th-century Italian village life. More than 100 superbly modeled human and angelic figures, along <b>with</b> <b>animals,</b> accessories, and architectural elements, cover 250 square feet and create a memorable depiction of the Nativity as seen {{through the eyes of}} Neapolitan artisans and collectors.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated <b>with</b> <b>animals,</b> {{in much the same}} way as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E

5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, <b>with</b> <b>animals</b> spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E

5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical roots are unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party <b>with</b> <b>animals,</b> and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E
