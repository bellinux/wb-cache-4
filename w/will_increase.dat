5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the number of {{electrons}} in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; {{this means that the}} density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} {{burning in the}} shell around the solar core <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> {{the mass of the}} core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E
5|$|However some {{research}} shows that black carbon <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> global warming, being second only to CO2. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other {{areas such as the}} Himalayas where glacial melting occurs.

5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E

5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as solubility and lipophilicity, logp).

Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
