5|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>panelling</b> from {{a room in}} the Crown & Treaty {{public house}} was sold in 1924 to an American businessman, who {{installed}} it in his office in the Empire State Building in New York. It was returned in 1953 as a gift to the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and returned to the house, although the monarch retained ownership.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many castles in England {{which were}} {{deliberately}} seriously damaged, or slighted, {{to put them}} beyond military use, Stokesay escaped substantial harm after the war. Parliament sequestrated the property from William and ordered the slighting of the castle in 1647, but only pulled down the castle's curtain wall, leaving {{the rest of the}} complex intact. Samuel returned in 1649 to continue to rent the castle during the years of the Commonwealth, and put in <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and new windows into parts of the property. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, William's lands were returned to him, and the Baldwyns continued to lease Stokesay Castle from him.|$|E
5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape stairwell at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs. The glass exterior of the building has T-shaped white sunbreakers superimposed in an alternating pattern across the building, coated with fine mosaic tiles. With the newly enclosed top floor, the building now has 13 levels above ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
25|$|Every wall, {{window and}} ceiling was {{decorated}} in ornate style, with soaring pillars, <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and elaborate stucco featuring gambolling cherubs. Its grand saloon used 50 types of marble {{to create a}} magnificent bar-top, archways, an enormous fireplace and soaring pillars, which in turn supported the opulent part-gilded beamed ceiling. Even the chimney and walls were faced with marble.|$|E
25|$|Among the First Class cabins {{there were}} only four luxury suites, this being {{considered}} enough for even a premiere liner on the South American route. But First Class facilities did include a Grand Hall with a stage and a dance floor, an Observation Lounge, writing rooms, a library that could double as a chapel, and the smokeroom complete with stone fireplace, timber beams, stone corbels supporting some of the beams, <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> and even some Gothic Revival stone tracery. Concealed lighting was a feature {{of many of the}} rooms.|$|E
25|$|The {{pavilion}} can {{be divided}} into the clubhouse in the centre with the Governor's Pavilion and the Maharaja of Patiala Pavilion on either side and is a three-story art deco nautical structure with rounded pediments, flagpoles and port-hole windows. The pavilion boasts of dark <b>wood</b> wall <b>panelling</b> and decorative marble floors. The walls of the pavilion are adorned with portraits of past and present cricketers and photographs of famous cricket matches.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of this church {{was started in}} 1601 and was completed by 1610. The Church is dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception in 1691. Illuminated by flood lights (by night time), the main façade {{of the church is}} perhaps the most elaborate of all Portuguese churches in India. In architectural style it resembles Bom Jesus Church at Old Goa. The dominant features are, no doubt, Gothic. The <b>wood</b> - <b>panelling</b> of the church is rated {{one of the best in}} church craftsmanship.The church adorned with curiously treated volutes and shell - like motifs and the magnificent wood carving.|$|R
25|$|The design {{consisted}} of two identical wings, joined by a semicircular colonnade forming {{the backdrop of the}} amphitheatre. The colonnade was terminated on either side by a tower. Each wing had a basement and three floors above ground. The interiors were created in the Cape Dutch style with carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture. Baker used indigenous materials as far as possible. The granite was quarried on site while Buiskop sandstone was used for the courtyards. Stinkwood and Rhodesian teak were used for timber and <b>wood</b> <b>panelling.</b> The roof tiles and quarry tiles for the floors were made in Vereeniging.|$|E
25|$|During its redevelopment, the {{historical}} building had {{most of its}} special architectural features retained and restored. The conservation work was coordinated by the URA, which had certain stipulations that the new owners had to comply with. Several features of the original building had to be restored faithfully. These included the General Post Office gallery area on the ground floor, with bays that corresponded with the building's towering Doric columns on the façade, and the Straits Club Billiard Room. The post office gallery no longer exists, but has been subdivided to provide a bar, a restaurant and the hotel foyer. The Straits Club Billiard Room was kept, but without its <b>wood</b> <b>panelling.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Chapel located {{immediately}} {{behind the}} Eastern Pavilion, created in 1742-48 and originally rising through two floors. The room {{was divided into}} two floors in 1929 when the new school chapel was built, all the timber panelling being reused in the new chapel. Only the plaster ceiling decoration survives, this consists of octagons, crosses and hexagons. The elaborate carved <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> of cedarwood came from a house in Cornwall also called Stowe. It had been carved by Michael Chuke a pupil of Grinling Gibbons. The most elaborate pieces of carving were the gallery on the south side, the octagonal pulpit dated 1707 and the elaborate reredos the reached nearly the full height of the room, the lower half having two Corinthian columns flanking the altar above which used to hang a copy of Rubens's painting of 'Holy Lamb'. This in turn was flanked by rich carving of fruit and plants. Above was a very rich carving of the Royal Arms.|$|E
5000|$|The entablature and dais at {{the eastern}} end were also {{designed}} by D. M. Hahn. The columns and entablature are made of purple heart <b>wood,</b> while the <b>panelling</b> is fustic (yellow tinted wood commonly found in South America). The passageway between the two buildings which replaced the double archway, is no longer open to vehicular traffic. The fountain in {{the centre of the}} rotunda was designed by D. M. Hahn as a means of cooling and ventilation for the offices, in the days before air-conditioning.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{traditional}} pub with a Victorian atmosphere, featuring dark <b>wood</b> ceilings and <b>panelling,</b> snug booths with buttoned leather benches, tiled floors, old brass oil lamps and a real coal fire in each room. The traditional top floor room features a quirky display of barometers and beautiful Venetian mirrors. In 2006 the bar was sold for £1.7 million to Bangor entrepreneur Bill Wolsley’s Beannchor leisure group. It was then closed for six weeks for refurbishment, taking out all the gambling machines, all the TVs and jukeboxes to create a classic pub, with music rooms.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s and 70s {{plans for}} {{demolishing}} the barely century-old nave were being discussed. The church had been neglected for {{long and the}} value of the building was questioned, because of the disproportionately long nave and the short tower. Instead of tearing it down, a comprehensive renovation was made in 1977, under the supervision of architects Uno Asplund and Janne Feldt from Karlstad. The proportions of the nave were altered by making a hipped roof in the east section. The disposition of the building was also altered. The nave was shortened by building a new wall behind the altar. The room behind the altar became the new sacristy, while the old one in the extension was converted into facilities for the church staff. The area under the organ loft was sealed off with folding screens made of <b>wood.</b> The <b>panelling</b> on the west wall was removed to uncover the older timber walls with paintings.|$|R
25|$|On {{the topmost}} {{accessible}} {{floor of the}} Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower was a large indoor observation platform. As the tower was, when completed, the tallest in the city, this promontory once allowed uninterrupted views of the then quickly developing downtown core and of Lake Ontario to the south. This floor has since been converted to leased office space. On the level below is a restaurant {{on the south side}} and the Toronto-Dominion Bank corporate offices and boardroom are on the north. The interiors of the latter spaces were also designed by Mies and included his signature broad planes of rich, unadorned <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> freestanding cabinets as partitions, wood slab desks, and some of his furniture pieces, such as the Barcelona chair, Barcelona ottoman, and Brno chair. Adjacent to the main boardroom at the northeast corner of the floor plate and the Thompson Room at the northwest corner, service areas are concealed within the wood panelled walls behind secret panels.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{was used}} to frame the new areas of the {{building}} as the additions had to be sympathetic to but not similar to the original building exterior. To maintain {{the integrity of the}} original building, the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Some leniencies were allowed in order for current building codes to be met; however, strict requirements, as set out by Alberta Historical Resources, were followed when it came to restoring and renovating the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> covering {{the lower half of the}} walls needed to remain intact, as did the original cast iron radiators (which now tie in to the geothermal heating and cooling system). The only changes made to the courtroom were the restoration of the wall paint to its original 1920 splendour and the installation of a new carpet. The result of this renovation was a fabulous new City Hall that provides both employees and citizens the opportunity to showcase this beautiful community structure.|$|E
25|$|Mauretania was {{designed}} to suit Edwardian tastes. The ship's interior {{was designed}} by Harold Peto, architect, and her public rooms were fitted out by two notable London design houses – Ch. Mellier & Sons and Turner and Lord, with twenty-eight different types of wood, along with marble, tapestries, and other furnishings such as the stunning octagon table in the smoking room. <b>Wood</b> <b>panelling</b> for her first class public rooms was supposedly carved by three hundred craftsmen from Palestine but this seems unlikely, unnecessary and was probably executed by the yard or subcontracted, as were {{the majority of the}} second and third class areas. The multi-level first-class dining saloon of straw oak was decorated in Francis I style and topped by a large dome skylight. A series of elevators, then a rare new feature for liners, with grilles composed of the relatively new lightweight aluminum, were installed next to Mauretanias walnut grand staircase. A new feature was the Verandah Café on the boat deck, where passengers were served beverages in a weather-protected environment, although this was enclosed within a year as it proved unrealistic.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{cars were}} built at Shrubhill in 1932 and 1933 {{as a prelude}} to the {{development}} of a new generation of trams. Car 180 featured composite construction (steel frames but <b>wood</b> and aluminium <b>panelling,</b> unlike the predominantly timber Standard cars) and had a 5-bay body with flat sides and curved corner glazing which gave it a much more modern appearance than the Standard cars. It was delivered in a special red and grey livery which earned it the nickname [...] "Red Biddy". Car 261 was a less radical development, being essentially a Standard car with flat lower deck sides. It was withdrawn in 1955, but car 180 survived until the final closure of the Edinburgh tram system on 16 November 1956.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{architecture of}} the Thomas T. Gaff House {{is an example of}} a 17th-century Châteauesque manor, but only two rooms in the house follow French style. Gaff instructed the designers to include novel conveniences such as a hot-air system to dry clothes, a trapdoor to his icehouse so that deliveries could be made directly from the street, and cork insulation for his wine cellar. The interior features a mixture of 17th- and 18th-century designs. The main hall and dining room are lined with wooden paneling, Elizabethan wainscoting, and a sideboard that was originally used in an Italian monastery. The reception hall, which at one time doubled as a living room, contains a wooden stair rail with baroque scrollwork and walls that are covered with Louis XIII-style oak panelling. The drawing room resembles 18th-century interior design with lighter <b>wood</b> used for <b>panelling</b> and basic geometric lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this bachelor's thesis is a design of a new {{building}} for a family house in Oslavice and a processing of a project documentation for {{the realization of the}} building. The building is designed for purposes of family living and it is situated on the periphery in the east part of the village Oslavice. This part of the village is sparsely developed with family houses. The architectonical solution is designed with consideration of the building location and character of the surrounding housing development. The family house is designed as a one-family detached house intended for four- or five-member family. It is situated in a sloping terrain and it is designed as a partially basement. The designed building has two storeys above ground and a basement. On the first storey above ground there is a daily social zone, on the second storey above ground there is a quiet zone and in the basement there is a technical facility of the building. A part of the family house is a garage for deposition of one personal car. A part of the basement is placed ahead of the front entrance into the building and it is visually separated by using of <b>wood</b> exterior <b>panelling.</b> Roofing of the family house is solved by hipped truss roof and above the garage there is designed flat roof by which it is created a terrace accessible from the second storey above ground...|$|R
25|$|On 4 October 1939 in Berlin, Adolf Hitler {{issued the}} order {{to blow up the}} Royal Castle. On 10 October 1939, special German units, under the {{supervision}} of history and art experts (Dr. Dagobert Frey, an art historian at the University of Wrocław; Gustaw Barth, the director of museums in Wrocław, and Dr. Joseph Mühlmann, an art historian from Vienna) started to demount floor, marbles, sculptures and stone elements such as fireplaces or moulds. The artefacts were taken to Germany or stored in Kraków's warehouses. Many of them were also seized by various Nazi dignitaries who resided in Warsaw. The Castle was totally emptied. Disobeying German orders, despite the danger of being shot, Polish museum staff and experts in art restoration managed to save many of the works of art from the castle, as well as fragments of the stucco-work, the parquet floors, the <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> and more which were later used in the reconstruction. The great service done to Poland by Professor Stanisław Lorentz, in leading this campaign to save the castle's treasures, is well known. Wehrmacht sappers then bored tens of thousands of holes for dynamite charges in the stripped walls.|$|E
25|$|Paycocke's is a {{house built}} in or around 1500 by John Paycocke (d. 1505); it is thought it was built as a wedding present for his son Thomas and daughter-in-law Margaret as the {{initials}} T.P. and M.P. appear in the wood carvings that decorate the house. The house features elaborate <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and carvings, {{a testament to the}} wealth generated by the wool trade in East Anglia. It also features gates which some think were taken from the Abbey {{at the time of its}} dissolution. The Paycocke family moved into Coggeshall in the 15th century and exemplified a trend for successful butchers to acquire large flocks of their own sheep which would produce wool as well as meat. The wool could be used to make cloth and often the 'grazing butchers' would eventually evolve into clothiers. These merchants frequently became very wealthy during this process. Thomas was the last Paycocke to live in Coggeshall, dying in 1580. It was the sold to the Buxton family who were clothiers and from 1746 changed hands several times eventually being bought by Lord Noel-Buxton, a descendant of the original Buxtons, and given to The National Trust in 1924. Restoration work was carried out in the 1960s and the house is now open to the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the three}} refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room (1866–68) {{was the work of}} Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on {{the main part of the}} wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room (1865–77) was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble. The walls and even the Ionic columns in this room are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, and the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room (1876–81) was designed by Sir Edward Poynter; the lower part of its walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> while above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months, painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum. The windows are also stained glass; there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.|$|E
500|$|The tower {{measures}} [...] by , {{with red}} sandstone walls around [...] thick and [...] high. The ground floor was originally the parlour, with a carved wooden ceiling and a fireplace, with doors leading externally {{and into the}} hall. Originally, the stairs did not reach {{down to the ground}} floor. The first floor formed the principal chamber in the tower, accessed from stairs in the hall; it had a fireplace, a garderobe and its walls would have been plastered and painted, with <b>wood</b> <b>panelling.</b> Stairs led up to the second floor, again equipped with a fireplace and <b>wood</b> <b>panelling,</b> and up onto the roof.|$|E
500|$|The National Trust took on {{ownership}} of the castle and island in 1962 but considered the castle to be of [...] "little antiquity or architectural interest". The John Lewis Partnership leased the castle from the Trust {{for use as a}} corporate hotel by their employees, gradually restoring the buildings in stages and they remain the current tenants. Some of the 19th century interior features still survive, including <b>wood</b> <b>panelling</b> and ornamental ceilings, with some carved stone fireplaces from Venice; the castle also has four cannons, probably dating from the 17th or early 18th century. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II listed building.|$|E
500|$|The Long Gallery {{has almost}} {{continuous}} bands of windows along its longer {{sides to the}} north and south, and a window to the west; a corresponding window at the east end of the gallery is now blocked. The end tympana have plaster depictions of Destiny and Fortune, copied from Robert Recorde's [...] Castle of Knowledge of 1556. The inscriptions read [...] "The wheel of fortune, whose rule is ignorance" [...] and [...] "The speare of destiny, whose rule is knowledge". The Long Gallery was always sparsely furnished, and would have been used for exercising when the weather was inclement and as a games room– four early 17th-century tennis balls have been discovered behind the <b>wood</b> <b>panelling.</b>|$|E
