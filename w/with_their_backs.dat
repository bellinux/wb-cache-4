5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the two waterways. If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E

5|$|While Wellesley was {{preoccupied with}} re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his {{infantry}} and redeployed {{them into a}} semicircle <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley's infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry lingered in {{the distance to the}} west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> exposed.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} G4's Reunion Tour in September 2015 {{the group}} {{announced}} that they would tour the UK in April and September 2016 <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>Back</b> for Good Tour.|$|R

25|$|Centre: {{commanded}} by Afonso V, it {{was formed by}} the knights of several noblemen from his House and the Castilian knights loyal to D. Juana led by Rui Pereira. It also had 4 bodies of footmen <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> turned to the Duero River.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to shield the {{participants}} from prosecution, procedures were implemented to give all witnesses plausible deniability. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath {{that they had not}} seen any pistols. They also stood <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the duelists.|$|E
25|$|In the south, the 38th Army {{attacked}} German {{troops of}} the LIX Corps defending <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the highlands of Moravia. By means of a limited tactical withdrawal on 10 March, Heinrici was able to minimise the damage inflicted by the preparatory bombardment, and the front in this sector remained firm.|$|E

25|$|An attack {{beginning}} {{on the night}} of 26 January initially resulted in lead elements of the 28th Jäger Division breaking through to Elbing, where they linked up with the 7th Panzer Division; however German forces were driven back during the next four days after the 48th Army had regrouped. Hossbach's units now found themselves pushed into a Kessel (pocket) <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the Frisches Haff.|$|E
25|$|The French, all but {{masters of}} Spain in June, stood <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the Pyrenees, {{clutching}} at Navarre and Catalonia. It {{was not known}} if even these two footholds could be maintained {{in the face of}} a Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops with Spain's 35,000 British allies en route.|$|E
25|$|The same year, Birr became {{seriously ill}} after {{contracting}} Lyme disease from a tick bite; after he recovered, the Puhdys resumed their heavy touring schedule. He composed {{all of the}} tracks for the band's 2005 CD, Alles hat seine Zeit (Everything Has Its Time); it was claimed that the cover picture, which depicted Birr at the center with the other bandmembers <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the camera, had caused friction within the band.|$|E
50|$|In doubles, the server's {{teammate}} has {{to stand}} in the service area <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to a side wall in a service box, marked by a parallel line 18 in from the side wall, until the ball passes the short line.|$|R
25|$|Other {{forwards}} may rely {{on their}} pace to run onto long balls passed over or through the opposition defence, rather than collecting the ball <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to goal like a target man. Some forwards can play both of these roles equally well.|$|R
30|$|This {{test was}} {{conducted}} {{using the method}} described by Shumway-Cook et al. (2000) and Podsiadlo and Richardson (1991). Subjects were instructed to sit deeply in a chair with a height allowing the hip and knees to flex at 90 °, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> against the back rest.|$|R
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Syriam, Alaungpaya waited out the monsoon season. In September, one Konbaung army marched from Syriam in the south, while another army marched from Toungoo (Taungoo) in the north. The advance was slow with great losses as the Hanthawaddy {{defenses}} still had cannon and they were literally fighting <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the wall. By mid-October, the combined armies converged on Pegu. Konbaung war boats too flung off Hanthawaddy fire-rafts and completed the Konbaung line around the city.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing {{were killed}} when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead. The couple walked along the railway on a dark rainy night. When the train got to Horsted Keynes, the guard found a {{raincoat}} covered with blood on the engine. Another coat was found near two bodies {{in the middle of}} the tracks. The ganger who found them told the inquest the couple must have been walking <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the train.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Confederate Army, however, {{once they}} reached the Potomac they would find it {{difficult}} to cross. Torrential rains that started on July 4 flooded the river at Williamsport, making fording impossible. Four miles downstream at Falling Waters, Union cavalry dispatched from Harpers Ferry by Maj. Gen. William H. French destroyed Lee's lightly guarded pontoon bridge on July 4. The only way to cross the river was a small ferry at Williamsport. The Confederates could potentially be trapped, forced to defend themselves against Meade <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the river.|$|E
50|$|Act 2 {{opened with}} the {{audience}} facing a false theater set filled with actors and wax dummies, before which the cast would give little performances <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to the real audience. The set audience included likenesses of famous New Yorkers including theatre critics. Arthur Voegtlin was the set designer.|$|R
50|$|The {{opponent}} begins supine, lying <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> on {{the bottom}} or second rope and facing into the ring. The wrestler runs towards the opponent and jumps through the second and top rope while {{holding on to the}} ropes, then swings around and grapevines the opponent's arms, applying a crucifix armbar.|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} {{the fear of}} not making the full rotation, a spotter or two spotters may be used. They should stand {{to the side of}} the user, and when the user is horizontal <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> facing the floor, the spotters may give them extra rotation and height by pushing <b>their</b> <b>back</b> upwards (this is similar to the way in which spotters can be used when learning a backtuck).|$|R
25|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to extract them by landing craft, although these failed due to heavy Japanese artillery fire. <b>With</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the sea and ammunition running low amongst the troops on the beach, an LCI gunboat and the destroyers , , and , which had been ordered back from convoy escort duties, closed in to the beach at 18:00 hours, andin concert with shore based artillery and air supportprovided a barrage that allowed rescue craft to remove the raiding group from the beach; the last boat left the area at 20:40 hours under the cover of darkness.|$|E
25|$|As Chief of Staff BEF Robertson had had Maurice, then Director of Military Operations at GHQ, {{prepare a}} study of an Ypres Offensive on 15 March 1915. The study had warned that the capture of Ostend and Zeebrugge “would be a very {{difficult}} enterprise so far as the nature of the country is concerned” and if successful “would not materially improve the military situation of the Allies in the western theatre” except in the unlikely event that it prompted a general German withdrawal – more likely it would leave the British defending a longer line supplied by only two lines of railway, at “a grave disadvantage” and “in a rather dangerous position” <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> to the sea as the Germans counterattacked.|$|E
25|$|On some occasions, dholes may attack tigers. When {{confronted by}} dholes, tigers will seek refuge in trees or stand <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> {{to a tree}} or bush, where they may be mobbed for lengthy periods before finally {{attempting}} escape. Escaping tigers are usually killed, while tigers which stand their ground have a greater chance of survival. Tigers are dangerous opponents for dholes, as they have sufficient strength to kill a dhole with a single paw strike. Dhole packs may steal leopard kills, while leopards may kill dholes if they encounter them singly or in pairs. Since leopards are smaller than tigers and more likely hunt dholes, dhole packs tend to react more aggressively toward them than they do towards tigers.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} during the battle, the Partisans were caught in a pocket <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to the Neretva River. Near Jablanica, 20,000 Partisans under command of Marshal Josip Broz Tito {{struggled}} to save some 4500 wounded comrades and typhus patients together with the Supreme Headquarters and Main Hospital, against some 150,000 Axis combatants.|$|R

Several other people can be seen in the background, sitting at wooden picnic benches beneath the trees...|$|R
50|$|The {{penetrating}} partner {{sits in a}} chair. The receiving partner straddles penetrating {{partner and}} sits, facing the penetrating partner, feet on floor. This is sometimes called a lap dance, which is somewhat erroneous as a lap dance typically does not involve penetration. The receiving partner may also sit in reverse, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>back</b> to the penetrating partner.|$|R
