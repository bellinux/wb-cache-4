5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding out}} for 21 days, Davis was signed {{initially}} to a contract designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third preseason game on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and tripping over a goal post support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after to spike in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} in the state between radicals and conservatives continued throughout 1829 and 1830. After {{the failure of a}} state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build the railroad. After Congress tabled the measure, the debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Congress' support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay’s American System. The effect of the Webster–Hayne debate was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) {{effectively}} {{lifted the}} long-standing absinthe ban, {{and it has}} since approved many brands {{for sale in the}} US market. This was made possible partly through the TTB's clarification of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) thujone content regulations, which specify that finished food and beverages that contain Artemisia species must be thujone-free. In this context, the TTB considers a product thujone-free if the thujone content is less than 10 ppm (equal to 10mg/kg). This is verified through the use of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The brands Kubler and Lucid and their lawyers did most of the <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> absinthe legalized in the U.S., over the 2004-2007 time period.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E

25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then if it fails at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E

It's like the audience had gone away, and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back."

500|$|Critics were {{generally}} unimpressed with the series premiere.

[...] Similarly, Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten, signifying a [...] "bad" [...] rating. Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery, opining that while there were some potential in the show, it would [...] "take a lot more <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this show off the ground." [...] Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode, expressing that it was [...] "glossy" [...] but dull and mediocre. Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it's trying to peddle." [...] In conclusion, Blake and Nugent gave the episode a 'C' grade.|$|E
