The experience did not go as he expected, though he did come to the realisation that the core of his problems was his tendency to define himself based on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not, rather than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> said: [...] "Alive. everything else is negotiable." ...|$|R

5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing {{and that he}} has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across the treasure to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek the treasure and acting in full awareness of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E

5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave.

Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> experiencing in his life.|$|E
