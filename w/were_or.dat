5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates <b>were</b> <b>or</b> had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories {{to all three of}} the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms <b>were,</b> <b>or,</b> indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them <b>were,</b> <b>or</b> originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they <b>were</b> <b>or</b> to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E
