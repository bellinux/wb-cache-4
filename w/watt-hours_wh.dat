50|$|An {{electrical}} energy analyser might measure for single- and three-phase systems volts RMS, amps RMS, power factor, instantaneous power in watts (W), instantaneous volt-amperes (VA), reactive volt-amperes (VAr), frequency (Hz), average and maximum powers (W), harmonic distortion, energy in <b>watt-hours</b> (<b>Wh),</b> reactive volt-ampere-hours (VArh), and phase angles. Power- and energy-related parameters {{tend to be}} stated in kilowatts rather than watts - kW, kVA, kVAr, kWh, kVArh. For non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, some instruments can measure harmonics. The instrument, in addition to displaying values, may print or store them, network with other similar instruments at different locations, interact with computer software, etc.|$|E

In August of 2012, Cranfield University was awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with $ 810, 000 {{to produce a}} prototype of the Cranfield’s innovative Nano-membrane Toilet (NMT). Finally, the prototype {{is going to be}} exhibited at the “Reinvent the Toilet Fair” during 21 st and 22 nd of March 2014 in the Taj Palace Hotel, New Delhi (India). Cranfield’s NMT demands electricity for its daily performance. Nevertheless, it is targeted to off-grid communities. Consequently, a human-powered generator (HPG) was selected as a backup solution. The current MSc by Research aimed to design and test of a prototype of the aforesaid HPG. Moreover, to promote its usage, a portable power supply unit is designed to store energy and power small-loads like charging mobile phones and electric lighting. To select the most suitable design for our case study, a methodology using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution has been developed. As a result the plugged-in bike HPG alternative was selected. Next, prototypes of this generator and the portable power supply unit were developed, tested and shipped for display. While testing of the plugged-in generator and portable power supply unit, 26 <b>Watt-hours</b> (<b>Wh)</b> were harvested over 15 minutes, with its corresponding average charging power of 105 Watts. Nevertheless, the present study concludes 96 Wh as a more accurate energy level to be harvested during one hour of pedalling. Considering 96 Wh of energy, a round-trip battery efficiency of 70 % (lead-acid), and a NMT’s demand of 283 Wh; a 10 people household needs to pedal the HPG over 4 hours and 20 minutes. Nevertheless, if considering an 85 % inverter efficiency, 57. 12 Wh are available to fully charge one mobile phone (5. 6 Wh) and provide 4. 5 hours of room and desk lighting (11 Watts bulb) ...|$|E
50|$|Primary {{energy is}} the amount of {{extractable}} energy present in fuels as they are found in nature. It is often expressed in tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) or <b>watt-hour</b> (<b>Wh).</b> Unless stated otherwise the lower heating value is used in the remainder of this text. A portion of primary energy is converted into other forms before it is used, depending on the energy conversion efficiency of the installation and method employed this number differs significantly from the final energy as consumed by end users.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wh</b> (<b>watt-hours)</b> {{efficiency}} {{tests of}} UltraBattery in a stationary application for an electricity smart grid showed that over 30 cycles of charge-discharge at rates of 0.1 C10A, Wh efficiencies ranged from 91% to 94.5%, {{depending on the}} battery’s state of charge. REF This is compared with a Sandia National Laboratories study into lead-acid battery efficiency which found that traditional lead-acid batteries operating between 79% and 84% state-of-charge (the “top” charge mode to which traditional lead-acid batteries are generally restricted to prolong their life) achieve only 55% incremental charging efficiency.|$|R
