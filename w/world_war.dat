5|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>World</b> <b>War</b> II, the United States was a neutral party {{just as it was}} at {{the beginning}} of <b>World</b> <b>War</b> I. Unlike in <b>World</b> <b>War</b> I, however, the United States was involved in <b>World</b> <b>War</b> II in a military capacity for most of the war. Ten of the 464 men who received the Medal of Honor for action in <b>World</b> <b>War</b> II were educated at USMA.|$|E

5|$|The Commission only commemorates {{those who}} have died during the {{designated}} war years, while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service. The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First <b>World</b> <b>War</b> and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second <b>World</b> <b>War.</b> The end date for the First <b>World</b> <b>War</b> period is the official end of the war, while for the Second <b>World</b> <b>War</b> the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after VE Day as the official end of the First <b>World</b> <b>War</b> was after the 1918 Armistice.|$|E

5|$|The Second <b>World</b> <b>War</b> {{that broke}} out in 1939 {{consumed}} {{the attention of a}} new generation. Across most of the theatres of conflict, the participants attempted to respect the memorials to <b>World</b> <b>War</b> I. After the Second <b>World</b> <b>War</b> there was no equivalent mass construction of memorials to the war dead; instead, often local <b>World</b> <b>War</b> I memorials were adapted for use instead: additional names might be inscribed to the existing lists. In some cases, this resulted in memorials losing their exclusive focus on <b>World</b> <b>War</b> I. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington, for example, was expanded in 1950s to include corpses from the Second <b>World</b> <b>War</b> and Korea War, broadening the memorial's remit to commemorate most modern wars. In other cases, such as the Australian War Memorial, begun in the inter-war years but only opened in 1941, an essentially new memorial was formed to honour the multiple conflicts.|$|E
