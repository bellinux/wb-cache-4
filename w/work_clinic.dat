Sister Ann was supportive of the Second Vatican Council’s call for renewal of religious life and saw it as a “freeing opportunity for the sisters to live and work more closely with the communities they served. Sister Ann decided to take advantage of an ancient rite of the early Church for consecration of virgins that was restored by Vatican II, and in 1974 was consecrated by Humberto Cardinal Mediros of Boston and sent for with his blessings to become a sister living in the world, supporting herself, and ministering in the community.|$|E

40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi compreender a configura??o do ass?dio moral e suas implica??es no trabalho dos professores de uma institui??o p?blica de ensino {{superior}} de Manaus. O estudo baseou-se nos pressupostos te?rico-metodol?gicos da Psicodin?mica do Trabalho Dejouriana, que se caracteriza como pesquisa qualitativa. O m?todo utilizado foi a Cl?nica do Trabalho e da a??o, que propicia um espa?o de fala e escuta das viv?ncias de prazer e sofrimento no trabalho. Foram realizadas treze sess?es coletivas com os trabalhadores, sendo uma devolutiva. Os resultados da Cl?nica do Trabalho com os professores universit?rios sugerem n?o somente a rela??o entre o ass?dio moral e viv?ncias de sofrimento no trabalho, como tamb?m o adoecimento dos professores pesquisados em decorr?ncia da viol?ncia cotidiana a eles dirigida. Nas primeiras sess?es da cl?nica predominavam falas sobre o sofrimento de terem que lidar com superiores hier?rquicos autorit?rios que tentavam atingi-los, buscando desqualific?-los profissionalmente, marginaliz?-los e humilh?-los, restringindo-lhes a autonomia ou dificultando-lhes o andamento de projetos. Apontavam um ambiente de trabalho patog?nico, gerador de intenso sofrimento ps?quico e de danos ? sa?de f?sica e mental, resultando no adoecimento de servidores e no afastamento do trabalho por longos per?odos. Mostravam a rela??o entre os pares marcada pelo individualismo exacerbado, pela competi??o e pela falta de coopera??o. Relatavam o sentimento de solid?o decorrente do ass?dio moral, a discrimina??o de g?nero e o machismo nas rela??es de trabalho, a vulnerabilidade ante o ass?dio por serem migrantes, a meritocracia pautada pelo produtivismo acad?mico, o ensino compartimentalizado. Falaram de uma Gest?o desprovida de uma pol?tica institucional voltada para o coletivo, com caracter?sticas coronelistas, que privilegiava grupos, que negava o ass?dio moral, o sofrimento e o adoecimento no trabalho. No decorrer da cl?nica, houve a transposi??o da fala sobre o sofrimento pela perlabora??o deste. Ao longo das sess?es, o grupo passa a discutir o ass?dio moral no contexto das rela??es de trabalho. E passa a falar sobre o prazer de trabalhar advindo da rela??o com os alunos e da produ??o cientifica, e a realizar um movimento dirigido ? cria??o coletiva de estrat?gias de enfrentamento desse problema no ambiente de trabalho. Diante disso, pode-se inferir que a clinica atingiu os objetivos desejados. The {{objective of}} this research was to understand the configuration of bullying and its implications for the work of teachers of a public institution of higher education in Manaus. The study was based on theoretical and methodological principles of Dejourian psychodynamics work, which is characterized as qualitative research. The method used was the Work and Action Clinic, which provides a space to discuss and listen to their experiences of pleasure and suffering at work. We held thirteen group sessions with the workers, being one of them a feedback. The results of the <b>Work</b> <b>Clinic</b> with university professors not only suggest the relationship between bullying and the suffering experiences at work, but also the illness of teachers surveyed due to the daily violence directed to them. In the first sessions with this methodology there was the predominance of their speech about the suffering of dealing with authoritarian hierarchical superiors who tried to hurt them in person, seeking to disqualify them professionally, marginalize them and humiliate them by restricting their autonomy or hindering their progress in the project. They highlighted a pathogenic working environment of intense psychological distress, generator of intense psychic suffering and damage to physical and mental health, resulting in employees? illness, driving them away from work for long periods. They showed the relationship between the peers marked by exacerbated individualism, by competition and lack of cooperation. They reported the feeling of loneliness due to the harassment, gender discrimination and sexism in labor relations, the vulnerability of harassment for being migrants, meritocracy guided by academic productivism, the compartmentalized education. They spoke of a management devoid of an institutional policy for the collective, with colonelist features that privileged groups, which denied bullying, suffering and illness at work. In the course of the clinic, there was the transposition of the speech about the suffering by the perlaboration of this one. Throughout the sessions, the group starts discussing moral harassment in the context of working relationships. And he goes on to talk about the pleasure of working from the relationship with the students and the scientific production, and to carry out a movement aimed at the collective creation of strategies to cope with this problem in the work environment. Thus, we infer that the clinic sessions have reached the desired goals...|$|E
