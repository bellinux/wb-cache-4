5|$|I had the chills. I had a {{great feeling}} about it when we {{finished}} writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning... But we <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt something very special.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to at the time. The {{response}} was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E

25|$|The band cited bands such as Metallica, Pantera, Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Carcass, At the Gates, Acid Bath, Van Halen and Testament {{as their}} influences. When Kittie made their debut album, the band <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to bands such as Silverchair, Alice in Chains and Nirvana.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} the band <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> {{to more and more}} hip hop (Run DMC, Public Enemy and The Beastie Boys) as well as music from a new {{emerging}} movement of sample-heavy dance records (The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu, MARRS, S'Express and Bomb The Bass).|$|E
25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E

By 1968, the band {{had begun to}} {{incorporate}} different types of influences into their electric blues. [...] "If I would go to some cat's room," [...] remembered the guitarist about the band, [...] "he'd <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to Sly [...] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles.

25|$|Always {{known as}} much for his sarcastic grouchiness as his barbed self-deprecation, Morgan's 1994 memoir, Here's Morgan! The Original Bad Boy of Broadcasting, found him satirizing many of his former co-stars while {{straining}} not to examine his professional life beyond a series of in-and-out zaps, asides, and declarative statements—almost as if the reader <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to a vintage radio satire of Morgan's life.|$|E

Users could create a profile so their friends could see whom they were following, what they <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to, and what concerts they were going to. Ping also showed users' top 10 lists of songs and albums among the people they followed. It also provided artist recommendations to follow based on one's library and preference options.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} <b>were</b> <b>listening.</b> Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E

25|$|Another {{application}} was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were {{mounted on the}} torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer {{was added to the}} torpedo nose, and the microphones <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.|$|E
25|$|To {{look more}} closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport {{conducted}} another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.|$|E
25|$|After the 2008 season, coach Shanahan {{was fired}} and {{replaced}} by the Patriots' offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. On February 28, 2009, ESPN reported that the Broncos <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to trade offers for Cutler, a possibility he found upsetting. McDaniels denied interest in trades, but Cutler did not believe him. On March 15, Cutler listed his Colorado home for sale, and confirmed that he had officially asked the Broncos to trade him. On March 31, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen announced that the team would accommodate his request, and three days later Cutler was indeed traded with the Broncos' 2009 fifth-round draft pick to the Chicago Bears for quarterback Kyle Orton, the Bears' first- and third-round selections in 2009, and first-round pick in 2010. On October 20, Cutler and the Bears came to terms on a two-year contract extension worth $30 million, running through 2013.|$|E

25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two things that made his life bearable <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> to Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and {{watching}} the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E
