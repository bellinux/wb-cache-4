40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a weighing system used under {{the conditions in}} which various movements exist. These various movements are heaving motion, rolling motion, pitching motion, etc. In this paper, these various movements are collectively called as “vibration-like movement”. The term of “vibration-like moving conditions” means {{the conditions in which}} vibration-like movements exist. In the previous paper [1], the new <b>weighing</b> <b>method</b> was proposed. This method basically requires 4 loadcells which observe the vibration-like moving conditions. These loadcells are called as “dummy loadcell”.

In this paper, the estimating method of these velocities is explained in detail. We manufactured the weighing system which consists of a weighing loadcell and 3 dummy loadcells on trial.

We measured the volume of plastic bottles and 16 subjects (including two females), aged 18 - 42 years with each method.

The main justification given for the use of the modified method is that the conventional method underestimates loss to an unpredictable extent, depending on the degree to which pest-damaged grains retain a separate, countable identity. For example, it is shown that the degree to which the conventional method underestimated loss was much greater for a floury, small-grained variety, in which many insect-damaged grains were reduced to powder, than for a large- grained variety in which most damaged grains retained their identity. This implies that comparisons of weight losses based on the conventional med 1 od should be interpreted with great caution in studies with significant amounts of destroyed grains...|$|R
