Thereafter the analysis of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure based on the collected operational data was performed. Indicators characterizing the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure in the years 1995 - 2014 were determined. In the analysis the following parameters were used: length of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network, the number of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> connections, <b>water</b> consumption. The analysis was based on data get from the Central Statistical Office for 1995 ÷ 2014 [4]. The increase in the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network in Lubaczów in the considered period amounted 125, 8 %, while the average increase in the length of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network was 0, 3 km/year, per one inhabitant falls 1, 87 - 2, 38 m of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network. The value of the load intensity of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system in the Podkarpackie region in the years 1995 - 2009, as opposed to Lubaczów, showed an increasing trend. The length of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system per unit area was 0, 88 km/km 2 in 1995 and has grown to a value of 1, 11 km/km² in 2014.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new methodological {{approach of the}} ecological footprint explicitly addressing the sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>supplies,</b> which we call the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> footprint (WSF). The WSF calculates the catchment area or <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> hinterland of a certain society and {{can serve as a}} strategic planning tool for local or regional <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> linking the <b>water</b> demand with the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> in a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> footprint matrix. Based on regional water balances it estimates how much water can be appropriated for human use in an environmentally sustainable way. The proposed method is tested on the South East Queensland <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> in Australia, an area where water use restrictions are regularly imposed on the population. Applying the proposed method indicates that supply shortages may be avoided by considerably changing the organisation of <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> thereby reducing and possibly even avoiding the necessity for large-scale supply side measures like additional sweet water reservoirs or desalination plants. In that way it is demonstrated that the WSF method is applicable at an early and strategic stage of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> planning. No Full Tex...|$|R
