5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} after Eves’ {{election}} as leader, the Conservatives closed the gap in popular support considerably, placing only two percentage points behind the Liberals in two summer public opinion polls. By the autumn of 2002, however, Eves’ ‘honeymoon’ <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> was over, and the party fell back in the polls, hovering in the mid-to-high 30s, while the Liberals scored in the mid-to-high 40s.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} plagued by {{internal}} division and infighting, mainly over the issue over policy towards the European Union. The party's eurosceptic wing, represented by MPs such as John Redwood, opposed further EU integration, whilst the party's pro-European wing, represented by those such as Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, was broadly supportive. The issue {{of the creation of}} a single European currency also inflamed tensions, and these would continue to dog the party until the early-2000s (decade). These divisions gave off an impression of a divided party, which had lost touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense.

500|$|On May 27, {{the website}} Talking Points Memo posted a {{handwritten}} letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent {{to run for}} Senate. Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he wanted to discuss the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E
500|$|Some {{members of}} the Tories' {{campaign}} committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now {{a year in the}} past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care what went on in Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, [...] "That's the issue, and I'm making it." [...] Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been [...] "nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas". As the issue gained resonance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority {{should not be allowed to}} impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.|$|E

500|$|In {{assessing}} Davies's {{political career}} the historian Alun Morgan notes certain inconsistencies: while calling for unity among leftist factions, Davies frequently rebelled against agreed Labour Party policies. He championed democracy, individual {{liberty and the}} rights of small nations, yet gave the Soviet Union his unvarying and uncritical support. However, he was consistent in certain core areas, often in defiance of official Labour policy: unremitting hostility to US foreign policy, opposition to the party's post-war defence policies (specifically on issues concerning American bases in Britain, rearmament in West Germany, and [...] development of the Polaris submarine programme), and above all commitment to the needs and interests of his Merthyr constituents. His dedication to his own agenda brought him into frequent conflict with party managers, and led to withdrawals of the party whip throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Stating his position in a 1948 letter to the Labour Party general secretary Morgan Phillips, he wrote: [...] "Our movement embraces millions of men and women, and not merely a few hundred MPs and a few dozen... members of the National Executive. I am habitually inclined to give our millions my first thoughts and consideration." [...] Davies's popularity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of Merthyr Tydfil remained constant; he secured 75 per cent or more of the vote in each of the general elections of 1955, 1959, 1964 and 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The psephologist John Curtice wrote {{just before}} Corbyn's second {{leadership}} win: [...] "There is evidently {{a section of}} the British public, to be found particularly among younger voters, for whom the Labour leader does have an appeal; it just does not look like a section that is big enough, on its own at least, to enable Labour to win a general election". Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn [...] "incompetent" [...] than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was [...] "out of touch" [...] also. Martin Kettle of The Guardian [...] wrote that [...] "many Labour MPs, even some who face defeat, want an early election" [...] to prove decisively that Corbyn's Labour is unelectable as a government.

40|$|Abstract. We present SpeakUp, a novel way to cast {{a ballot}} remotely, using a {{personal}} computer connected to the Internet. SpeakUp is resistant to potential malware installed on <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> machine, addresses voter authentication, and offers some degree of protection against massive coercion. The main idea is that voters are required to read out loud a short text that is associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> candidate for whom they wish to vote. The voting server identifies <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> by <b>the</b> characteristics of their voice and identifies which text was read. <b>The</b> text, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> voice, is publicly posted on a bulletin board, and {{may serve as a}} receipt for a universally verifiable method of tallying. SpeakUp is based on the biometric characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> voice.

2500|$|Santa Fe Railroad {{officials}} had wired Sheriff Bat Masterson {{asking him to}} recruit a company of men to battle {{the forces of the}} Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad, which were contesting the right-of-way through the Royal Gorge near Pueblo, Colorado. As a Kansas sheriff, Bat had no authority in Colorado, but this did not prevent him from enlisting a large company of men. Among Masterson's recruits were such noted gunmen as Ben Thompson, [...] "Mysterious Dave" [...] Mather, John Joshua Webb, and (possibly) Doc Holliday. The end of Masterson's involvement came on June 12, 1879, when he surrendered a roundhouse his men were holding at Canon City, Colorado.

2500|$|His {{last term}} in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments and a view that Askin {{was getting out of}} touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> Late in 1974, Askin {{announced}} his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his Minister for Lands, Thomas Lewis, in his bid to be Askin's successor instead of the Deputy Leader and Minister for Education, Sir Eric Willis. It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askin's knighthood from Knight Commander (KCMG) to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted. Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as Premier. On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as Premier. [...] His resignation began a turbulent year for the government. [...] Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since World War I. Askin remains the only person to take the Coalition into more than one election as the sitting Liberal Premier.|$|E
2500|$|The Westchester County {{cities of}} Yonkers and Mount Vernon {{directly}} border {{the northern part}} of the Bronx and share much of that borough's heavily urbanized character. In 1894, the voters of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, along with voters in other parts of southern Westchester, took part in a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties (today's Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, respectively). At that time, the city consisted only of Manhattan and a portion of the present-day Bronx, which had been part of Westchester until it became part of New York City in 1874. While the results of the 1894 vote were positive elsewhere, including in several other adjacent sections of Westchester, which were then annexed to the city and which thus became part of the new borough of the Bronx, the returns were so negative in Yonkers and Mount Vernon that those two areas were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent municipalities. A subway connection was planned between Getty Square in downtown Yonkers and the New York City Subway, but the project was abandoned after the failed merger vote. Local residents frequently refer to the area as [...] "the sixth borough", referring to the two cities' location bordering the Bronx, the high number of local residents employed in Manhattan, and the area's similarly urban character.|$|E
