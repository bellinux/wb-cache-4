5|$|Because {{the filming}} {{was done by}} the actors using {{hand-held}} cameras, much of the footage is shaky, especially the final sequence in which a character is running down a set of stairs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Some audience members experienced motion sickness and even vomited as a result.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} chorus, Usher {{performs}} choreography in the club, {{backed up by}} several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards the camera in the laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is dancing in both the club and laser scene, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> also alternating to female's dancing in sync in the club.|$|E
5|$|Kirk's fight {{scene with}} Martia {{in the form}} of Kirk was mostly filmed with a double dressed in similar clothes; in the {{majority}} of the shots the camera allowed only one of the combatants' faces to be seen. When Kirk talked with his double directly, two separate takes of Shatner facing opposite directions were combined, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> motion carefully controlled so that the resulting image looked realistic.|$|E
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} series a grade of [...] "B", along with commenting on how relaxed <b>the</b> couple is <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> filming their every move.|$|R
50|$|Many {{companies}} manufactured {{cameras and}} equipment for use <b>with</b> <b>the</b> format. Many well-known brands such as Kodak, Canon and Agfa made cameras, projectors and stock for use <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
40|$|During the 13 shifts {{dedicated}} to observations of Comet Bradfield (including the two European shifts), five high dispersion exposures were obtained <b>with</b> <b>the</b> LWR <b>camera,</b> 27 low dispersion images <b>with</b> <b>the</b> LWR <b>camera,</b> and 36 low dispersion images <b>with</b> <b>the</b> SWP <b>camera</b> of which 5 were {{observations of the}} geocoronal background and 4 were taken in a serendipity mode while {{the nucleus of the}} comet was centered on the large aperture of <b>the</b> LWR <b>camera...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} premiered on MTV Live on May 12, 1998. The clip {{starts with the}} rising of the sun, until it {{progresses}} into the Koyaanisqatsi inspired section, featuring time-lapse images of daily life, from people riding a subway, ordering food, bowling, and children in a classroom to sped-up city-scapes and freeways at night. Interspersed in the scenes is Madonna dancing and singing the track, her image partially merged with {{the backdrop of the}} fast-sped cityscape. During the intermediate verse the high-speed motion stops <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> focusing on Madonna only against a sunset backdrop but quickly speeds up again. As the clip continues into nightfall, high-speed images of Madonna dancing in a discothèque is shown, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> focusing on the revelers, until she is seen falling asleep on the dance floor, and a revolving shot of planet Earth.|$|E
5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5000|$|The {{division}} of the 240-line system is academic as the scan ratio was determined entirely by {{the construction of the}} mechanical scanning system used <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> used <b>with</b> this transmission system.|$|R
5000|$|Slide Show: Players {{perform a}} scene {{on a set}} built at a 22-degree angle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> tilted to make the floor appear to be level. This game is played twice per episode.|$|R
50|$|Self Timer {{would be}} the ideal method but {{unfortunately}} the Pentax K-x HDR feature cannot be used <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> selftimer as it is not enabled in Firmware 1.01 and 1.02 for reasons unknown.|$|R
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{announced}} that they would support the game with downloadable content for at least 2 years. The DLC packs are both story-based and content-based, and added in elements that were cut from the base game, such as Shale, a stone-based companion who always gets stuck in doors and causes trouble <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> system. A crossover with Mass Effect 2, an item called the Blood Dragon Armor, is also available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
50|$|Melanie and Andreas Stuetz were {{equipped}} with two HD <b>cameras.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> they filmed both the flying {{scenes in the}} cockpit but were also filmed {{from the ground and}} during the flight from other aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, a multiple-camera setup can be used, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> showing <b>the</b> {{subject at}} {{different}} sizes. The footage from both cameras is then edited {{together to create}} the effect. As <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> cannot occupy <b>the</b> same space, {{there will always be}} a slight deviation from the axis. Moving <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> further away from the subject and using telephoto lenses can reduce the deviation.|$|R
50|$|Video Technician or <b>Camera</b> Shader - <b>The</b> Video Technician, {{sometimes}} called a V1, {{is in charge}} of all the cameras' iris and overall look of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> video. They can “shade” <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> for optimizing <b>the</b> color and unifying all the cameras’ colors and shade. The Video Technician also troubleshoots the issues that may arise <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> cable length and intercom.|$|R
5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Robert Carradine, David Carradine's younger half-brother, {{assisted}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> work. Greg Walker, former Kung Fu stunt coordinator, {{served as}} stunt coordinator and played {{one of the}} town's ruffians. Fran Ryan, whom Carradine met while they both worked on The Long Riders (1980), played a colonel in a scene that was shot several years after {{the main body of}} footage. Claire Townsend, a United Artists (UA) executive who had helped finance the film, played a lieutenant. Rick Van Ness, who had scouted the location, had a role as a Grateful Dead fan who gives the hero a ride. He also served as production manager.|$|E
50|$|A {{revised version}} was made, {{but it did}} not show clips of Taeyang dancing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grey dots, but new scenes of him dancing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> was shown instead. It was heavily edited, along with a scene of a hand holding alcohol.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{photo of}} a Smith & Wesson firing, taken with an air-gap flash. The photo was taken in a darkened room <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> shutter open, and the flash was {{triggered}} {{by the sound of}} the shot using a microphone.|$|R
50|$|An {{integral}} flash was fitted; this retracted {{into the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> on <b>the</b> left (from the user's perspective) and was manually extended via releasing a catch on <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> front. <b>The</b> unit had a guide number of 14 (at ISO 100 in meters) and featured auto-exposure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> light meter as well as supporting fill flash. Also on the front was a self-timer control.|$|R
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give {{the illusion of a}} planet. On maps where there is no fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{allows users}} to {{purchase}} and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> The user zooms {{in and out of}} photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{photograph}} on record in Denmark is credited to Peter Faber (1810–1877), a songwriter and {{a pioneer in}} telegraphy. His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum. The image of the square is in fact reversed left to right, as was normal for daguerreotypes unless a mirror was used together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Careful analysis of the photograph suggests that it dates back to July 1840. The exposure time of about 15 minutes in sunlight explains why the only figure to be seen is a man sleeping {{at the foot of}} the Pillar of Shame towards the left of the picture.|$|E

50|$|In late July 2009 {{there was}} a recall due to a problem that was {{discovered}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> power systems. <b>The</b> flaw would cause the system to cease powering on, both when running on battery or wall outlet power. For affected serial numbers see Nikon advisory.|$|R
50|$|GE X1 is <b>the</b> first <b>camera</b> from General Imaging for {{the more}} serious photographer. It has a 12X optical zoom, a 2.5-inch LCD screen, 8 megapixels, and a handgrip. Paired <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera’s</b> 12X optical zoom is a 4.5X digital zoom. Together, they give the X1 a maximum zoom of 54X. It also {{includes}} a 4-gigabyte SD/SDHC expansion slot.|$|R
5|$|Wings is {{also one}} of the first widely {{released}} films to show nudity. In the enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams, who can be seen from behind through a door which is opened and closed. Bow's breasts are revealed for a second during the Paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing her clothes. In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. A boom was built <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> mounted on an extension to shoot the Café de Paris scene.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
