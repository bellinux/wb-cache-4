25|$|The fast-growing I-4 {{corridor}} area, {{which runs}} through Central Florida and connects {{the cities of}} Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Tampa/St. Petersburg, has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion {{of the state and}} the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> the state of Florida in presidential elections.|$|E
25|$|Big Brother is a {{television}} reality game show {{based on an}} originally Dutch TV series {{of the same name}} created by producer John de Mol in 1997. The series follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who are living together in a custom-built home under constant surveillance. The HouseGuests are completely isolated from the outside world and can have no communication with those not in the house. The contestants are competing for a $500,000 grand prize, with weekly competitions and evictions determining <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> the show. The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984). The series launched on July 5, 2000 to a successful start, though ratings and critical reaction continued to grow increasingly negative. This led to the second season being a revamp of the show, featuring a more competition-based challenge. The series has since continued to be a hit for CBS, and is the second longest-running adaptation of the series to date, after the Spanish adaptation.|$|E
25|$|The format {{remains largely}} {{unchanged}} from previous seasons. HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to or from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> food, luxuries, and power in the House. The winner of the weekly Head of Household competition is immune from nominations and must nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest becomes Head of Household, {{he or she is}} ineligible {{to take part in the}} next Head of Household competition. HouseGuests also take part in competitions to earn food for the week. The losing team will be forced to eat Big Brother Slop for the week. This is the second season to feature Slop as the punishment food, as it was originally peanut butter and jelly. The winner of the Power of Veto competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercises the power, the Head of Household must then nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.|$|E

2500|$|In the Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, Dante is {{hired as}} the {{bodyguard}} {{of a young}} girl named Patty. While initially skeptical of his personality, Patty winds up growing attached to Dante and spends most of her time at his shop, often cleaning it or decorating it in a [...] "girly fashion", much to Dante's dismay. While Dante's main job during the series is to protect Patty, he {{spends most of his time}} doing odd jobs he receives at his shop (which has been renamed back to [...] "Devil May Cry" [...] sometime after the events of Devil May Cry). Lady appears, working as an independent Devil Hunter, to hire Dante in order to pay off a huge debt Dante owes. Trish also returns, and it's revealed that she has been working away from Dante for some time in order to try to establish a solo career as a Devil Hunter. Lady and Trish meet for the first time and do not get along right away. Despite this, the three wind up working together to take on certain difficult jobs. Near the end of the series it is revealed that Patty's mother is the descendant of a human sorcerer, who once sealed away the power of an ancient devil lord, Abigail. Eventually the demon Sid emerges as the villain of the series, and reveals his evil plot involving the sealed away power of Abigail. While Lady and Trish fight off demons summoned by Sid, Dante fights and kills Sid himself. Sometime later, Dante, Trish, and Lady all get hired on the same job and take bets on <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>win.</b> Patty comes into Dante's shop to clean, showing that the two continue to have a somewhat father-daughter type of relationship.|$|E
