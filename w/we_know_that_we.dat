I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|After {{her husband}} died, Russell retreated to her parents' home in Rhode Island. Her parents {{released}} a statement saying [...] "ur daughter has lost her husband today, {{the father of her}} child. We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. In the aftermath of the Patriot's Day horror, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted." [...] She refused to take custody of her husband's remains and has reverted to using her maiden name.|$|E
2500|$|In 1718, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, a renowned dog lover, also criticized Hales' work. In {{conversation}} with his friend, Joseph Spence, Pope reportedly said of Hale: [...] "He commits {{most of these}} barbarities {{with the thought of}} its being of use to man. But how do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a right to kill creatures that we are so little above as dogs, for our curiosity, or even for some use to us?". Pope, however was also a close friend of Hales [...] and considered him the model of the man who loves his God.|$|E
2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E

"Worse, Mike; {{for then}} <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be tried, but hoped that Louis would {{interfere}} in our favour, and by threatening reprisals obtain our liberty; whereas {{here we have}} only ourselves to depend upon, and the blow may come at any moment." ...|$|R

"By the way, doctor," [...] Hilda Covington said, [...] "we {{have taken}} Roberts into our confidence. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can rely upon his {{discretion}} implicitly, {{and it seemed}} to us that we must have somebody we can trust absolutely to watch this man." ...|$|E
60|$|All was ready, but we {{delayed for}} a time while each prayed silently and long, for <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were leaving the {{decision}} to God. I was not unaware of my own honesty and worth; but I was equally aware of the honesty and worth of my companions, so that it perplexed me how God could decide so fine-balanced and delicate a matter.|$|R
500|$|In an interview, Konietzko said: [...] "Mike and I {{were really}} {{interested}} in other epic 'Legends & Lore' properties, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{wanted to take a}} different approach to that type of genre. Our love for Japanese anime, Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar: The Last Airbender." ...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the very}} first day we started the six-card countdown, we always {{imagined}} the 6th being the elite album. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to make that vision become real.

60|$|Jav looked bewildered. He scarce knew {{whether he}} dare chance {{offending}} Komal or not, for so strong {{is the power}} of superstition that even though <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have been reverencing a sham, yet still we hesitate to admit the validity of our new-found convictions.|$|E

6000|$|... “There is {{no doubt}} about that,” the captain said. “Unless the wind drops or chops round our fate is sealed, and a few hours will see the ship {{grinding}} her bones on that rocky shore.

60|$|Our course {{had been}} altered, {{and we were}} rapidly {{approaching}} {{what appeared to be}} a precipitous headland. Cliffs, seemingly rising perpendicularly out of the sea, faded away into the mist upon either hand as we approached. The land before us might have been a continent, so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must be thousands of miles from the nearest western land-mass--New Zealand or Australia.|$|R

"Well, Squire, {{you may be}} sure, when <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had wronged him, how {{the wife}} and I fretted <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not <b>know</b> where to write to, nor how to set about finding out where he was, {{and so you can}} guess how pleased we were when we heard from you that he was with your regiment, and that he had saved your life at the risk of his own.|$|R

5000|$|Gaziano & Girling (G&G) {{have become}} the first shoemakers on Savile Row at number 39. They forged G&G in 2006, having been shoemakers in Northamptonshire.

5000|$|It was Neil Sedaka's {{success that}} did it, I think.
