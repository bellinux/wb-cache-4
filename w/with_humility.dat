25|$|The {{historian}} Sima Qian, {{who wrote}} Xiang Yu's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian, described Xiang {{as someone who}} boasted about his achievements and thought highly of himself. Xiang Yu preferred to depend on his personal abilities as opposed to learning <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> from others before him. Sima Qian thought that Xiang Yu had failed to see his own shortcomings and to make attempts to correct his mistakes, even until his death. Sima Qian {{thought that it was}} ridiculous when Xiang Yu claimed that his downfall was due to Heaven's will and not his personal failure.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the {{cultural}} adaptation of perspective include {{the view of the}} Virgin Mary as a mother <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> (rather than a heavenly queen) as the Franciscans began to preach in China, and its similarity to the local Chinese motherly and merciful figure of Kuanyin, which was much admired in south China. Another example is the Saint Juan Diego's account of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531 as a tanned Aztec princess who spoke in his local Nahuatl language. The clothing of the Virgin of Guadalupe image has been identified as that of an Aztec princess.|$|E

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 235, when Cao Gun fell sick, Cao Rui sent a palace {{physician}} to treat him, ordered his palace attendants to bring him various health products, and even instructed Cao Gun's mother Lady Du and brother Cao Lin to visit him. As Cao Gun's condition worsened, he maintained the same humility he showed throughout his life by {{saying that he was}} undeserving of such generosity from the emperor. Although he knew that his funeral had to be in accordance with Confucian traditions, he requested for a simple funeral and to be buried near the tomb of Quyuan (蘧瑗), a famous official from the Wey state in the Spring and Autumn period. Before his death, he told Cao Fu (曹孚), his son and heir apparent, to conduct himself <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> and virtue, to empathise with his subordinates and the common people, to respect his grandmother Lady Du and uncle Cao Lin, and to learn how to be a loyal and faithful subject of the emperor.|$|E

500|$|Van Eyck {{had earlier}} portrayed Rolin in the c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and the patron is {{recognizable}} from that work; both portraits show similar lips, a large chin and somewhat pointed ears. In van Eyck's portrait, Rolin {{is presented as}} perhaps pompous and arrogant; here– ten years later– he appears more thoughtful and concerned <b>with</b> <b>humility.</b> Campbell notes wryly that van der Weyden may {{have been able to}} disguise the sitter's ugliness and age, and that the unusual shape of his mouth may have been downplayed. He writes that while [...] "van Eyck impassively recorded, van der Weyden imposed a stylised and highly personal vision of the subject". Van Eyck's depiction was most likely the more accurate; van der Weyden embellished, mainly by lengthening the nose, enlarging the eyes and raising the eyebrows.|$|E

500|$|John Locke in his Essays on the Law of Nature {{argued that}} the {{widespread}} fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like [...] "follow your conscience" [...] supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: [...] "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid." [...] Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed {{on the basis of}} conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of the [...] "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" [...] that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of conscience, and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that [...] "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good." ...|$|E

2500|$|St. Augustine {{stresses}} the importance of humility {{in the study of the}} Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (De Doctrina Christiana, prooem. 4-7 [...] ). [...] Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (DDC, prooem. 7-8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (DDC, 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed <b>with</b> <b>humility,</b> because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC, 2.41.62).|$|E

2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{prevalence}} of the [...] "mateship" [...] culture is that Australian society is stringently anti-hierarchical. Australians are expected to behave <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> and not {{think of themselves as}} better than their peers. Any disloyalty to their [...] "mates" [...] is treated harshly, and is known as the tall poppy syndrome, where people who grow greater than their peers are harshly criticised as being narcissistic, or [...] "up themselves". Even the most successful and beautiful Australians are eager to proclaim how ordinary they are, to the extent that two-thirds of the highest earning households define themselves as middle class, lower middle class or even working class. This egalitarian social system makes Australian society appear [...] "laid-back" [...] or relaxed to visitors. Most forms of address are by first name or nickname, and only children regularly use titles such as [...] "Sir" [...] or [...] "Ma'am" [...] for authority figures.|$|E
2500|$|Highly {{influenced}} by Johann Arndt, Lewis Bayly, Jean de Labadie, and Theophil Großgebauer, Spener’s own writings display {{an emphasis on}} personal transformation through spiritual rebirth and renewal. It is this focus on individual devotion and piety that places him {{within the realm of}} Pietism. Spener wanted to strengthen and renew the church through the development of more knowledgeable and devoted members. [...] In his Pia Desideria, he gave six proposals of how to enact this reform: (1) to more thoroughly acquaint believers with scripture by means of private readings and study groups in addition to preaching; (2) to increase the involvement of laity in all functions of the church; (3) to emphasize that believers put into practice their faith and knowledge of God; (4) to approach religious discussions <b>with</b> <b>humility</b> and love, avoiding controversy whenever possible; (5) to ensure that pastors are both well-educated and pious; and (6) to focus preaching on developing faith in ordinary believers. As these proposals indicate, Spener saw positive change for the church as dependent primarily upon the pious involvement of individual believers.|$|E
