5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence {{suggested that the}} lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in which it had formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not belong in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E
5|$|Despite the honours and {{financial}} security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding {{a proxy for}} negotiations with the Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she addressed {{a letter to the}} Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, but in any case she failed to reunite <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of convention delegates drew 145,700 voters who elected, by county, 152 representatives. Thirty of these delegates were secessionists, thirty were unionists, and ninety-two were moderates {{who were not}} clearly identified <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the first two groups. Nevertheless, advocates of immediate secession were clearly outnumbered. Simultaneous to this election, the Confederate States of America was formed on February 4, 1861, by seven Southern slave states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas).|$|E

25|$|Those who {{had kept}} to {{traditional}} ways and spoke the Mikasuki language organized as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, gaining state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition in 1962.

Other Seminoles not affiliated <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the federally recognized groups are known as Traditional or Independent Seminoles.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Terrence Kaufman {{presented}} linguistic {{evidence suggesting}} that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of Totonacan or Mixe–Zoquean linguistic affiliation. He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe–Zoquean languages in many other Mesoamerican languages, whose people {{did not have any}} known history of contact <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the above-mentioned groups. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity, because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan {{both before and after the}} Classic period and not during the middle period.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage. In his Confessions, he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée, but never renewed his relationship <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> his concubines. Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage, saying {{that they could not}} live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at Cassiciacum, a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as Christianae vitae otium – the Christian life of leisure.|$|E

25|$|On 21 November 1974, two pubs were bombed in the Birmingham pub bombings (an act widely {{attributed}} to the IRA, but not claimed by them), which killed 21 civilians and injured 162. An inadequate warning was given for one bomb and no warning for the other. There were no military targets associated <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the pubs. The Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, and the Birmingham Six, were imprisoned for the Guildford and Birmingham bombings, respectively, but each group protested their innocence. They were eventually released and pardoned after serving lengthy prison sentences, even though the Balcombe Street group had admitted responsibility long before.|$|E
25|$|During 1938, the RAF {{had begun}} to receive its first {{deliveries}} of the Hurricane and Spitfire monoplanes; an emphasis was soon placed on quickly reequipping half of the Gladiator squadrons <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> these monoplane types. By {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the Gladiator had largely been replaced by the Hurricane and Spitfire in frontline RAF service. The introduction of these aircraft had been eased by the presence of the Gladiator, squadrons that had operated Gladiators prior to converting to the monoplane types experienced a noticeably improved accident record than those who converted from older types such as the Gauntlet. Experiences such as operating the Gladiator's landing flaps and familiarisation with its sliding hood have been attributed as having favourably impacted pilot conversion.|$|E
25|$|John Hawkins {{was born}} to a {{prominent}} family in Plymouth in the county of Devon. He was the second Bastard of William Hawkins (b. before 1490, d. 1554/5) and Joan Trelawny, daughter and sole heir of Roger Trelawny of Brighton, Cornwall. William Hawkins was a merchant, shipowner and sea captain who successfully avoided permanent entanglement <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the religious factions in the English Reformation, serving in Parliament under both Henry VIII and Mary I. William was especially {{well known in the}} court of Henry VIII as one of the principal sea captains, dating from his voyage to the New World in about 1527 (a first for an Englishman). The young John and his older brother grew up following their father's trade.|$|E
