60|$|But though I {{have come}} to a point where the problem of a Utopia has {{resolved}} itself very simply into the problem of government and direction, I find I have not brought the botanist with me. Frankly he cannot think so steadily onward as I can. I feel to think, he thinks to feel. It is I and my kind that have the wider range, because we can be impersonal as well as personal. We can escape ourselves. In general terms, at least, I understand him, but he does not understand me in any way at all. He thinks me an incomprehensible brute because his obsession is merely one of my incidental interests, and wherever my reasoning ceases to be explicit and full, the slightest ellipsis, the most transitory digression, he evades me and is back at himself again. He may have a personal liking for me, though I doubt it, but also he hates me pretty distinctly, because of this bias he cannot understand. My philosophical insistence that things shall be reasonable and hang together, that what can be explained shall be explained, and that what can be done by calculation and certain methods shall not be left to chance, he loathes. He just wants adventurously to feel. He wants to feel the sunset, and he thinks that on the whole he would feel it better if he had not been taught the sun was about ninety-two million miles away. He wants to feel free and strong, and he would rather feel so than be so. He does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> great things, but to have dazzling things occur to him. He does not know that there are feelings also up in the clear air of the philosophic mountains, in the long ascents of effort and design. He does not know that thought itself is only a finer sort of feeling than his--good hock to the mixed gin, porter and treacle of his emotions, a perception of similitudes and oppositions that carries even thrills. And naturally he broods on the source of all his most copious feelings and emotions, women, and particularly upon the woman who has most made him feel. He forces me also to that.|$|E

50|$|After research, the {{designer}} must {{make sense of}} the data they've collected. Typically this is done through modeling of the users and their environments. User modeling or personas are composite archetypes based on behavior patterns uncovered during research. Personas provide designers a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave, how they think, what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> and why. Once created, personas help {{the designer}} to understand the users' goals in specific contexts, which is particularly useful during ideation and for validating design concepts. Other types of models include work flow models, artifact models, and physical models.|$|E

Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a psychological test). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate research design. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see data analysis), and how to interpret and report the results (see scientific publishing).|$|E
50|$|Hart and Gable {{examined}} {{the effect of}} low and high motivational intensity on positive affect.

Results indicated that high motivational intensity positive affect lead to more successful goal pursuit and occurred only when task goals were explicitly stated. No effect occurred in the neutral condition, which suggests that motivational intensity alone did not impact goal pursuit.|$|E

50|$|The {{platform}} provides applications with {{a number}} of high-level abstractions, through which the applications can learn {{about the state of the}} network and through which they can control the flow of traffic through the network. The network graph abstraction provides information about the structure and topology of the network. The flow objective is a device-centric abstraction that allows applications to direct flow of traffic through a specific device without the need to be aware of the device table pipeline. Similarly, the intent is a network-centric abstraction that gives application programmers the ability to control network by specifying what they wish to accomplish rather than specifying how they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> it. This simplifies application development and at the same time provides the platform with added degrees of freedom to resolve what would normally be considered conflicting requests.|$|E

30|$|Utility {{has been}} defined as the {{functionality}} or capability of the system (Grudin 1992), related to the tasks the user <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> with the system. Thus, usability and utility are separate concepts. This also means that an interface may have zero usability but still a high utility. For example, a software program may offer all the functions a user needs, but the interface is so bad, that the user is unable to access this function. The other way around, a highly usable interface may have no utility. Usefulness comprises both usability and utility. Accordingly, a system is useful, if it provides the functionality to support the tasks, the user <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish,</b> and if the user can employ these function in an easy (e.g. efficient, effective) and pleasurable manner.|$|R

50|$|Before more {{comprehensive}} medical treatment was available, full amputation {{of the legs}} at the hip was often performed. More recently, the 'amputation' (actually a disarticulation because no cutting of the bone is involved) is done at the knee {{for those who have}} bent knee positions and webbing between thigh and calf to enable more ease of mobility and better seating. Some children with knee disarticulation use prosthetic legs to walk. Prosthetics for children without substantial hip and trunk control is usually abandoned in favor of faster and easier wheelchair mobility as the child's weight and age increases. Children may 'walk' on their hands and generally are able to climb and move about to accomplish whatever they need and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish.</b> Children more mildly affected may have normal gait and no need for assistive devices for walking. Others may walk with bracing or crutches.|$|E
50|$|Her {{point is}} not {{that there are no}} {{physical}} or muscular differences between the sexes, but rather that women have a different mindset when it comes to performing tasks. They do not see themselves as capable, do not “summon the full possibilities of our muscular coordination, position, poise, and bearing”, do not put their whole bodies into it with the ease that men do. So, when someone says that they throw like a girl, climb like a girl, hit like a girl, etc. it is not a compliment. It means that the person is not putting their whole body into it, that it is falling short. Young says that women tend to wait for and react to things, rather than meeting them. They lack confidence; they hesitate; they think of their bodies as fragile. This keeps them distracted from paying attention to what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish.</b> This extends beyond sports to other realms of life as well.|$|E

He states that [...] "the Jew will not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God."

Hayward, after another [...] "we're sorry" [...] campaign, determines that they will need to drill on the Moon in order to change the gravitational pull on the Earth and quell the swells on the ocean, which will allow them to place a cap on the gateway. Unfortunately, in the act of doing this, they inadvertently release Cthulhu, bringing 3000 years of darkness to earth, forcing Hayward to send out a third [...] "we're sorry" [...] campaign.

Byomkesh has noticed a rather unusual advertisement hidden away in the classifieds section of the Dainik Kalketu daily with the heading Pother Kanta (Thorn of the Road). Translated the ad reads, [...] "If anyone wants to remove the Thorn of the Road, stand next to and hold on to the lamp-post on the southwest corner of the Whiteway-Ladley store on Saturday evening at 5:30." [...] Byomkesh had noticed this peculiar ad being published without fail every Friday for the previous three months. Byomkesh immediately inferred that the person posting the add went to great pains to remain anonymous and chose this cryptic message on purpose. He also selected a meeting place in the centre of Hogg's Market in Calcutta at a very busy time of the day, so that he could pass by the responder without being detected. Byomkesh guessed that the advertiser would probably want to slip something into the responder's pocket, perhaps some instructions, and would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>accomplish</b> this without being detected.
