5|$|Goaltenders {{have participated}} in the offence, albeit in a limited <b>way,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} days of the sport. Before the creation of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 196667 NHL season. During the history of the league, there had been some near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming at the empty net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to a teammate by later video review.|$|E

25|$|Pottery {{is a very}} {{traditional}} craft and is practices {{in many of the}} communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water containers, pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items.

The best quality ware is considered {{to be made in the}} central valleys in municipalities such as Zacualpan, Nuitzalapa, Atzacualoya, and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing.

The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies. By failing to increase mileage standards in a meaningful <b>way</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and now interfering in California, the federal government had again served short-term industry interests at the expense of long-range leadership on issues of oil dependency and cleaner cars.|$|E

25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach {{is the assumption that}} the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to the determination of the effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent <b>way,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E
25|$|Today, Idaho's largest {{industry}} is {{the science and}} technology sector. It accounts for over 25% of the state's revenue and over 70% of the state's exports. Idaho's industrial economy is growing, with high-tech products leading the <b>way.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s, Boise {{has emerged as a}} center for semiconductor manufacturing. Boise is the home of Micron Technology, the only U.S.manufacturer of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. Micron at one time manufactured desktop computers, but with very limited success. Hewlett-Packard has operated a large plant in Boise since the 1970s, which is devoted primarily to LaserJet printers production. Boise-based Clearwater Analytics is another rapidly growing investment accounting and reporting software firm, reporting on over $1 trillion in assets. ON Semiconductor, whose worldwide headquarters in Pocatello, is a widely recognized innovator in modern integrated mixed-signal semiconductor products, mixed-signal foundry services, and structured digital products. Coldwater Creek, a women's clothing retailer, is headquartered in Sandpoint. Sun Microsystems (now a part of Oracle Corporation) has two offices in Boise and a parts depot in Pocatello. Sun brings $4million in annual salaries and over $300million of revenue to the state each year.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} base for special effects was Century 21 Studios in Slough, Berkshire, {{which had been}} prepared for filming on the last Supermarionation series, The Secret Service. Supervising director Derek Meddings oversaw the shooting of more than 200 effects shots, including the destruction of EUROSEC Headquarters {{at the end of}} the film. A six-foot (1.8m) Phoenix scale model, which emulated the design of the NASA multi-stage Saturn V rocket, had to be rebuilt after unexpectedly igniting and nearly injuring a technician. For authenticity, the effects staff mounted the shots of the Phoenix lift-off outdoors in a section of the Century 21 car park so as to film against a genuine sky backdrop. Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as [...] "one of the most spectacular" [...] of its kind produced by Century 21. Sylvia Anderson, who considers it indistinguishable from a Cape Kennedy launch, comments that she is [...] "still impressed by the magic of the effects.

Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011, he was contacted by Gaga's management and {{they wanted him to}} play on Born This <b>Way.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself.

She simply told Clemons, [...] "We'll put the tape on and you just play". The recording concluded by 3 a.m. after a few takes.

Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some <b>way</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E
