5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E

The stained-glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and calcimine for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork.

5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage.

40|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the}} {{important}} components of building for ventilation. <b>Windows</b> <b>are</b> of various type depending up on materials, purpose and opening types.

Cost of aluminum window depends upon the section size and thickness used for the <b>window.</b> Aluminum <b>window</b> <b>are</b> not energy efficient and not sound resistance but it is light weight, low cost, rustproof, and required less maintains and painting. Aluminum <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> commonly recommended for building where high degree of elegance <b>is</b> required. UPVC <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> the un plasticized polyvinyl chloride. Now a day’s UPVC <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> becoming more popularly used because of high energy efficient, excellent appearance and smooth surface. But they are costly as compare to wooden and aluminum and they are not that flexible in design and execution. A case study was also done to see the suitability and economy of all these three types of <b>windows</b> and it <b>was</b> found that the aluminum <b>window</b> <b>was</b> best suited for construction, as it has low cost, easily available & can demolded in any shape & size. Also it has high degree of elegance and good appearance when powder coated...|$|R

5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the cathedral's sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord's Passion. Given by J.J. Braga, a parishioner from Portugal, it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997–2002 renovation. The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints because it was the most thematically similar, in that the martyrs gave up their lives for the faith, emulating Jesus' {{sacrifice}} to save mankind. New stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> installed depicting the saints.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers.

Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
