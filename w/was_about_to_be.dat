5|$|At 01:44, as Mikawa's ships headed {{towards the}} Allied {{northern}} force, Tenryū and Yūbari split {{from the rest}} of the Japanese column and took a more westward course. Furutaka, either because of a steering problem, or to avoid a possible collision with Canberra, followed Yūbari and Tenryū. Thus, the Allied northern force <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enveloped and attacked from two sides.|$|E

5|$|In July 1943, the Montenegrin Partisan leader Đilas {{contacted}} both Ostojić and Baćović {{to establish}} their willingness to work jointly against the Axis occupiers, given that a new government-in-exile <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established without Mihailović.

5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was {{the addition of a}} plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E
5|$|By 28 February 1943, 2,807 of the 8,137 Chetniks {{operating}} in northern Dalmatia {{as part of}} the Italian Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia (MVAC) XVIIth Corps were under Baćović's command. In July 1943, Montenegrin Partisan leader Milovan Đilas contacted both Baćović and Ostojić to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Germans and Italians, given that a new Yugoslav government-in-exile <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established in London without Mihailović. Baćović and Ostojić reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organization if they maintained contact with the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, Bohr helped {{refugees}} from Nazism. After Denmark {{was occupied by}} the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become {{the head of the}} German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uncovered. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E

His {{decision}} to become an attorney was a partial result of his time as a journalist, as he realized that, while he could expose corruption, he could not change it. Gore did not complete law school, deciding abruptly, in 1976, to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when he found out that his father's former seat in the House <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vacated.|$|E
5|$|In March 1982 Massino was {{tipped off}} by a Colombo-associated FBI insider that he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indicted and went into hiding in Pennsylvania with Leisenheimer. On March 25, 1982, Massino was also charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Indelicato, Giaccone and Trinchera and truck hijacking. In hiding, Massino {{was able to see}} the prosecution's strategy and better plan his defense as well as eventually face trial without association with other mobsters. Pistone later speculated Massino also feared retaliation upon the revelation that his associate Raymond Wean had turned state's evidence. Massino was visited by many fellow mobsters, including Gotti, and Vitale would secretly deliver cash to support him.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 Labour Party {{leadership}} election, Benn {{backed the}} left-wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid.

In October 2007, at the age of 82, and when it appeared that a general election <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election in 2007, and the constituency was subsequently abolished.|$|E

However, he is blocked by Aaron Starkey (Glenn Morshower), a social worker. That night, Paula dies when a man enters her room. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) locates Dara's birth records and reveals {{that she was a}} quadruplet. Shortly thereafter, Starkey reveals that Paula <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adopted by Father Gregory. When the agents visit the priest, he insists he was trying to protect Paula from harm. Later, while examining Paula's body, Scully experiences a vision of her daughter Emily (Lauren Diewold).|$|E
5|$|Moltke was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Wollante. Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed and his fleet <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seized by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.|$|E
5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> phased into use on the main domestic routes by Scandinavian Airlines System and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E

He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised that he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} {{that no one would}} employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E
