5|$|Freestyle {{skiing is}} one of the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the <b>Winter</b> Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, the first <b>Winter</b> Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 <b>Winter</b> Olympics, in Albertville, France, were freestyle skiing events first held as official medal events. Before that, freestyle skiing was contested at the 1988 <b>Winter</b> Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official freestyle skiing medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 <b>Winter</b> Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every <b>Winter</b> Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the <b>Winter</b> Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 <b>Winter</b> Olympics.|$|E
