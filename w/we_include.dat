25|$|In three {{dimensions}} this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, {{the situation is}} somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated. Despite the small dimension, we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; {{and we also have}} some freedom in the choice of angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When <b>we</b> <b>include</b> the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.|$|E
25|$|In topology, the Vietoris–Rips complex, {{also called}} the Vietoris complex or Rips complex, is an {{abstract}} simplicial complex that can be defined from any metric space M and distance δ by forming a simplex for every finite set of points that has diameter at most δ. That is, it is a family of finite subsets of M, in which we think of a subset of k points as forming a (k1)-dimensional simplex (an edge for two points, a triangle for three points, a tetrahedron for four points, etc.); if a finite set S has the property that the distance between every pair of points in S is at most δ, then <b>we</b> <b>include</b> S as a simplex in the complex.|$|E

500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when <b>we</b> <b>include</b> (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first.

500|$|The {{stage was}} as huge as {{a tennis court}} and was made movable. Above the stage was a vast {{electrical}} grid, composed of truss sections, chain motors, electrical cables and the control devices that linked electronically or mechanically with the performances happening below. Four gigantic video monitors formed {{the backdrop of the}} stage. Other equipment included a mechanical bull and equipment for aerial movements. The sets were built in sections by three companies. A permanent crew of around hundred was hired. Monitor mixing was handled by four monitor engineers, with two of them for Madonna's monitors. Blake Suib, one of the engineers, commented that Madonna was a perfectionist and she knew when a sound, coming from the speakers, sounded bad or good during rehearsals. By the suggestion of music director Pat Leonard, they tried out using 14kHz of sound frequency in their live speakers, which was unusual to use at that point of time. Also they {{came up with the idea}} of using isolated amplifiers to pick up the sound of the instruments individually. Suib commented that [...] "the creative process of coming up with new ideas, implementing them, and then soberly evaluating their results was time-consuming but worth it." [...] The poster and the logo for the tour was developed by Chase Design Group. They wanted to make the logo as much aesthetic as possible. They developed a custom icon and logo type to convey the unique and ethereal qualities of Madonna's show, which was described by the group's founder Margo Chase as [...] "a multilayered musical and spiritual journey through diverse worlds." [...] Chase commented that since [...] "Madonna is a student of Kabbalah, she requested that <b>we</b> <b>include</b> references to that body of knowledge." [...] The resulting logo and poster included both Arabic and Hebrew references. A number of designs were prepared by Chase and the one ultimately chosen by Madonna made it to the main poster of the show, which featured Madonna's face-shot from the [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] video shots.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the field}} F is not algebraically closed, {{the point of}} view of {{function}} fields is a little more general than that of considering the locus of points, since <b>we</b> <b>include,</b> for instance, [...] "curves" [...] with no points on them. For example, if the base field F is the field R of real numbers, then x2+y2=−1 defines an algebraic extension field of R(x), but the corresponding curve considered as a subset of R2 has no points. The equation x2+y2=−1 does define an irreducible algebraic curve over R in the scheme sense (an integral, separated one-dimensional schemes of finite type over R). In this sense, the one-to-one correspondence between irreducible algebraic curves over F (up to birational equivalence) and algebraic function fields in one variable over F holds in general.|$|E

[...] Often mentioned in Philippine literature, these four represent the struggle, perception and character of how {{it is to be}} a woman in Philippine society. [...] Gabriela Silang was a katipunera or a revolutionary – a representation of female bravery – who fought against Spanish colonialism in the 18th century. [...] Silang was a contrast to the chaste and religiously devout image of the Filipino lady as portrayed by Jose Rizal through his Spanish-language novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. [...] Within the pages of these 19th century novels, Rizal depicted Leonor Rivera - a girlfriend of his - through the fictional character of Maria Clara as the epitome of virtue, i.e., the ideal Filipina. [...] Then there was the arrival of Imelda Marcos – the “beauty queen and dictator’s wife … a power-seeking type of woman…” – after that, the country saw the advent and rise of Corazon C. Aquino, the first woman president in Asia and the Philippines – the elected 1986 replacement of a male despot, Ferdinand Marcos. [...] Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, after two male presidents (Fidel V. Ramos and Joseph Estrada, respectively), followed in the footsteps of Corazon Aquino to become a leader and political figure of an Asian nation.|$|E

60|$|Now if we bear {{this idea}} of a {{cementing}} function firmly in mind, we shall have a criterion by which to judge what shall be omitted from and what shall {{be included in the}} Books of Literature in this modern Bible of ours. We shall begin, of course, by levying toll upon the Old and New Testaments. I do not think I need justify that step. I suppose {{that there will be no}} doubt of the inclusion of many of the Psalms--but I question if we should include them all--and of a number of splendid passages from the Prophets. Should <b>we</b> <b>include</b> the Song of Songs? I am inclined to think that the compilers of a new Bible would hesitate at that. Should <b>we</b> <b>include</b> the Book of Job? That I think would be a very difficult question indeed for our compilers. The Book of Job is a very wonderful and beautiful discussion of the profound problem of evil in the world. It is a tremendous exercise to read and understand, but is it universally necessary? I am disposed to think that the Book of Job, possibly with the illustrations of Blake, would not make a part of our Canon but would rank among our Great Books. It is a part of a very large literature of discussion, of which I shall have more to say in a moment. So too I question if we should make the story of Ruth or the story of Esther fundamental teaching for our world civilization. Daniel, again, I imagine relegated to the Apocrypha.
