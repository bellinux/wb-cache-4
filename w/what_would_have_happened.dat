5|$|Typhoon Imbudo was {{the strongest}} typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left {{widespread}} areas flooded for several days. Cagayan Valley was largely isolated after a bridge was damaged in Ilocos Norte. Damage was heavy in the region, totaling P2.2billion (PHP, $40million USD), and over 80,000people were displaced by the storm. Damage was heaviest in Isabela, where damage was estimated at P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD), mostly to crops and killed livestock. There, winds and rain knocked down trees and caused a province-wide power outage. Most trees {{less than three years}} old fell during the high winds. In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, and most of the corn and rice crops were heavily damaged.

25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers {{would still have to}} drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E

40|$|The high {{prevalence}} {{and costs of}} type 2 diabetes makes it a rapidly evolving focus of policy action. Health systems, employers, community organizations, and public agencies have increasingly looked to translate the benefits of promising research interventions into innovative policies intended to prevent or control diabetes. Though guided by research, these health policies provide no guarantee of effectiveness and may have opportunity costs or unintended consequences. Natural experiments use pragmatic and available data sources to compare specific policies to other policy alternatives or predictions of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> {{in the absence of}} any intervention. The Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D) Study is a network of academic, community, industry, and policy partners, collaborating to advance the methods and practice of natural experimental research, with a shared aim of identifying and prioritizing the best policies to prevent and control diabetes. This manuscript describes the NEXT-D Study group's multi-sector natural experiments in areas of diabetes prevention or control as case examples to illustrate the selection, design, analysis, and challenges inherent to natural experimental study approaches to inform development or evaluation of health policies.

There is, however, scant information on the effectiveness of previous support for export development to inform the design of new initiatives. In this paper, we exploit information on product specific technical assistance for trade and estimate a simple partial equilibrium model to assess the impact on the key measurable outcome - exports of the product subject to assistance. We apply a difference in differences approach to isolate the impact of the policy interventions and draw four main conclusions: on average, export development (ED) programs have coincided with or predated stronger export performance; such programs appear to be more effective where there is already significant export activity; there is some concern about the additionality of the programs and that support may be being channeled to sectors that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> prospered anyway; ultimately, conclusions strongly depend on <b>what</b> one postulates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> {{in the absence of the}} policy intervention, so the definition of a credible counterfactual is of utmost importance for the evaluation of technical assistance for exports. aid for trade, export development, difference in differences, developing countries,...|$|R
