5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E

Rigby had arrived at Woolwich Arsenal station at 14:10 and <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> Wellington Street towards the Barracks.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the street and having {{a hell of a}} lot of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
500|$|On December 7, 1982, Rathbun <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> Market Street {{carrying}} {{a bag of}} brownies when she by chance met {{one of the officers}} who had originally arrested her in 1981. [...] Rathbun {{was on her way to}} deliver cannabis brownies for a friend who had cancer and was suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy. [...] The officer inquired as to the contents of her bag and found her in possession of four dozen cannabis brownies. She was taken to the city jail and held on multiple counts of possession and violation of her probation. The district attorney eventually dropped the charges.|$|E

500|$|He <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> a quiet {{suburban}} {{street on}} his way home after his usual evening teaching session. He noticed three youths hovering several yards away {{on the opposite side of}} the street. When they approached him he was ready. [...] "Give us your money, or you'll get hurt" [...] said the leader of the three. Abbe looked at each one in turn, then casually took his wallet out of his jacket pocket, throwing it on the floor between himself and the antagonists. He pointed to the wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?" [...] The three would-be attackers looked at the wallet on the floor, then at Abbe and then at each other and then moved away. Abbe picked up his wallet and calmly walked home.|$|E
500|$|According to Geisel, he <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> Madison Avenue in New York City after {{learning}} of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old Dartmouth College classmate. McClintock had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's president James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, [...] "If I had been walking {{down the other side}} of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today." [...] In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night one of us <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
5000|$|In the Star Trek episode [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", {{there is}} {{a scene in which}} Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and guest star Joan Collins <b>are</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> a street {{supposedly}} located in New York City during the 1930s. As they <b>are</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the sidewalk, a glass window clearly marked [...] "Floyd's Barber Shop" [...] is visible briefly. This is because both series used the outdoor Desilu Studios lot that was originally constructed as [...] "Atlanta" [...] in the film Gone with the Wind (1939).|$|R

500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He {{said he was a}} freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw {{a cup of hot}} coffee in his face as he <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the street.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

2500|$|On September 27, 1876, {{at the age}} of 59, Bragg <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> {{a street}} with a friend in Galveston, Texas, when he {{suddenly}} fell over unconscious. Dragged into a drugstore, he was dead within 10 to 15 minutes. A physician familiar with his history believe that he [...] "died by the brain" [...] (or of [...] "paralysis of the brain"), suffering from the degeneration of cerebral blood vessels. An inquest ruled that his death was due to [...] "fatal syncope," [...] possibly induced by organic disease of the heart. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, Mobile, Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|O'Brien, citing three {{anonymous}} {{people who}} worked with Trump, wrote {{in the book that}} Trump [...] "was not remotely close to being a billionaire," [...] stating that his actual net worth ranged between $150 million and $250 million.

I kept thinking, 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] O'Brien also stated that Trump was once asked by boxer Mike Tyson if he had an affair with his wife, Robin Givens. O'Brien quoted Trump: [...] "He said, 'Could I ask you, Are you fucking my wife?' Now, if I froze, I'm dead ... You would have zero chance. Here's the heavyweight champion of the world, and he's a solid piece of fucking armor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{oral history}} {{talks about the}} Great Flood also. [...] In a story said to happen at Chʼiyáḵmesh (Cheakamus), in the Squamish Valley, [...] a man who survived the flood <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the river, feeling {{depressed}} {{about the loss of}} his people from the flood. Then the Thunderbird helped him and gave him food. He continued down the river, with his food gathered by the Thunderbird, when the Thunderbird told him where to stay, and that he would give him a wife. That is where the people of Chʼiyáḵmesh came from. In another story of the first ancestors, two men first appeared at Chekw’élhp and Sch’enḵ, located at what is now known as Gibsons, British Columbia. The first man to appear here was Tseḵanchtn, then the second man appeared named Sx̱eláltn. [...] The people repopulated the land with large families and many Squamish people claim descent from these ancestors.|$|E
2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1907, the 50-year-old Émile Cohl, like {{everyone}} else in Paris, had become aware of motion pictures. How he actually entered the business is shrouded in legend. According to Jean-Georges Auriol in a book of 1930, one day Cohl <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>down</b> the street when he spotted a poster advertising a movie obviously stolen from one of his strips. [...] Outraged, he confronted the manager of the offending studio (Gaumont) and was hired on the spot as a scenarist (responsible for one-page story ideas for movies). The story is rather doubtful in the detail of which strip and which short film; {{it is also possible that}} the story is completely false, and that Cohl was approached for the job, either by director Etienne Arnaud or by artistic director Louis Feuillade, both of whom had once worked for caricature papers and therefore could be expected to know Cohl by reputation if not personally.|$|E
