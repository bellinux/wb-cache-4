5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to an airline representative at the counters.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, {{he would have to}} write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The number-one {{contender}} to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship {{was determined}} at Turning Point, with Christian Cage being pitted against Monty Brown. At Genesis, Brown defeated Jeff Hardy to become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Also at Genesis, Christian Cage made his {{debut in the}} company, proclaiming he came to TNA to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, Cage reiterated his statement from Genesis, which angered Brown in the storyline. Brown said that Cage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through him {{in order to get}} a title shot before the segment resulted in a fight between the two. Cage requested the match against Brown from NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko on the November26, 2005 episode of Impact!, which he was granted.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{throughout}} Italy {{went through}} many {{changes in the}} late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the Milanese banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> bankrupt without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria Milanese.|$|R
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{through with the}} new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements {{in place of the}} old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet 1st and 3rd Guard Armies, in {{conjunction}} with the Soviet 6th Army, launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Despite early troubles due to stubborn resistance from Italian troops, the Red Army was able to partially overrun the Italian 8th Army by 18 December. The breakthrough -even if small and quickly contained- proved a possible threat to Army Group Don's left flank, while the city of Rostov was threatened by the 3rd Guards Army. This, and mainly heavy losses sustained by the German armor divisions forcing their way to the Myshkova river, forced Manstein to reconsider continuing the offensive. The German field marshal decided that he could not defend his left flank while also sustaining the attempt to relieve the 6th Army. Although the 6th Panzer Division was able to cross the Myshkova River by the night of 19 December, the LVII Panzer Corps had still not made major advances against increased Soviet opposition, despite the arrival of the 17th Panzer Division; in fact, {{it seemed as if the}} corps <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the defensive. Furthermore, the Soviet raid on Tatsinskaya managed to destroy the airfield and several dozen aircraft being used by the Luftwaffe to resupply forces inside the Stalingrad pocket, forcing Manstein to order the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the defensive, instead of reserving it to bolster his forces directed toward the breakthrough to Stalingrad. To make matters worse for the Germans, on 18 December Hitler refused to allow the German 6th Army to begin a breakout operation towards the rest of Army Group Don, despite pleas from Manstein.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1825, Larkins, {{which had}} sailed from Calcutta for England, {{had to return}} as she was leaky. The {{expectation}} was that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into dock. After Larkins was {{pulled out of the}} dock and had taken on part of her cargo, it was discovered that she was still taking on water. She therefore was pulled back into the dock to be coppered and sheathed.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the County Championship, Lancashire {{assumed the}} {{ascendancy}} of Division Two with an eight-wicket win over Essex which also secured their return to Division One after only one season on the lowest rung of the Championship ladder. National League losses for Worcestershire Royals and Hampshire Hawks then left four teams on 22 points {{in the bottom of}} Division One – three of them <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down.|$|E
25|$|The Galleanists {{knew that}} Salsedo {{had been held}} by the Bureau and might have talked to authorities.

The Galleanist plotters realized that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> underground and dispose of any incriminating evidence. After their arrest, Sacco and Vanzetti {{were found to have}} correspondence with several Galleanists; one letter warned Sacco to destroy all mail after reading.|$|E

She was also invited to meet with Queen Elizabeth II at Marlborough House in London in March 2007.

50|$|His star faded {{somewhat}} {{after his}} conviction for extortion {{in connection with}} a cloakmakers' strike in 1891, in which he was accused of accepting a check for one hundred dollars from an employer who had violated his collective bargaining agreement with the union. The accusation was probably false; the union did not have its own checking account at the time, so any payment <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the account of an individual who did. After being convicted, Barondess jumped bail to flee to Canada, returning to serve a shortened sentence only after union leaders pleaded for him to do so.|$|R

25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed in 1893, the WFM shared the AFL's conservatism. But its experiences {{going up against}} Mine Owners' Associations and their allies convinced the WFM that acting in a non-threatening manner wasn't going to accomplish anything worthwhile. Many union members had begun to reconsider their conservative assumptions about confrontation and violence. By the late 1890s, the WFM believed that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> toe to toe with mine owners and other employers. The WFM even considered creating rifle clubs for carefully chosen members.|$|E
25|$|The di Marcos are now deemed as {{something}} of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really knew {{what to do with the}} di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E
25|$|After the verdict, New Democratic Party of Canada Member of Parliament Charlie Angus {{publicly}} {{called for}} Black's expulsion from the Queen's Privy Council for Canada {{and for his}} removal from the Order of Canada. The Toronto Star similarly called for then-Governor General Michaëlle Jean to remove Black from the Order. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that Black <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through regular channels to attempt to regain his Canadian citizenship, that membership in the Order of Canada is {{the purview of the}} Governor General and that decisions about the Privy Council would only take place after the legal process, including appeal, had been completed.|$|E

25|$|New York State Route32A (NY32A) is a {{state highway}} in the Hudson Valley region of New York in the United States. It serves as a {{connector}} between NY32 {{in the town of}} Saugerties and NY23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter. If NY32A did not exist, drivers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> several miles {{out of their way to}} the intersection of NY32 and NY23A.|$|E
25|$|Operation Accolade, {{called for}} a direct attack on Rhodes and Karpathos, with three {{infantry}} divisions, an armored brigade, and support units. Landings at Crete, which was too well fortified and had a strong German garrison, were dropped. The main problem faced by the planners was the difficulty of countering Fliegerkorps X of the Luftwaffe {{because of a lack}} of air cover, since the American and British aircraft were based in Cyprus and the Middle East. This challenge was further exacerbated by the demands of the upcoming Allied invasion of Sicily. The Americans were skeptical about the operation, which they regarded as aiming mostly at post-war political benefits for Britain and an unnecessary diversion from the Italian campaign. They refused to support it, warning the British that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on alone.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E
