500|$|NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at a 2007 {{press conference}} {{broadcast}} on CBC Sports, said, [...] "Fighting {{has always had}} a role in the game... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at just as <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at hits to the head. But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or {{should be part of the}} game." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} ideas Assis had for the film was to show the mons pubis of a {{waitress}} he knew. Though he was unsure how to include this element, the yellow-colored pubic hair matched the book Tempo Amarelo ("Yellow Time"), by sociologist Renato Carneiro Campos. The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the [...] "rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country". Assis {{wanted to create a}} film to show [...] "the face of the Brazilian people. We are from the Third World and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at ourselves".|$|E

Upon {{succeeding}} the party's leadership from Banyat, Abhisit noted, [...] "It {{will take a}} long time to revive the party because <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> four years ahead and consider how to stay in the hearts of the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Montgomery County District Attorney and Lower Merion detectives {{had also}} {{launched}} an investigation {{to see if}} any criminal laws were broken, including wiretap and privacy laws.

30|$|What {{lies behind}} this {{differentiated}} behavior of Greece and the SP group vis-à-vis the ROECD group? <b>To</b> answer this, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> first <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what determines {{the behavior of}} WPR and TSL in each group of the countries.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2009, it was {{reported}} that the D/L method would be reviewed for the Twenty20 format after its appropriateness was questioned in the quickest version of the game.

2500|$|PAUL: No, {{non-intervention}} {{was a major}} contributing factor. Have {{you ever}} read about the reasons they attacked us? They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for ten years. We've been in the Middle East [...] I think [...] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the Vatican. We're building 14 permanent bases. What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico? We would be objecting. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what we do, {{from the point of}} view of what it would be like if someone did it to us.|$|E
2500|$|Now for the ritorno. [...] The landmark, as noted, is WSW of {{the ship}}'s morning {{position}} (C). [...] So to [...] "return" [...] to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing {{from its current}} NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW. [...] However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of [...] "intended" [...] direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, so <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar. [...] Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 [...] 2.84 = 73.84. [...] And there we have it. [...] The landmark is 73.84 {{miles away from the}} ship's morning position.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{drafting}} process, Banjerd {{said in an}} interview: “I personally believe in social structure and administration through traditions and customs that we once had in small communities.

2500|$|On 11 June, Carpenter warned {{he might}} need to invoke {{emergency}} powers and take control of all of WA's gas and electricity supplies, which would result in rolling stoppages, blackouts and brownouts. He also said he had discussed accessing emergency diesel supplies stored by the Department of Defence at Garden Island with Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard. [...] The state's Energy Minister, Fran Logan, said the decommissioned Muja AB coal-fired power station at Collie would be returned to service to supply 25 terajoules to industry. He estimated it would take up to six weeks before the plant was operational, and said, [...] "These units are old and not as environmentally friendly as new generators. However, the state is facing a significant gas shortage and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at all avenues".|$|E
2500|$|Palin told RealClearPolitics on May 31, 2011, {{that she}} {{supports}} {{the elimination of}} all energy subsidies, such those for ethanol: [...] "I think that all of our energy subsidies need to be relooked at today and eliminated, and {{we need to make sure}} that we're investing and allowing our businesses to invest in reliable energy products right now that aren't going to necessitate subsidies because, bottom line, we can't afford it." [...] She continued, [...] "We've got to allow the free market to dictate what's most efficient and economical for our nation's economy. No, at this time, our country can't afford the subsidies. Before, though, we even start arguing about some of these domestic subsidies that need to be eliminated– should be– <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at ending subsidies and loans to foreign countries and their energy production that we're relying on, like Brazil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like {{we are in a}} place of competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which were implanted in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E
5000|$|When it all started, {{the architects}} {{came to me}} and asked what I had envisioned. Was I <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> have a retro stadium? Did we have that in mind?

I'd like to see us build a great, 'contemporary' building." ...|$|R
40|$|What {{this paper}} {{presents}} is {{the outline of a}} problem and a suggestion about where we might look for a solution. I will propose a set of properties of items which might loosely be called "appositional", indicate why these properties cause grief for all theories of syntax, and suggest that <b>we</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a possible escape route outside sentence grammar altogether, in the realm of discourse structure...|$|R
50|$|According to the paper, {{economic}} {{institutions are}} the determinant {{of the colonial}} success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources. At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions - especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated. To explain the different colonial cases, <b>we</b> thus <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions.|$|R

60|$|The Irish {{question}} {{at the present time}} occupies a vastly different position to what it did in the year 1886. Ever since 1880 the attention of Parliament has been devoted constantly to Ireland, and the attention of Parliament, when devoted constantly to one object, is rarely fruitless. The twenty-five years that have passed have seen great changes in Ireland. We have seen a great scheme of local government, which Lord Salisbury said would be more disastrous than Home Rule itself, actually put into force. We have seen the scheme of land purchase, which in the year 1886 did more to injure the Home Rule Bill than anything else, actually carried, not indeed to a complete conclusion, but carried into practical effect by a Unionist Administration. These are great events; and their consequences, I think, ought to encourage us to move forward, and not to move back. They have produced results in Ireland which are beneficent, and the Irish question no longer presents itself in the tragic guise of the early eighties. They have produced an effect on Great Britain too. All over our country people have seen Bills which they were told beforehand would be ruinous to the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom--Land Bills and Local Government Bills--passed into law; and so far from the dire consequences which were apprehended from these measures, they have found--you here have found--that great good has resulted from that legislation. Many people are encouraged by what has taken place to make a step forward in the future; and I think if <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for any further encouragement, we should find it in the great and undisputed triumph which, under the mercy of Heaven, has attended our policy in South Africa, and has resulted in bringing into the circle of the British Empire a strong and martial race, which might easily have been estranged for ever.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} long-standing {{problems}} {{in the analysis of}} Chinese, such as the question of word classes and grammatical relations, can be resolved, or actually done away with completely, if we take a constructionist approach in the analysis.
