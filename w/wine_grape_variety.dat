25|$|The grape shares some {{morphological}} similarities {{with the}} Savoy wine grape Altesse {{and has been}} historically confused with the French <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety.</b> In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Pošip. The Romanian wine grape Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian wine grape Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with the grape.|$|E
25|$|It was {{previously}} suggested that Mondeuse noire was {{identical to the}} northern Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso due to the similarity of the wines. In California, many plantings of Mondeuse noire were called Refosco, further adding to the confusion. DNA analysis has shown {{that this is not}} the case, and that the two varieties are unrelated. Mondeuse noire is very similar to Muscardin which is found in Southern Rhône where it is one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the wine Châteauneuf-du-Pape. One difference is that Muscardin has less sensitivity to downy mildew.|$|E
25|$|Early Italian wine writers {{speculated that}} Carignan, known as Carignano in several parts of Italy, was a Phoenician <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> {{that was brought}} to the island of Sardinia by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC. From there the grape is {{believed}} to have spread to other Phoenician colonies, including the settlement at Sulcis, eventually being brought to the Italian mainland and carried around the western Mediterranean basin by the ancient Romans. Today, ampelographers largely discount this theory {{due to the lack of}} historical documentation or evidence from DNA analysis suggesting a Phoenician or Italian origin. Instead, the evidence points more strongly to a Spanish origin of the grape.|$|E

25|$|Pinot gris, Pinot grigio or Grauburgunder {{is a white}} <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> of {{the species}} Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot noir variety, it {{normally}} has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot supposedly could {{have been given to}} it because the grapes grow in small pine cone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink, and {{it is one of the}} more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.|$|E
25|$|In Spain, Mourvèdre (where {{the grape}} {{is known as}} Monastrell) was the fourth most widely planted red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> {{at the turn of}} the 21st century with around 63,000 {{hectares}} (155,000 acres) in 2004. Like many other Spanish varieties, its numbers have been declining in recent years (in 1996 there was over 100,000 ha/250,000 of the vine planted in Spain) as growers pull up older plantings and replant them with popular international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. However, the variety still has a strong hold in eastern Spain where it is widely planted in several Spanish wine regions around Murcia and the Valencian Community. Under Spanish wine law, Monastrell is one of the primary red wine grape varieties in the DOs of Jumilla, Yecla, Valencia, Almansa and Alicante.|$|E
25|$|Douce noir (also {{known as}} Bonarda, Corbeau and Charbono) {{is a red}} Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> that has {{historically}} been grown in the Savoie wine region (which shifted from Italian to French control in 1860), but today is more widely planted in Argentina. The earliest mention of the grape dates from when Etruscans first planted Bonarda some 3.000 {{years ago in the}} Padana Region. It arrived in Savoie in the early 19th century, {{and by the end of}} the century it was the most widely grown red wine grape in the region. In the early 21st century it was discovered that the Bonarda grape, which is the 2nd most widely planted red grape, after Malbec, in Argentina was the Italian wine grape Bonarda Piemontese imported by Italian immigrants. The grape is also grown in California where it is known as Charbono.|$|E

25|$|Furmint {{is a white}} Hungarian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> that is most noted widely {{grown in}} the Tokaj-Hegyalja wine region where {{it is used to}} produce single-varietal dry wines as well as being the {{principal}} grape in the better known Tokaji dessert wines. It is also grown in the tiny Hungarian wine region of Somló. Furmint plays a similar role in the Slovakian wine region of Tokaj. It is also grown in Austria where it is known as Mosler. Smaller plantings are found in Slovenia where it is known as Šipon. The grape is also planted in Croatia where it is known as Moslavac. It is also found in Romania and in former republics of the Soviet Union. Furmint is a late ripening variety. For dry wines the harvest starts usually in September, however sweet wine specific harvest can start {{in the second half of}} October or even later, and is often inflicted with Botrytis.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to make {{everything}} from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E
25|$|Grenache {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{varieties}} to be introduced to Australia in the 18th century and eventually became the country's most widely planted red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>variety</b> until it was surpassed by Shiraz in the mid 1960s. Early Australian Grenache was a main component in the sweet fortified wines that was the lynchpin of the early Australian wine industry. In the 19th century, California wine growers prized the vine's ability to produce high yields and withstand heat and drought conditions. The grape was extensively planted throughout the hot San Joaquin Valley where it was mainly used as a blending component for pale, sweet jug wines. In the late 20th century, the Rhone Rangers movement brought attention to the production of premium varietal Grenache and Rhone style blends modeled after the Grenache dominate wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In the early 20th century, Grenache {{was one of the}} first Vitis vinifera grapes to be successfully vinified during the early development of the Washington wine industry with a 1966 Yakima Valley rosé earning mention in wine historian Leon Adams treatise The Wines of America.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} plantings of Brun Fourca have been {{confused}} with other <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> due to either similarities in appearance of synonyms.

40|$|Urla {{had been}} an {{important}} center of viticulture and wine making due to its suitable ecology for vineyards. It is also known {{that there are some}} <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> endemic to this area. However, for various reasons, the viticulture in Urla started to diminish {{in the beginning of the}} twentieth century, almost getting to the point of extinction in the mid-century. As the interest for <b>wines</b> and <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> rose in the 1990 s, vineyards have started to be rebuilt in this area. However, mostly foreign varieties are grown in these vineyards; the local cultivars are non-existent now, except for some small vineyards. Rebuilding of vineyards and wineries would be very valuable for both economic and touristic development of Urla. Detecting and registering local grape cultivars and producing high-quality chateau <b>wines</b> from these <b>grapes</b> would create a greater added value. Five grapevines that might represent different red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> have been found in Urla. Although these vines might represent historical local grape cultivars, they might also be some examples of <b>grape</b> <b>varieties</b> that are already known. In this study the vines that were found in Urla were compared to the black grape cultivars collected from the Aegean Region, and to the major Turkish and the world red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties,</b> using molecular methods. For the molecular analyses, SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) markers were utilized first. 14 grapevine varieties that show close relationship to the vines found in Urla were further analyzed with AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) markers. UPGMA graph and genetic similarity coefficient values of the AFLP analysis indicated that Urla karası 4 and Urla karası 5 belong to grapevine accessions certainly different from the analyzed samples. However, in order to determine whether or not the vines found in Urla represent economically valuable novel red <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> <b>varieties,</b> these should be further propagated and their wine qualitys were analysed...|$|R
