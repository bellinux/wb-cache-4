5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

25|$|International {{isolation}} was keenly {{felt by the}} South African team at the time, including Pollock, and {{the players}} took measures to try to reverse the looming sporting boycott. In 1971, Pollock {{took part in a}} protest organised by Barry Richards and Mike Procter against the South African government's apartheid policy as it referred to cricket. During a match to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Republic of South Africa, the players from both teams walked off after one ball, issuing a joint statement: We cricketers feel {{that the time has come}} for an expression of our views. <b>We</b> <b>fully</b> support the South African Cricket Association's application to invite non-whites to tour Australia, if they are good enough, and further subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.|$|E
500|$|While on the {{disabled}} list, Galvis tested positive for having a metabolite of Clostebol (a performance-enhancing a synthetic steroid) in his system, a violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Galvis denied any wrongdoing, commenting, [...] "I cannot understand how even this tiny particle of a banned substance got into my body. I have not and never would knowingly use anything illegal to enhance my performance." [...] He was suspended 50 games by Major League Baseball for testing positive for a banned substance. Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. said [...] "It's disappointing. <b>We</b> <b>fully</b> support {{the program and the}} decision. At the same time, we support the player."

They are making fairy pictures for young people. <b>We</b> <b>fully</b> expect to see other makers follow suit, when they realize what the real Christmas sentiment is, namely one of lightness, brightness, joyousness." [...] Advertisements for the productions show the great desire of the company to produce the three films in the December 1910 season, but interest in the Christmas and New Year's productions would have waned by mid-January 1911 with the productions still not released. Ultimately, the Gnome Motion Picture Company represents an early attempt to cater film productions to children and during the Christmas season.|$|E

For five months, the trio stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, {{where they would}} often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how {{we were supposed to}} behave as Green Day. For the first time, <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, at a cost of $650,000.

500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But I must say I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{future of}} captain Jarome Iginla was also questioned. [...] He has one season {{remaining}} {{on his contract}} with the team, and with the future direction of the team in doubt, even he questioned whether he would be with the team in 2012–13: [...] "I really don't know what next year holds. [...] I don't know the direction (of the team). Do I wanna rebuild? [...] Do I wanna be on a team if <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> rebuild? [...] I don't know that I do."

2500|$|In Tikkun {{magazine}} Jordi Pigem opined, In {{the last}} ten years, landmark works...have been reflecting and kindling a growing awareness that nature {{is not merely a}} sum of molecules obeying physical and chemical laws, but a living, sensuous, and ensouled matrix in which <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> participate and belong. Tarnas' Cosmos and Psyche extends this rising awareness beyond the bounds of the biosphere. Our psyche is not only deeply connected with our immediate natural environment, but with the whole of the cosmos encompassing us, with the rhythms of the planets we can see above us on clear nights. Searching beneath the depths of the psyche, Tarnas has found the heights of the cosmos. Cosmos and Psyche may radically transform the way we see cultural and political history, individual life journeys, and our sense of participation in the universe. Daniel Pinchbeck, writing in Reality Sandwich, opined that Cosmos was [...] "scrupulously researched and carefully argued", and that it advances [...] "a radical thesis...which seeks to revive astrology as a serious intellectual discipline and provide a cosmological missing link between the human world and the greater universe in which we are embedded." [...] Pinchbeck writes that Cosmos may offer [...] "a transformative matrix for reconceiving our relationship to the cosmos." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} attacks on Dryden's {{reputation}} was by Wordsworth, who complained that Dryden's descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden's works), were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous [...] "Intimations of Immortality" [...] ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's [...] "Alexander's Feast". John Keats admired the [...] "Fables", and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as [...] "classics of our prose." [...] He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to {{take an interest in}} Dryden was T. S. Eliot, who wrote that he was [...] "the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century", and that [...] "we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless <b>we</b> <b>fully</b> enjoy Dryden." [...] However, in the same essay, Eliot accused Dryden of having a [...] "commonplace mind". [...] Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently, but, as a relatively straightforward writer (William Empson, another modern admirer of Dryden, compared his [...] "flat" [...] use of language with Donne's interest in the [...] "echoes and recesses of words"), his work has not occasioned as much interest as Andrew Marvell's, John Donne's or Pope's.|$|E
