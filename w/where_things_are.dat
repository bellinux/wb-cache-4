25|$|Within ASL {{there is}} a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. These verbs include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either {{physically}} present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, direct or indirect depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and moves toward the locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed {{at each other and}} alkuately approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify <b>where</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> or how they moved them around.|$|E
500|$|Martin E. Cirulis of Computer Gaming World {{wrote that}} Command & Conquer [...] "remains mainly a good, networkable version of Dune II". Cirulis found the game's {{interface}} intuitive and described its online component as [...] "sophisticated and easy-to-use", also praising its story for being [...] "as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire", and commented that he [...] "would buy C {{just to see}} <b>where</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going to end up". However, according to him, the developers failed [...] "to correct major shortcomings" [...] in Dune II, as its fog of war does not fit with the real-world setting, also finding fault with design choices in the game's missions, which he believed were structured like [...] "puzzles" [...] that allowed for {{only one way to}} win. Nevertheless, he concluded that it remained [...] "the best-looking and sounding strategy game yet" [...] despite its flaws, and that it was [...] "more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game [...] "has all the playability of Dune II, but with more diverse units, more unusual scenarios, and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes." [...] McDonald called its combat a [...] "satisfying blend of action and strategy", and noted that this, combined with an attention to [...] "little details", made the game a [...] "success", also praising its cutscenes as [...] "terrifically executed". Although he was disappointed that the game lacked [...] "fancier terrain or another zoom level", McDonald concluded: [...] "This game is a whole lot of fun, so get it, play it, and love it like your own child." ...|$|E

[...] He also stated that [...] "As was true almost {{everywhere}} else, idealogical gulfs often divided families. This is the terrain into which Lee has ventured, and the resulting motion picture offers yet another effective and affecting portrait of the United States' most important and difficult conflict." [...] In consummate verbiage, David Sterritt writing for The Christian Science Monitor reasoned, [...] "The movie is longer and slower than necessary, but it explores interesting questions of wartime violence, personal integrity, {{and what it means}} to come of age in a society ripping apart at the seams." [...] Film critic Steve Simels of TV Guide was consumed with the nature of the subject matter exclaiming, [...] "A nicely ambiguous ending and terrific acting by the mostly young cast mostly makes up for the longeurs, however, and for the record, Jewel acquits herself well in a not particularly demanding role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know <b>where</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E

The {{premise is that}} due to statistics like the Australian gaming industry profiting over $1 billion and in profit and 95% of Australian youth calling themselves gamers, [...] "the chances are that someone close to you cares a bit about videogames and also knows a bit about...Good Game".

Just like the show, it features descriptions of games which should be played, history about game development in Australia and other general video game related discussions. It was co-written by hosts Steven O'Donnell and Jeremy Ray and show producers Janet Carr and Maurice Branscombe, and was published by ABC Books. Girl.com.au described the book as a [...] "fantastic guide" [...] and [...] "brilliantly packaged", and added it is [...] "not only a great insight into the gaming world, but also helpful for those in the know and those just getting a taste for gaming".|$|E

And it’s the subtle touches, no less than the sweeping ones, that leave an impression." [...] The Boston Globe also gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala are the creative duo driving the band and once again deliver on a standing promise to blow any mind that is willing to stay open." [...] Planet Sound gave it {{a score of}} seven out of ten and called it the band's [...] "most chilled-out and approachable record." [...] NME also gave it a score of seven out of ten and said it [...] "might be their ‘reflective’ effort, but it’s classic MV." [...] Under the Radar gave it seven stars out of ten and said, [...] "We already knew The Mars Volta could shred. Now we know they can slow the pace too and be equally as compelling." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it [...] "isn’t a representation of the best The Mars Volta are capable of, but it is a glimpse into the power they possess when they better harness their capabilities." [...] musicOMH also gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said {{that for the first time}} the band [...] "really can do restraint, without compromising the overall impact of the instances <b>where</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> let rip."
