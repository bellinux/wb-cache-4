The administrators had {{numerous}} opportunities {{to reach a}} compromise but displayed {{little interest in the}} welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E

500|$|While {{critical}} reviews were mixed, {{the game}} proved popular with players. The game's alpha footage, {{as well as}} Let's Play videos on pre-release copies such as that from PewDiePie, drew {{a great deal of}} demand for the game prior to release. Ibrisagic stated that Coffee Stain Studios made their money back on the development costs within a few minutes of the game being offered on Steam. As of August 2014, the studio has reported that nearly a million copies of Goat Simulator have been sold, outperforming their other games over the previous four years. The mobile release for iOS and Android systems reached 100,000 downloads within 6 days of launch. By mid-January 2015, over 2.5 million copies of the game were sold across all platforms. During a presentation at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Ibrisagic revealed that Goat Simulator has made more than $12 million in revenue, compared to both Sanctum and Sanctum 2 which made under $2 million each. Goat Simulator was seen as a disruptive title in contrast to typical AAA titles; Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester felt they needed to publish more games like Goat Simulator, stating [...] "You have to have an edge in there, and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> 'more Goat Simulator and less Call of Duty' for Paradox, because we need the edge. It's easier to get out and market, it's easier to show what you're doing" [...] adding that [...] "People are tired of explosions and dubstep music. We've seen it a million times now".|$|E

My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor.

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1965 election, he very briefly served as {{parliamentary}} secretary (junior minister) to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1965, {{but the two}} fell out when Chrétien advised him against seeking an election in 1965, predicating (correctly) that Pearson would not win the majority he was seeking. When Pearson recruited his [...] "Three Wise Men" [...] consisting of Jean Marchand, Gérard Pelletier and Pierre Trudeau into the cabinet, Chrétien was offended at {{the way he was}} by-passed, telling Pearson he deserved to be promoted to the cabinet. Starting in 1966 served for a more substantial period of time as the parliamentary secretary to Minister of Finance, Mitchell Sharp. Sharp was to serve as Chrétien's mentor and patron, and it was largely through Sharp's influence that Chrétien rose up the ranks. Like his mentor Sharp, Chrétien was identified with {{the right wing of the}} Liberal Party in the 1960s, and it was not until the 1970s that Chrétien first started to become identified with the left-wing of the Liberals. Sharp was quoted as saying about his protégé in an interview with Peter C. Newman: Jean is not accustomed to reading as much as I am or you are, and therefore we tend to judge him on that sort of basis. We read all sorts of things; Chrétien doesn't. Chrétien's reading is limited. He has an instinctive approach, and faced with a problem, he's always comes out with sensible answers, and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> he never has to eat his words. In 1967, Chrétien visited western Canada for the first time, which he was curious to see. In Vancouver he declared in a speech about the demands for more powers for Quebec being made by Union Nationale Premier Daniel Johnson that [...] "whose who are in favor of a special status [...] are often separatists who don't want to admit they are separatists", which caused an uproar in la belle province with Johnson saying he just wanted more powers for Quebec, not independence. When the French President Charles de Gaulle in a speech during his visit to Montreal said [...] "vive le Québec libre!" [...] ("Long Live A Free Quebec!") and compared English-Canadians to the Nazis, Chrétien in a cabinet meeting demanded that Pearson have de Gaulle formally declared persona non grata and expelled, instead of politely asking him to leave Canada, which was the course that Pearson followed.|$|E
