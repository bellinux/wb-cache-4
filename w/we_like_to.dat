In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".

500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> keep it that way until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, it was {{announced}} that Aguilera was teaming up with Swedish hit producer Max Martin on her comeback single for her then upcoming album. On July 3, 2012, Billboard reported that the [...] "club banger" [...] would be officially produced by Martin. Writing for the same publication, Andrew Hampp thought that their collaboration was very [...] "surprising" [...] because Martin had been working with a lot of artists, including the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears; however, [...] "Your Body" [...] was the first song Martin wrote for Aguilera, as Aguilera had previously wanted to differentiate herself from the aforementioned acts. During an interview with the magazine, she commented on the Swedish producer, saying [...] "Max is legendary in the business. He's known about me but we haven't crossed paths... It's taken us a decade in the same business and watching each other from a distance, so for us to now come together and respect each other's work ethic and how <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be heard and making a marriage out of it, I think [...] "Your Body" [...] is the best culmination of that".|$|E
500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album.

[...] <b>We</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have fun onstage and in our lives, so we didn't want this album to be as dark as the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if we learn from our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it will make us a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's love and mercy is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E
