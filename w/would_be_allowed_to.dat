In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{major issue}} during Panetta's tenure as Defense Secretary was the Obama administration's {{diplomatic}} effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In January 2012, Panetta stated that nuclear weapons development was a [...] "red line" [...] that Iran <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> cross {{and that the}} United States was keeping all options, including military ones, open to prevent it.

2500|$|Tucker {{proposed}} the gradual emancipation of slaves, {{a process that}} other states, such as New York, {{began in the late}} eighteenth century, when some northern states abolished slavery altogether. Tucker's plan began with the manumission of all women born to slaves after the plan took effect; all the women's descendants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> born free. After being freed under the plan, women born to slaves <b>would</b> <b>be</b> obligated to serve their former master's family until the age of 28, after which time they would receive $20, some clothes, and two blankets. At least the first generation of the freed women's descendants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "bound to service by the overseers of the poor" [...] until age 21. Black people in Virginia <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> hold public office, nor could they own land; they <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> lease land for terms of up to 21 years. They <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> own or bear arms, except when specifically permitted by the General Assembly (and even then, Assembly authorization could only last for a three-year term). Black people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forbidden from marrying a person outside of their race, and they could not serve as an attorney or as a juror; they <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> serve as a witness against other black people in court. In addition, black people <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> create a will; serve as a trustee, administrator, or executor; or have property held in trust for them.|$|R

5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and {{outlying}} region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Zurich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, {{just two}} days after {{entering}} the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the officials <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> stay at their post.

Members of Congress <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> serve as government ministers, and the State Council <b>would</b> <b>be</b> abolished.

5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs {{have changed since}} the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth man <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> take to {{the field in the}} place of one of the players and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a full cap. These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E

However, it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and nothing came of the plans.|$|E
5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> see them.

Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni took back the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E
