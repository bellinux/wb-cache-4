5|$|The club crest, {{which was}} used for many years until 2010 when the club exited administration, {{was based on the}} {{achievement}} of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the Latin motto Animo et Fide, which loosely translated, means <b>With</b> <b>Courage</b> and Faith. The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name. The twin-towered castle above the shield is Stockport Castle, which stood until 1775.|$|E

25|$|The Testament of Judah is {{primarily}} concerned <b>with</b> <b>courage,</b> monetary greed, and fornication.

At first, the country was subject to anarchy and pillage, foreign enemies occupied all the forts, and robber chiefs were masters of the rural areas and carried on their brigandage there with impunity.|$|E

25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled <b>with</b> <b>courage</b> and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the stories {{involved}} in these puppet plays comes from the kingdoms of eastern Java: Jenggala, Kediri and Majapahit.
