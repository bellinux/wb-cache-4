These tools are complex, expensive, they facilities often depends on the vendor and usually they arent compatible each other. If we put in practice the new concepts developed in the OS Plan 9 we can access to network devices as if they were files and folders. The OS has been built {{in a way that it}} is allowed. This gives the chance to applications to be independent from network protocols and allow the management and maintenance of network devices straight from OS tools. It also allows programming in the language the user desire, included scripting languages, and get information of network devices remotely from a mobile phone or a <b>web</b> <b>navigator.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic <b>Web</b> <b>Navigator</b> (AWN) is a {{prototype}} of an application for web browsing where structural, graphical, and text elements of web pages appear as a sound map under user’s mouse pointer or tab/arrow keys. It could serve as accessibility tool, as an interface for devices with limited visualization capabilities, for telerobotics, for sonic iconography, for development of other auditory-object interfaces and managers. AWN differs from existing browsers for the blind like WebbIE, WeMedia browser, Homer and other webpage readers, which mainly have verbal interfaces speaking only text to the user. This paper formulates the main directions of the research and proposes an AWN model to be developed as research evaluation. Requirements for the research and evaluation model are combined with various approaches to the problems of: web browser adaptations, accessibility, multimodal interfaces, image recognition, sound objects, sound browsing, immersive sonic environments, aural representation of spatial objects and their recognition.

In this paper, we propose a set of tools to define virtual humans and bring them to life by using a standard 3 D language for the WEB. 1 Introduction Until 1995, information on the WEB was exclusively in two dimensions, using hypertext to organise WEB pages. By {{the emergence of a new}} standard language known as Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), it becomes possible to define a three dimensional world that everybody can examine on the WEB, by using the same navigator as before.

Counterpart, digital medical imaging (MIs) management became a critical task. In this work, we present a prototype, based on the worldwide web (www) technologies, which perform this function. It contemplates a MIs server which allows the research and the recovering of these images stored in digital imaging files and communications in medicine (Dicom), besides receiving service requests of equipment without compatible application with this pattern. The MIs can be viewed and manipulated inside a <b>web</b> <b>navigator</b> (applications customer) by means of a Java (applet) application. Such approach offers some advantages related to the traditional archiving systems and images communication (picture archiving and communication systems [Pacs]), among then the independence of platforms, installation and maintenance facilities, data distribution and the integration with other systems, inside or outside the institution. Its enough to use the implementation of security policies.

40|$|The {{wireless}} {{data transmission}} between devices {{is becoming an}} extended option. There are many areas where we can find sensor nodes monitoring in a continuous mode some physical magnitude. In medical and hospital environments, for example, {{it is common to}} see patients connected to computers that are used for monitoring their physiological parameters. In these cases, it would be much more comfortable to have a wireless transmission system that would allow us to remove connections between the patient and the measuring instruments. The aim of this work is to give a solution to this need. It is proposed to design and to build a wireless transmission system in order to remove the wires of a data acquisition system. A general solution has been sought, but our proposal is specific solution to monitoring situations of physiological parameters or other similar features. To verify that we have reached the objectives set, the most complete solution that we have proposed {{has been used as a}} transmission over an IP electrocardiography signal that comes from the seat of a wheelchair.

40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} part II of {{the contribution}} {{to the analysis of}} web visit histories through a new methodological framework for web usage-structure mining considering association rules theory. The aim is to explore through a tree structure the sequence of direct rules (i. e. paths) that characterize a <b>web</b> <b>navigator</b> who keeps standing longer on a web page with respect to the path characterizing navigators who leave the web earlier. A novel tree-based structure is introduced to take into account that the learning sample changes click by click leaving out navigators who drop off from the web after any click. The response variable at each time point is the remaining number of clicks before leaving the web. The split is induced by the predictors that describe the preferred web sections. The methodology introduced results in a Nested Stump Regression Tree that is an hierarchy of stump trees, where a stump is a tree with only one split or, equivalently, with only two terminal nodes. Suitable properties are outlined. As in first part of the {{contribution to the}} analysis of the web visit histories, a methodological description is provided by considering a web portal with a fixed set of web sections, i. e. a data set coming from the UCI Machine Learning Repository...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, Internet is {{the main}} source of {{information}} for millions of people and enterprises. However, the information in Internet has not been classified yet and, consequently, the search for information {{is one of the most}} important tasks and processes performed by users and systems. In particular, for WWW human users the search for information {{is the main}} (time-consuming) task performed. In order to face this problem both the industrial and the academic communities have developed many methods and tools to index and search web pages. The most extended solution is the use of search engines such as Google and Y ahoo; however, while current search engines can be a suitable solution to find a particular webpage, they are useless to find the relevant information in such a page. Hence, once a webpage is found, the user must search on it in order to verify if the information needed is in there. This is a problem which until now has not been satisfactorily solved. In this paper we present a tool able to automatically extract from a webpage the information (text, images, etc.) related to a filtering criterion without the use of semantic specifications or indexes and without the need of offline parsing or compilation processes. This tool has been published as an extension for the Firefox’s <b>web</b> <b>navigator...</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{internet}} {{has been a major}} source of information. Blind or visually impaired people have limited access to {{the internet}}; they may use screen readers, screen magnifiers, refreshable Braille displays or Braille printers. The level of user convenience provided by each tool is different and Braille display is found to be the most popular tool. Other tools have certain limitations on the speed of access and interaction. This paper presents a low cost novel tactile <b>web</b> <b>navigator</b> device aimed at enabling blind people to have feasible internet accessibility. This navigator design includes a microcontroller that communicates with the browser software running on the PC to acquire the text from a web page. The text is subsequently displayed using an array of solenoids which gives the required tactile sense. The blind user then uses his/her tactile sense to recognize the text in Braille language. It is recognized that {{only a small percentage of}} blind people are familiar Braille, another mode for output was developed which uses the English characters. The English characters may also appear in their conventional shapes to be sensed by the blind user. Many navigation functions like loading a webpage address, clicking on links and entering data (E-mails, passwords, etc) have been provided. The cost of the implementation is ~ 12 % of the commercial Braille displays. The navigator was tested with volunteer blind users and the results were good; they were able to read Braille characters. Recording their notes, some limitations were discovered and will be eliminated in future models...|$|E

All the connections are established by secure-internet thanks to a standard <b>web</b> <b>navigator.</b> An integrated e-mail system allows to improve patient-doctor communication. A total of 94 patients studied during a 3 -years period. During the study, a total of 3. 650 messages were sent and processed. 90 % of them where patient-doctor messages, and 10 % were doctor-doctor messages. The mean delay for response to a patient was 26 hours and to a doctor 22 hours. The hydration status of the PD patients was improved: during the study the mean weight decreased from 66 to 65 Kg and the mean blood pressure decreased from 10 to 9 mmHg. Previously to the study, the mean hospitalization rate of the PD patients was 19 days/year/patient. It showed a dramatic improvement to 10 days/year/patient during the study. The causes of hospitalizations were 60 % not PD related, and only 5 % due to hydration disorders. The large use of telemedicine with PD (DIATELIC) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the global hospitalization rate (and then the global cost of the therapy) and improves the PD patient's follow-up. For users (patients and doctors) it appears now to be as indispensable as the phone...|$|E

40|$|Tag {{clouds are}} a popular method for {{visualizing}} and linking socially-organized information on websites. Tag clouds represent {{variables of interest}} (such as popularity) in the visual appearance of the keywords themselves - using text properties such as font size, weight, or colour. Although tag clouds are becoming common, there is still little information about which visual features of tags draw the attention of viewers. As tag clouds attempt to represent {{a wider range of}} variables with a wider range of visual properties, it becomes difficult to predict what will appear visually important to a viewer. To investigate this issue, we carried out an exploratory study that asked users to select tags from clouds that manipulated nine visual properties. Our results show that font size and font weight have stronger effects than intensity, number of characters, or tag area; but when several visual properties are manipulated at once, there is no one property that stands out above the others. This study adds to the understanding of how visual properties of text capture the attention of users, indicates general guidelines for designers of tag clouds, and provides a study paradigm and starting points for future studies. In addition, our findings may be applied more generally to the visual presentation of textual hyperlinks as a way to provide more information to <b>web</b> <b>navigators...</b>|$|R

PIC 18 F 4520 In the rapid {{development}} of flexible automation and the broad application of computer technology, industrial monitor software has played an integral role {{in all kinds of}} industrial areas. It allows operators to monitor and control a plant in real-time with feedback from any number of processes. Traditionally industrial monitor software exhibits low efficiency, lack of reliability, non-reconfigurable and does not support multi-communication protocols, as is required for the exchange of data from outside of the factory. (Fan, 2006) Configuration software is basically type of the industrial automation and process monitor and control application. It supports Human Machine Interface (HMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, realizes interlink between low level device and upper management network. Nowadays, with the advent of Configuration Software, engineers can readily construct field control systems with minimal developmental time and cost while allowing the combination of a plethora of user requests and control.
