50|$|As {{the most}} famous {{contemporary}} historian {{of the story of}} the city of Trapani, Francesco Pugnatore, does not mention the existence of the Misteri in its magnum opus, the much detailed 'Historia di Trapani' published in 1594, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>presume</b> that the procession of the Misteri was not held before at least {{the latter part of the}} 16th century. As the Fellowship of the Precious Blood of Christ and of the Mysteries (in Latin Societas Pretiosissimi Sanguinis Christi et Misteriorum), one of the two religious societies which were managing the procession of the Misteri in the early to middle 17th century, was founded by in 1603, and the procession is explicitly referred on a document notarized the 20 April 1612, the deed of trust on which the Guild of the Journeymen was granted the caretaking of the group representing the Ascent to Calvary, we can also reasonably assume that the procession of the Misteri was surely held before the Easter of 1612.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the high-energy neutral atom (HENA) imager onboard the IMAGE satellite, we {{examined}} {{the relation between the}} SYM-H index and the ring current energy during a storm main phase. The energy range of the energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux data used here is 16 – 120 keV for hydrogen and < 180 keV for oxygen. From the data for the period 2000 – 2002, we selected 24 storm main phase events during which the IMAGE satellite was located at a geomagnetic latitude of ≥ 45 ° and a geocentric distance of ≥ 6 RE. According to the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke (DPS) equation, the ring current energy is expected to increase as the SYM-H index decreases. When the ENA energy flux is superimposed {{as a function of the}} SYM-H index for all 24 events, their overall correlation is negative; that is, the relation between the ENA energy flux and the SYM-H index is generally consistent with the DPS equation. However, an analysis of individual events showed only 10 events (42 %) in which the ENA energy flux was negatively correlated with the SYM-H index (negative correlation events). There were 10 events showing no clear correlation between the ENA energy flux and the SYM-H index (no correlation events) and 4 events which contradicted the DPS equation (positive correlation events). In the superimposed plot, we noted that a smooth curve can be drawn for an upper limit of the data distribution, and {{data from the}} no correlation or positive correlation events create downward branches in the distribution. These observational results are not explained by the conventional DPS equation but by the "generalized" DPS equation, which includes a term representing energy stored in the stretched magnetic field. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>presume</b> that the stretched magnetic field prevents energetic particles from being injected into the ring current. From the generalized DPS equation, we conclude that the total (kinetic and magnetic) energy stored in the stretched field and ring current loss mechanisms are important for understanding the relation between the ground magnetic field variation and ring current energy variation...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aetiology}} of perinatal arterial {{ischemic stroke}} remains speculative. It is however widely accepted that the aetiology is multifactorial, involving various maternal, placental, foetal and neonatal risk factors. A resulting thromboembolic process is hypothesized and the placenta {{identified as the}} most plausible source. An arteriopathy, as observed in {{a significant proportion of}} childhood ischemic stroke, is thought to be rare. METHODS: We report here five cases of perinatal stroke that differ from the vast majority by documented carotid occlusion, and add eleven other similar cases from the literature. RESULTS: In the majority, an intraluminal thrombus of placental origin is the most probable hypothesis, while in the remaining ones, one <b>can</b> <b>reasonably</b> <b>presume</b> a direct vessel wall injury related to a traumatic delivery, yet generally unproven by imaging. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that most of these cases share similar pathophysiology with the more common perinatal arterial ischemic stroke but differ by a persistent identified thrombus in the carotid artery at the time of first imaging, leading to a more severe and extended ischemic damage responsible for an adverse neurological outcome...|$|R
