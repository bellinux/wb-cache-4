5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The <b>western</b> <b>flower</b> <b>thrips,</b> Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flower</b> <b>thrips</b> {{are some}} of the most {{important}} pests of early-season blueberries. In 1998, 40 % of the losses in blueberry production in Georgia were attributed to <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> (USDA 1999). Thrips damage blueberries by oviposition and feeding. Females lay their eggs inside the ovary of the flowers and as the larvae emerge, they leave scars on the ovaries. Mobile stages feed on the flower damaging the cells of superficial layers. This damage is magnified when the ovaries increase their size to form fruits. Scars become more evident during fruit formation, therefore diminishing fruit quality. Under extremely high thrips pressure, the damage to the flowers is so severe that flower abortion may occur (Arèvalo-Rodriguez 2006). We have identified six species of <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> that were collected in early-season blueberries in Florida and southern Georgia during th...|$|R

40|$|Soybean vein {{necrosis}} virus (SVNV) is {{an emerging}} viral disease affecting soybean, first discovered in Tennessee in 2008. SVNV {{has been identified}} as being a new virus in the genus Tospovirus, which are typically vectored by thrips. So far, only soybean thrips have been confirmed to transmit SVNV. However, other thrips species are found in soybean fields, including eastern <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> and tobacco thrips. The objectives of this study were to 1) Determine vector competence in three thrips species including soybean, eastern <b>flower</b> and tobacco <b>thrips,</b> and 2) Determine the effect of SVNV on host plant preference and life history of the thrips vector. Vector competence assays showed that eastern <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> and tobacco thrips were able to acquire the virus after being exposed to SVNV-infected leaf tissues for 48 hours. Both species were also able to successfully transmit SVNV to healthy plants, but at a lower efficiency (less than 10 % of the plants were infected by eastern <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> and 36 % by tobacco thrips) than soybean thrips (71 % infection). SVNV infection did not influence host preference of soybean thrips that is both SVNV-infected and SVNV-uninfected soybean thrips aggregated on healthy plants compared to SVNV-infected plants. SVNV-infected soybean thrips had significantly higher fecundity compared to uninfected thrips.

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this thesis}} is to investigate the behaviour and ecology of the legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom and develop alternative control method. Its specific goals are to: (1) assess pest problems and management methods practiced by grain legume producers, and identifying the cropping systems in the study areas in Kenya; (2) study the impact of climate change on the geographic distribution of legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> on cowpea growing regions of Sub Saharn African countries; (3) study the behavior and survivorship of the legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> to develop an alternative control techniques using different essential oils and their derivative compounds. In most cases, development of alternative pest management strategy poorly considers to assess the indigenous knowledge and the perception on pest management practice. All of that can give ideas to be studied, adapted and eventually served as the building blocks in IPM programmes. In order to estimate the status of grain legume pest management practice, a field survey was conducted through household interviews based on a semi-structured questionnaire in eastern Kenya districts in highly representative areas of the main grain legume producing zone. The main results were the following ones: farmers {{were able to identify}} key pests of grain legumes using pictorial guide namely the legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> Megalurothrips sjostedti, the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora and the legume pod borer Maruca vitrata. In addition to that, the application of chemicals is the main control method practiced with an increasing concentration, chemical alternation, frequent application and mixing of chemicals to ensure pesticide effectiveness. This is an indicator of resistance development and less efficient way of managing pests. In addition, farmers mentioned the erratic rain as the main challenge together with damage caused by pests. These findings help filling the gap in the literature related to grain legume farmer's knowledge on pest management and its practice. This can be a base line for developing alternative control strategy which can be helpful for an easy adaptation of newly developed strategies to the farming system and other realities. Since climate change {{is also one of the}} main problems mentioned by 93 % of the respondents, an investigation on climate change effect on the geographic distribution of the legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom and its host crop in Africa has been conducted using 166 presence records of Megalurothrips sjostedti and 350 presence records of cowpea in order to model the climate change effects. MAXENT (Maximum entropy) modelling tool is used to predict the effects of climate change for the year 2055. AFRICLIM, a highresolution (up to 1 km) climate variable was used for projecting current and future potential distribution of this pest and its host in Africa. Rainfall and temperature are the influential environmental variables identified by a “jackknife” analysis. A study of the behavior and survivorship of legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> M. sjostedti was carried out with the intention of developing an alternative thrips controlling strategy; this study on the repellent effect of 24 plant extracts against legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> M. sjostedti was conducted using a visual cue-still air olfactometer in a fume hood. The results revealed that, among the tested 24 plant extracts, 7 showed a good repellency against M. sjostedti. The analysis based on this identification of the constituent compounds of the best repellent extracts was done using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectro photometer (GC-MS). Mono- and sesqui terpene hydrocarbon compounds from seven highly repellent extracts were identified. This has led to an investigation of the behavioural effects of the identified compounds on the second instars larvae and the adult female M. sjostedti. It has been studied the repellent, toxic and deterrent effect of 16 identified compounds against the adult female legume <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> M. sjostedti using different bioassay methodologies. The result revealed that the use of repellent extracts could be one of the useful in developing integrated pest management strategies for thrips on legume crops. In addition, the study of specific mode of actions of the identified compounds indicates that the tested compounds are not efficient as alternatives for insecticide application. Thus plant compounds could be used as a safe method of control in integrated pest management for the control of M. sjostedti and Thripidae family in combination with the current pest management strategies for grain legumes in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the plant extracts and our results may be exploited by extending behavioural manipulation to plant compounds released by companion plants through volatile collection and test under laboratory and field condition.
