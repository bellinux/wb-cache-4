500|$|Tom Burnett {{made several}} {{phone calls to}} his wife {{beginning}} at 09:30:32 from rows24 and 25, though he was assigned a seat in rowfour. Burnett explained that the plane had been hijacked by men claiming to have a bomb. He also said that a passenger had been stabbed with a knife and that he believed the bomb threat was a ruse to control the passengers. During one of Tom Burnett's calls, his wife informed him of {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Center and he replied that the hijackers were [...] "talking about crashing this plane.... Oh my God. It's a suicide mission." [...] He began pumping her for information about the attacks, interrupting her {{from time to time to}} tell the others nearby <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Then he hung up. He ended his last call by saying, [...] "Don't worry, we're going to do something." [...] An unknown flight attendant attempted to contact the United Airlines maintenance facility at 09:32:29. The call lasted 95 seconds, but was not received as it may have been in queue. Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called the maintenance facility at 09:35:40 from row33. She reported the flight had been hijacked by men with knives who were in the cabin and flight deck and had stabbed another flight attendant, possibly Debbie Welsh.|$|E
2500|$|Task Review: Velocity {{decided to}} go for a {{contemporary}} calendar featuring kitten photos despite numerous protests from Jo. However, their pitches were not helped by Nargis, who lost track of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> even snapping at the buyers, and the calendar received criticism for being irrelevant to the charity and for having the dates printed too small to make usable. Despite these issues, all three retailers made orders. Meanwhile, Invicta decided on a calendar featuring [...] "fun" [...] photos of children dressed up in various costumes. While the calendar's design was criticised, and Mani's early pitches were extremely poor, the team received a large order from one retailer that effectively earned them victory.|$|E
2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been coming over to visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother is}} not in a state to think one way or the other, Ned; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in such a state of grief that <b>she</b> hardly knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> or doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter, old chap?" [...] inquired Ukridge affectionately, {{glancing up}} from his pile of bills and forgetting his own {{troubles}} in an instant. [...] "Buck up! Aunt Elizabeth been getting on your nerves again? <b>What's</b> <b>she</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> this time?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The skit takes {{lines from}} Act 1 scenes 5 and 7 of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Lady Macbeth {{typically}} retains Shakespeare's lines, while Macbeth speaks in modern colloquial English, often expressing confusion about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> In Shaw's version, Macbeth {{is transformed into}} a [...] "maundering nincompoop".|$|R
60|$|Then, Clavering, {{who could}} not hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> flicked the horses and the sleigh slid away into the darkness.|$|E
60|$|He shuddered violently as she spoke, {{and motioned}} {{to her with}} his hand not {{to go on with}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Saunders gave Miss Northwick a wink of {{pity for}} Mrs. Newton and {{expressed}} {{that she was}} hardly accountable for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
50|$|Night and Day {{throws up}} themes of colonization, journalism, language, and {{alternate}} or multiple realities. The plot narrative unfolds through the silent or subconscious thoughts of Ruth Carson, {{who is a}} by-stander to the main events taking place around her. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> regularly shown to express conflicting ideas between <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> actually thinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{woman is}} well nigh a fool {{at the best}} of times," [...] he said irritably, [...] "and at present she knows no more <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> than a baby. Her mind is thrown {{completely}} off any little balance that it had and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> to all intents and purposes a lunatic." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the child}} paused, she looked confidingly at Sidney, who smiled assent to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she exclaimed, as if {{still too}} much perturbed to know quite <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I--I {{did not mean}} to {{interrupt}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never saw}} {{anything}} but supercilious irony,' she answered, {{in the same}} dreamy, indifferent way, as if hardly aware <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> and still moving on.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, for ages, for ages,” {{she exclaimed}} hastily, {{frowning}} a little, {{then she went}} on addressing herself to Mills, apparently in continuation of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> before.|$|E
6000|$|... "But is it o' any use {{to think}} of her?" [...] said Adam. [...] "What dost say? Mother's made me as I hardly know where I <b>am,</b> with <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> to me this forenoon. She says she's sure Dinah feels for me more than common, and 'ud be willing t' have me. But I'm afraid she speaks without book. I {{want to know if}} thee'st seen anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lords," [...] said Wessex, {{quietly and}} earnestly, during the brief lull caused by this interruption, [...] "I entreat {{you in the}} name of justice, do not hear this lady; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> excited and overwrought and knows not the purport of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> [...] . . . You see for yourselves <b>she</b> <b>is</b> scarce {{conscious}} of her actions. [...] . . . I have made full confession [...] . . . there rests nothing to be done. [...] . . ." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jasmine is {{starting}} to pursue her acting career and has been busy auditioning for roles in Los Angeles. She has recently {{caught the attention of}} the acting agent Mitchell Gossett (the agent of Miley Cyrus), who is now representing Jasmine as her agent. [...] "Jasmine has the natural ability to deliver a concept, and pull you into <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> I look forward to being a part of her future success in this industry." [...] says Gossett.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Worth, {{without any}} very {{clear sense of}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Her face was uncomfortably flushed and she was glad when tea was announced.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cousin Sarah, {{the other}} evening," [...] she said, [...] "asked you to please leave us. I think she hardly knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> and I {{hope you have}} not taken offense." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Caleb, {{seeing a}} {{beautiful}} lily growing in a border, {{as they were}} walking by, stopped to gather it. Madam Rachel was afraid {{that he was not}} attending to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Later, while Rosella {{is singing}} {{and working in}} the garden, Prince Harold rides by and, on noticing the jewels {{scattered}} around, proposes to Rosella, who accepts. The prince assigns attendants to catch the jewels whenever Rosella speaks {{and even though he}} asks her many questions, he is too focused on the jewels to listen to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> As the days pass, Rosella begins to feel very ill, but Prince Harold insists on making her speak.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated--nay, I should rather say paused, {{for there}} was little {{hesitation}} in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did. She paused, as though weighing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to <b>say</b> next.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>what</b> can <b>she</b> {{found her}} {{behaviour}} on? <b>What</b> had <b>she</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> {{to you this}} morning to make her tremble and turn pale in that way?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] he {{interrupted}} her. He had caught {{at last the}} drift of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> [...] "There {{is no need for}} any comedy, Suzanne. Enough of that had we at Boisvert." ...|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{looked down}} at the woman and tried to make out {{something}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> but could not. The dogs still barked spasmodically, drops fell from the tall, dark trees that rose overhead.|$|E
60|$|While Mary Anna {{was saying}} this, Caleb was {{standing}} with his hand upon the latch of the door, ready to go; and when she had finished <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> he started off to find Raymond.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I don't gossip. She {{comes and}} bores {{me to death}} with talking, and then goes off and {{mistakes}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> for <b>what</b> I said." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Kouloub’s most {{well-known}} works is Ramza. Jana Braziel performed a literary {{analysis of this}} novel, claiming that it is both autobiographically and historically relevant. Braziel asserts in her essay that Ramza speaks for women’s rights in Egypt. Braziel also {{draws attention to the}} fact that Kouloub uses many important historical figures in her writing. By doing this, Kouloub emphasizes the severity of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Nayra Atiya, English translator of Ramza, tells us that one of Kouloub’s messages was that “ignorance breeds fears and misconceptions and perpetuates mindless superstition.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... 7th Day Sequence: Paola, the {{adolescent}} waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary {{but the words}} they exchange are lost on the wind, {{drowned out by the}} crash of the waves. He signals his inability to understand <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman did}} not finish <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> A loud report rang out on deck, {{followed}} by the distant crash of glass. Then came a yell, followed by another report and more crashing of glassware.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} into his face. So intent had she been on what she had meant {{to tell him that}} she did not until now {{perceive}} he was preoccupied, and only half listening to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not seem}} to {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> He stared at her piteously, and he said with an effort: [...] "Adeline, I didn't know about that accident. I didn't know you thought I was dead, or I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{remembered the}} {{instruction}} given to Fanny. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{to write to}} Brussels. Let her therefore write at once. He would arrange <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to <b>say.</b> Under his dictation, therefore, Fanny wrote as follows:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said, {{as if she}} did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> 'Yes,' and <b>she</b> swallowed, and tried to regain her mind. But she could not, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> witless, decentralised. Use all her will as she might, she could not recover. She {{suffered}} the ghastliness of dissolution, broken and gone in a horrible corruption. And he stood and looked at her unmoved. She strayed out, pallid and preyed-upon like a ghost, like one attacked by the tomb-influences which dog us. And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone like a corpse, that has no presence, no connection. He remained hard and vindictive.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> hesitated; <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} <b>say</b> had {{something}} of the anti-climax in it.|$|R
