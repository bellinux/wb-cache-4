60|$|Later I {{heard the}} {{particulars}} of a hard and spectacular fight Judge Shields had had with a strange fish which the Smithsonian declared to be a waahoo. The name waahoo {{appears to be more}} familiarly associated with a shrub called burning-bush, also a Pacific coast berry, and again a small tree of the South called <b>winged</b> <b>elm.</b> When this name is mentioned to a fisherman he is apt to think only fun is intended. To be sure, I thought so.|$|E
5000|$|The name Wahoo {{is said to}} {{have come}} from Creek word ûhawhu, meaning cork or <b>winged</b> <b>elm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Winged</b> <b>Elm</b> {{cultivar}} Ulmus alata ''''Lace Parasol'''' http://www.virtualplanttags.com/img/.jpg?pl=39284&pr=1&size=3&r=43 {{was found}} by a North Carolina nurseryman growing in local woods. Removed to his yard, it remained there until his death, when it was removed again to the North Carolina State Arboretum in Raleigh by J. C. Raulston.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the town’s name is unknown. The word “wahoo” itself {{does not appear in}} any of the native languages, but English {{settlers}} anglicized the Muskogee word “vhahwu” to “wahoo” circa 1770. Sumter County historians believe that the town’s name is derived from the wahoo trees, or the <b>winged</b> <b>elms,</b> that grew in the area.|$|R
50|$|Shellbark hickory {{commonly}} {{grows in}} association with American (Ulmus americana), slippery (U. rubra), and <b>winged</b> <b>elms</b> (U. alata), white (Fraxinus americana) and green ash (F. pennsylvanica), basswood (Tilia americana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), red maple (Acer rubrum), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides). It is found {{in association with}} four other hickories-shagbark, mockernut, bitternut (Carya cordiformis), and water (C. aquatica), and numerous oak species, including swamp white (Quercus bicolor), pin (Q. palustris), white (Q. alba), Shumard (Q. shumardii), water (Q. nigra), Delta post (Q. stellata var. paludosa), swamp chestnut (Q. michauxii), and Nuttall (Q. nuttallii).|$|R
50|$|Nutmeg hickory {{is not an}} {{important}} species in any forest cover type and is only a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 91). Other prominent associates in this type include white ash (Fraxinus americana); shagbark hickory(Carya ovata), shellbark hickory(Carya laciniosa), mockernut hickory(C. tomentosa), and bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis); Shumard oak (Quercus shumardii); and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Less important associates are willow oak(Quercus phellos), water oak(Qercus nigra), and Durand oaks (Quercus durandii); American elm (Ulmus americana) and <b>winged</b> <b>elms</b> (Ulmus alata); yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera); and American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Some common small trees and shrubs occurring with nutmeg hickory are eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya uirginiana), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), and oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia). One survey near Charleston, SC, found red buckeye (Aesculus pavia), eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), and witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) associated with nutmeg hickory.|$|R
5000|$|The Forest {{contains}} extensive woodlands of stunted Northern Red Oak, White Oak, Post Oak, and Blackjack Oak at elevations over 2500 ft and on steep, dry slopes. [...] These woodlands, {{of little}} commercial value, were never logged {{and the extent}} of old growth forest within them may total nearly 800000 acre. [...] There are also old-growth woodlands of Eastern Redcedar, Gum Bumelia, <b>Winged</b> <b>Elm,</b> and Yaupon along some streams.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{contains}} mainly post oaks, white oaks, stunted blackjack oaks, eastern red cedar, black hickory, farkleberry, <b>winged</b> <b>elm,</b> lowbush blueberry, service berry, red elm, sassafras, winged sumac and aromatic sumac. The glade flora includes rushfoil, rough buttonweed, broomsedge, poverty grass, yellow star grass, little bluestem, flame flowers, {{prickly pear}} cactus, spider wort, wild hyacinth, lance leaf coreopsis, pine-weed {{and a variety}} of lichen. Fauna species include two species of lizards, fence and collared, lichen grasshoppers, and prairie warblers.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{vegetation}} in the Southeast is forests, {{with much}} of the sandy coastal regions dominated by old growth forests of loblolly pine, longleaf pine, shortleaf pine and slash pine, and inland areas have deciduous forests usually consisting of various pine species along with oak, hickory, sweetgum, blackgum, red maple and <b>winged</b> <b>elm.</b> The main grasses found in the Southeast are bluestem, panicums, and longleaf uniola, with dogwood, viburnum, haw, blueberry, American beautyberry, youpon, and numerous woody vines being common as well.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a member}} of the flora in {{hardwood}} forests with sandy or silty substrates over limestone rock. The forests are dominated by magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), pignut hickory (Carya glabra), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), live oak (Quercus virginiana), water oak (Quercus nigra), <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata). Other plants in the understory include hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), and yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria).|$|E
50|$|This rare {{plant is}} known {{only from a}} 2.5-mile stretch of the Yadkin River in North Carolina. It grows along the banks in cracks in the mafic bedrock. It can also anchor in {{concrete}} at the bases of local dams. It is sometimes subjected to scouring by floodwaters. It may grow alongside other plants, including Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata), sweet-gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), false indigo (Amorpha fruticosa), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), orangegrass (Hypericum gentianoides), and white false indigo (Baptisia alba).|$|E
50|$|Ulmus alata, the <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> or wahoo, is a small- to {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree {{endemic to}} the woodlands {{of the southeastern}} and south-central United States. The species is tolerant {{of a wide range}} of soils, and of ponding, but is the least shade-tolerant of the North American elms. Its growth rate is often very slow, the trunk increasing in diameter by less than 5 mm per year. The tree is occasionally considered a nuisance as it readily invades old fields, forest clearings, and rangelands, proving particularly difficult to eradicate with herbicides.|$|E
50|$|It {{grows in}} {{association}} with white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Q. velutina), northern red oak (Q. rubra), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (A. rubrum), hickories (Carya spp.), black cherry (Prunus serotina), cucumbertree (Magnolia acuminata), white ash (Fraxinus americana), American basswood (Tilia americana), black walnut (Juglans nigra), butternut (J. cinerea), and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). American beech (Fagus grandifolia), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), pitch pine (P. rigida), Virginia pine (P. virginiana), Ozark chinkapin (Castanea ozarkensis), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), bluejack oak (Quercus incana), southern red oak (Q. falcata), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata) also grow {{in association with}} chinkapin oak. In the Missouri Ozarks a redcedar-chinkapin oak association has been described.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern towhee}} occurs in {{vegetation}} of disturbed areas, such as old-field successional vegetation and shrubby areas of power line right-of-ways. In northwestern Arkansas, eastern towhees occurred in old-field vegetation where dwarf sumac (Rhus copallina) {{occurred at a}} frequency of 28.6%, <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata) at a frequency of 21%, and black cherry (Prunus serotina) at a frequency of 19.2%. Shrubby vegetation along power lines commonly is used by eastern towhees. For example, in Maryland, eastern towhee territories along a power line right-of-way corresponded with shrubby areas containing species such as Allegheny blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis) and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.). Other species included hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), black cherry, and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia).|$|E
50|$|Fernbank Forest is a 65-acre (25 hectares) mature {{mixed forest}} {{that is part}} of Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta, Georgia. It has one of the few {{remnants}} of original forest vegetation in the Georgia Piedmont; as such, it has been extensively studied by scientists. Large specimens of white oak and tulip poplar, which grow up to 156 feet (47.5 meters) tall, dominate the tree canopy. There also are a few equally tall loblolly pine. Other canopy species include American beech, black oak, northern red oak, southern red oak, pignut hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory, <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> and red maple. Eastern flowering dogwood, sourwood, umbrella magnolia and eastern redbud are prominent among the smaller trees. The forest floor is covered by many shrub, wildflower, and fern species.|$|E
50|$|As its {{common and}} {{scientific}} names imply, <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> is most easily {{recognized by the}} very broad, thin pair of corky wings that form along the branchlets {{after a couple of}} years. The tree generally grows to a maximum height and breadth of about 13 × 13 m, although on fertile alluvial soils such as those of the Mississippi River Delta, some specimens have reached double this height (see 'Notable trees' below). The crown can be either rounded or pyramidal; the branches are pendulous. The leaves are comparatively small for the genus, less than 6.5 cm long and less than 2.0 cm broad, oblong-lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, thin in texture, and smooth above. The wind-pollinated perfect apetalous flowers are borne on long pedicels in March and April before the leaves appear. The reddish samaras are also relatively small, less than 8 mm long, narrowly elliptic with two long incurving stigmas at the tip, and usually disperse before the end of April.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Vascular plants were collected in Madison County, Texas from 1996 - 2000 to create a vouchered record of species occurance, abundance, and habitat preference. Plants were collected from 233 sites in the county that are described by thirteen major vegetational habitats. These include three aquatic habitats, two riparian habitats, epiphytic and parasitic habitats, and six upland and lowland habitats divided into open, mixed, and wooded cover types. Three upland woods plant associations are described: Post Oak - <b>Winged</b> <b>Elm</b> - Yaupon, Blackjack Oak - Post Oak - <b>Winged</b> <b>Elm,</b> and Southern Red Oak - Sweet Gum - Post Oak. Unique habitats, including springs, pineywoods, and canyons are described. Typical species for all habitats are listed and appendices contain complete lists of taxa. The county supports ten species endemic to Texas, one of which is federally endangered. One species, Vicia lutea, was found to be new to Texas. The Madison County flora is comprised of 994 species in 469 genera and 121 families. The five largest plant families are Poaceae (134 species), Asteraceae (130 sp.), Fabaceae (strict sense) (74 sp.), Cyperaceae (63 sp.), and Euphorbiaceae (32 sp.). These families possess approximately 44 % of the species collected in the county...|$|E
30|$|Matlack (2015) argued forcefully that fire-intolerant species {{currently}} {{occur in}} mesic deciduous forests and that recent invasion by these species following modern fire exclusion (as suggested by Nowacki and Abrams 2008) was unlikely, given {{the short time}} scale of modern fire exclusion relative to the low rates of dispersal and colonization of fire intolerant species (Matlack 1994). He therefore concluded that fire was not a historically important factor in mesic deciduous forests. It {{is important to recognize}} that Matlack and Nowacki and Abrams are not referring to the same “fire-intolerant” species. Matlack is primarily considering poorly dispersed forest herbs (Matlack 1994), whereas Nowacki and Abrams (2008) are primarily considering widely dispersed tree species, such as red maple. In north Mississippi, invasion of upland oak forests from adjacent floodplains, mesic terraces, and steep ravines by red maple and fire-sensitive pioneer tree species such as sweetgum and <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata Michx.) following modern fire exclusion is entirely plausible (Brewer 2001). Furthermore, to call red maple, sweetgum, and <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> fire-intolerant species is not entirely accurate. The ability of these fire-sensitive tree species to resprout following fire could have prevented their complete elimination in the face of frequent fires, historically. Their slow regrowth following topkill by fire compared to oaks (Brose et al. 1999, Hutchinson et al. 2012, Cannon and Brewer 2013), however, likely prevented their escaping a “fire trap” (sensu Bond and Midgley 2001), relegating them to a sprout bank. Their persistence as sprouts prior to modern fire exclusion could partly explain their rarity among witness trees in fire prone areas during General Land Office surveys but also could have contributed to their subsequent rapid increase following fire exclusion. The resulting increase in canopy closure reduced the abundance of herbaceous species indicative of open woodlands and some light-flexible forest herbs, both of which (as shown in the current study) are tolerant of repeated fires.|$|E
40|$|Post oak flatwoods are {{an unusual}} plant {{community}} type dominated by even-aged and uniformly sized post oaks (Quercus stellata) growing along level terraces of the Ohio River. Historical evidence exists that fire {{may play a}} role in the maintenance of the open canopy and poorly-developed understory characteristic of this community type (Dolan and Menges. 1989). The results of summer vegetation surveys taken yearly from 1989 to 1992 in a post oak flatwoods in southwestern Indiana that was subjected to a prescribed bum in the spring of 1989 are reported in this paper. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of the burn on tree-and herb-layer vegetation. The fire killed or top-killed more than half the trees but did not markedly shift the rank order of species importance values. Mortality was greatest among small tree species, such as <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> and shingle-bark oak, and least among post oak. Composition of the herb-layer did not change greatly following the fire. but several new species were found that did not occur in unburned control plots. The results indicate that fire contributes to the unusual species composition and community structure of post oak flatwoods...|$|E
40|$|The Post Oak Savannah {{occupies}} about 3. 4 {{million hectares}} of gently rolling to hilly lands in east central Texas. Large post oak (Quercus stellata Wangenh.) blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Munchh.), Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) and honey mesquite (Juniperus virginiana L.) usually form the overstory, often above thickets of yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), <b>winged</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus alata), gum bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum Michx. Subsp. Oblongifolium (Nutt) T. D. Penn.), and live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.). Historically limited to rocky hillsides and draws (Owens and Ansley 1997), these species have migrated {{over the last}} several hundred years into bottomlands where grasses once dominated, and the increase in abundance and range has fluctuated due to both the modification of the historic fire regime and overgrazing (Smeins and Fuhlendorf 1997). The primary focus of previous fire studies in the Post Oak Savannah have been ignition time, mortality rate and the effect of burning to the understory vegetation, not standing shrub biomass estimation. Biomass estimation equations developed in different regions may not be applicable to the Post Oak Savannah since these substitutions may result in substantial error (Grier and Milne 1981, Gottfried and Severson 1994). With better prediction equations for this region with an increasing Urban-Wildfire Interface, managers can more accurately estimate the potential severity of wildfires or the effects of prescribed burns (Martin et al. 1978). Biomass estimation methods that involve juniper species have focused on Pinyon-Juniper (Pinus edulis and Juniperus spp.) and overstory-understory interactions in the western states. Schnell (1976) developed biomass prediction equations tables for eastern redcedar in Georgia, Alabama Tennessee and Virginia, that required diameters at breast height (DBH) 3 ̆e 12. 7 cm. Clark et al. (1986) and Phillips (1981) developed equations for estimating post oak biomass in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, using DBH and total height; Phillips (1981) also age, but neither included foliage. Common in both studies was a DBH 3 ̆e 15. 2 cm and total height as independent variables. There is little biomass estimation information available for gum bumelia, although Bryant and Kothmann (1979) suggested a quadratic equation might work best. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop regression models to predict the total above-ground biomass for three species commonly found in Post Oak Savannah plant communities...|$|E
