5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine <b>workings.</b> The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the <b>workings</b> were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E

5|$|Moana, a CGI fantasy-adventure film, was {{released}} in November 2016. The film was shown in theaters with the animated short Inner <b>Workings.</b> Moana was another commercial and critical success for the studio, grossing over $600 million worldwide and receiving two Academy Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{exists in}} the way of firsthand {{accounts}} of life within the society. In an effort to dispel some of the misconceptions and rumors about the society, Beilhart wrote extensively for newspapers to explain the <b>workings</b> of the group.|$|E
5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage into mine <b>workings</b> at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of seepage is much higher than a number of other streams in the area.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Waterhouse– son of {{prominent}} Puritan Drake Waterhouse, roommate of Isaac Newton, friend of Gottfried Leibniz, and prominent {{member of the}} Royal Society. Waterhouse is both a savant and a strict Puritan. As Quicksilver progresses he {{becomes more and more}} involved in the inner <b>workings</b> of British politics.|$|E
5|$|GURPS Discworld (Steve Jackson Games, 1998) and GURPS Discworld Also (Steve Jackson Games, 2001) are {{role-playing}} source books {{which were}} written by Terry Pratchett and Phil Masters, which offer insights into the <b>workings</b> of the Discworld. The first of these two books was re-released in September 2002 {{under the name of}} The Discworld Roleplaying Game, with art by Paul Kidby.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight <b>workings</b> from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional <b>workings</b> ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to <b>workings</b> in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no {{application}} was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore {{would have had to}} ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Butler wrote a {{book titled}} War Is a Racket, where he {{described}} and criticized the <b>workings</b> of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those he was a part of, including the American corporations and other imperialist motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{was carried}} out in Ruthwaite Cove, and the remains of several levels and some shallow open <b>workings</b> are visible near Ruthwaite Lodge. These {{excavations}} were made in a search for lead-bearing galena, and are believed to have been worked in the 16th century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862; the last known operation was in 1880.|$|E
5|$|On July 7, 1941, Hansell went to London, England, as {{a special}} {{observer}} attached to the military attaché, where he was privy to the inner <b>workings</b> of RAF intelligence and their target folders on the German industrial infrastructure. In his memoir, Hansell stated that in the exchange of information, the AAF received nearly a ton of material, shipped back to the United States in a bomber.|$|E
5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details the <b>workings</b> of the Exchequer and gives an early {{account of how}} the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were {{the responsibility of the}} clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner <b>workings</b> of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{challenged}} {{this decision}} splitting their working arrangements, {{declaring that the}} division of its activities between three states was against the treaties and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage, claiming {{the right to decide}} its own <b>workings</b> to its own efficiency. In response, leaders annexed the decision to the Treaty of Amsterdam, including it in the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} both shell and <b>workings,</b> and {{analysis}} of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.|$|E
5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow <b>workings</b> of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E
5|$|Westhay Moor {{supports}} a nationally outstanding community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. At least 28 nationally notable invertebrate species also {{occur on the}} moor. The meadows, ditches, abandoned peat <b>workings</b> and hedgerows provide suitable breeding habitats for a diverse and nationally important breeding bird community.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was carried}} out by up to 2,300 navvies and 400 horses were brought in for the work. The {{workforce}} included 188 quarrymen, 102 stonemasons, 732 tunnel men, 738 labourers and 18 carpenters. Each day around 2150 wagon loads of rock and earth was removed from the <b>workings</b> to be tipped on the Wharfe embankment leading to the Arthington Viaduct.|$|E
5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. There is also evidence of iron <b>workings</b> in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} plot involves Merital and {{his desire}} to marry a woman named Helena, cousin to Matchless. He is kept from doing so externally by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the <b>workings</b> of her aunt, and internally by themselves. Against her uncles wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by this, Lady Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the <b>workings</b> of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|As {{an author}} of six books, Blancornelas was {{regarded}} by the press as a leading expert on organized crime and drug trafficking during his time. He {{was also the first}} man to publish a photograph of Ramón Arellano Félix, the former drug lord of the Tijuana Cartel. In response to the photo publication, the cartel attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997, but he managed to survive the attack and continued to report on the <b>workings</b> of Mexico's criminal underworld.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its <b>workings.</b> He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts {{had been}} fully explored, {{with more than}} 200 bodies raised to the surface in the {{preceding}} two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still unaccounted for. Toward {{the end of the}} month, the men voted to return to work, even though the western <b>workings</b> were still out of action and 11 bodies were still missing.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of the inner <b>workings</b> of Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the <b>workings.</b> Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} <b>workings</b> by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Each novel {{centers on}} the family of Atrus, a {{scientist}} and explorer who {{has the ability to}} write special books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This ability, known as the Art, was practiced extensively by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, who were only mentioned briefly in the original Myst game. The plot of each book reveals more of the Myst back-story and the <b>workings</b> of the D'ni.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the <b>workings</b> {{hampered}} rescue efforts, and it {{took several}} days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|Halperin also {{explores the}} {{pornography}} industry, the Oscars, and the travails of the casting couch phenomenon. Links to YouTube videos by Halperin are given throughout the book, to illustrate encounters {{he had with}} various entertainment personalities. Halperin meets with famous actors and celebrities including Barbra Streisand, George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, and asks them to share their advice with him about the <b>workings</b> of the entertainment industry. Halperin eventually lands a talent agent, and {{a role in the}} film The Aviator.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent several}} months of his {{imprisonment}} dictating {{a detailed account of}} his travels to a fellow inmate, Rustichello da Pisa, who incorporated tales of his own as well as other collected anecdotes and current affairs from China. The book soon spread throughout Europe in manuscript form, and became known as The Travels of Marco Polo. It depicts the Polos' journeys throughout Asia, giving Europeans their first comprehensive look into the inner <b>workings</b> of the Far East, including China, India, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Like most fells in the Helvellyn range, Nethermost Pike has grassy western {{slopes and}} rocky {{outcrops}} {{on the eastern}} side. Geologically, Nethermost Pike belongs to the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Lead was once mined on its eastern slopes, resulting in open <b>workings</b> and underground mines. The eastern slopes are protected {{as part of a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest because of the Pike's geological and biological features, which include some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Low-cost {{loans for}} farmers and {{replaced}} the labor service {{with a tax}} instead, hoping this would ultimately help the <b>workings</b> of the entire economy and state (as he directly linked state income {{to the level of}} prosperity of rural peasants who owned farms, produced goods for the market, and paid the land tax). These government loans replaced the system of landlords offering their tenants private loans, which was prohibited under the new laws of Wang's reforms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the <b>workings</b> of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which are specific to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 2001, Tillingbourne {{abruptly}} ceased {{operations and}} {{was placed in}} the hands of receivers Begbies Traynor. This followed two years in which the company had lost around £450,000. The receivers blamed the losses on increasing costs, low subsidies from local councils and falling passenger numbers. The closure left 140 staff unemployed and caused large numbers of passengers to be stranded. Replacement services were organised by Surrey County Council and four bus operators, with the majority of routes being covered within days by temporary contracted services. Some schoolchildren were forced to find other means of transport, although <b>workings</b> on routes 62 and 63 were covered by Aventa Transport.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{also had}} the ability to {{converse}} with spectators using a letter board. The director, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, was able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret <b>workings.</b>|$|E
