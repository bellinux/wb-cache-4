5|$|In 1980, {{while in}} South Africa filming Safari 3000 (also known as Rally), which co-starred Stockard Channing, Carradine {{was arrested for}} {{possession}} of marijuana. He was convicted and given a suspended sentence. He claimed that he <b>was</b> <b>framed,</b> in this case, by the apartheid government {{as he had been}} seen dancing with Tina Turner.|$|E
5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|Although single western towers {{are common}} in English parish churches, only one medieval cathedral, Ely, retains a {{centrally}} placed western tower, and in that case, it <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by two lower lateral towers, one of which has since fallen down. Ely, alone among England’s cathedrals, has a central feature over the crossing that somewhat resembles the polygonal vaulted lantern towers of Spain. This elaborate lantern-like structure known as “The Octagon” spans both the nave and aisles, and is thus said to have inspired Christopher Wren’s design for the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its upper parts are supported by hidden wooden hammer-beams, an architectural device unique to English Gothic.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{frames of}} several {{different}} sizes are nested inside each other. For example, when using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over asynchronous serial communication, the eight bits {{of each individual}} byte <b>are</b> <b>framed</b> by start and stop bits, the payload data bytes in a network packet <b>are</b> <b>framed</b> by the header and footer, and several packets can <b>be</b> <b>framed</b> with frame boundary octets.|$|R

5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by a gigantic mask.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{takes her}} {{children}} Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey) to see Paul (Mark Pellegrino) in prison. He {{insists that he}} <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by Dexter—that Dexter dragged him out of Rita's house before drugging him and tipping off the police—and that if she could find his missing shoe it would prove his innocence. Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found it over a month ago. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night, she receives a call from Paul's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she <b>was</b> <b>framed.</b> By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 but by that time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) {{approved}} a follow-on {{class of the}} earlier Project 15 Delhi-class destroyers. The aim was that the follow-on class would incorporate {{a higher level of}} air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the follow-on Kolkata class to incorporate even higher levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata class (Project 15A) is a {{class of}} guided missile destroyers with stealth technology. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had {{redesigned}} the follow-on Kolkata class to improve technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL). It consists of three ships (Kolkata, Kochi and Chennai), built by Mazagon Dock Limited, which are the navy's largest destroyers. Due to construction delays and a problem discovered during sea trials, the first ship's commission was postponed from 2010 to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} guest performances {{from many}} actors including: Logan Miller, who was cast as Cole, Rex's best friend. Daniela Bobadilla appeared as Emma, who is Rex's girlfriend, currently. Bailey Chase, who played as David Walker. Clifton Powell as John Cooper, {{a man who}} was falsely accused of a crime ten years earlier. He <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by Jim Mayhew, played by William Russ. Jim Cantafio appeared as an IA Officer. Lolly Ward as Nancy, a man who had helped Cooper escape from jail. David Pease as Doubting Cop. Enrique Almeida, who was cast as Perez.

5|$|The {{historian}} Walter Goffart {{argues that}} Bede based {{the structure of}} the Historia on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For {{the early part of the}} work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used Gildas's De excidio. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> on the anonymous Life of Gregory the Great written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid. Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E
5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in {{separate}} occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks {{to the efforts of}} Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.|$|E

25|$|Velarde's oeuvre marks {{a moment}} of {{transition}} between modernism and the avant-garde. His work was marked by a novel approach to poetic language. At the same time, it <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> by duality, {{whether it be the}} Mexican struggle between rural traditions and the new culture of the cities, or his own struggle between asceticism and pagan sensuality.|$|E
25|$|The 1957 children's book Captain Kidd's Cat by Robert Lawson is {{a largely}} fictionalized account of Kidd's last voyage, trial and execution, told {{from the point}} of view of his loyal ship's cat.
