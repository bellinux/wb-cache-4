HSG attorney West then emailed the creditors of HSG on New Year's Eve saying [...] "Basically, the response from the MLB was to prohibit us from negotiating with anyone other than Greenberg. Their intent seems to be to lock us into Greenberg even though Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal – and may always have had based on Greenberg's current position. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>help</b> here. Unless the lenders weigh in, {{we are going to be}} stuck negotiating a deal that is clearly worse than Crane's."

He argued that the U.S. cannot return to a sustainable long-term fiscal path by either tax increases or cuts to non-healthcare cost categories alone; the U.S. must confront the rising healthcare costs driving expenditures in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.|$|E
