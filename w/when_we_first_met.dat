500|$|... "Rehab" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad with {{a subtle}} backbeat. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of G minor and set in common time, with a moderately slow groove. The vocal range spans nearly an octave {{and a half from}} F3 to B4. [...] "Rehab" [...] opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a violin, cello, and tambourine instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody. Rihanna then sings the opening lines, [...] "Baby, baby, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> I never felt something so strong".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{her first}} adult movie, Randy West said [...] "Jenna {{contacted}} {{me and said}} she wanted to get into the XXX business, but her agent didn't want her to do porn. A month later I'm on a shoot in Woodland Hills , and there's Jenna. She {{said she wanted to}} get into the business, despite what her agent said. I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody had any idea {{she was going to be}} as big as she turned out to be. Jenna told me <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> that she was going to be a star." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did you {{not tell}} us, <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> you, {{that you were}} heart-broken over the {{separation}} from your wife and children?" [...] she inquired in severe tones.|$|R
6000|$|Each {{moment as}} we nearer drew to each, [...] A stern respect {{withheld}} us farther yet, [...] So that we seemed beyond each other's reach, [...] And less acquainted than <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with a What's on TV journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is [...] "pretty normal". The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is [...] "something quite humbling about her." [...] Morey {{went on to say that}} Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained [...] "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused on that for now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think in}} {{statistics}} and percentages, averages and exceptions. I wonder, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> what particular formula you measured me up by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What CAN I do,' asked Howard Fry, 'To soothe that brother's pain? His glance <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> was keen, Most martial and erect his mien' (What mien may mean, I {{know not}} I) 'But HE must joy again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> {{he really}} was [...] "as bonny as a girlie"; with his oval face, his flushed cheeks, his brown eyes, large and radiant, and his hair of a length more romantic than conventional. He wore a wide blue cloak, with a grace which hovered between that of an Italian poet and an early pirate.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a long}} story, Zoola," [...] {{answered}} Noie, [...] "but here is {{the heart}} of it. I told you <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> that I am not of this people, although my mother was a Zulu. I told you that I am of the Dream-people, the Ghost-people, the little Grey-people, who live away to the north beneath their trees, and worship their trees." ...|$|R
6000|$|PURDIE. Yes, I hope so. But I {{think now}} of special little ways of giving her pleasure. That never-to-be-forgotten day <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> you and I! ...|$|E

60|$|Lysbeth van Goorl {{could no}} longer boast the beauty which was hers <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> her, {{but she was still}} a sweet and graceful woman, her figure {{remaining}} almost as slim as it had been in girlhood. The grey eyes also retained their depth and fire, only the face was worn, though more by care and the burden of memories than with years. The lot of the loving wife and mother was hard indeed when Philip the King ruled in Spain and Alva was his prophet in the Netherlands.|$|R
6000|$|... "What ails ye at my face, fair sir?" [...] she inquired, curtseying to {{the very}} ground; and then, when Dick had at length and most tepidly embraced her, [...] "Joanna," [...] she added, [...] "your {{sweetheart}} is very backward under your eyes; but I warrant you, <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> he was more ready. I am all black and blue, wench; trust me never, if I be not black and blue! And now," [...] she continued, [...] "have ye said your sayings? for I must speedily dismiss the paladin." ...|$|R
60|$|De Garcia {{heard this}} speech, that to-day {{seems to me}} to smack of the theatre, though it was spoken in grimmest earnest, and his face grew like the face of a trapped wolf. Yet I saw that he had no mind to fight, not because of cowardice, for to do him justice he was no coward, but because of superstition. He feared to fight with me since, as I learned afterwards, he {{believed}} that he would meet his end at my hand, and it was for this reason chiefly that he strove to kill me <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us talk, then, of scammony. But {{fifteen years}} ago, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> friend Darkush, {{you did not}} say nay to M. de Sidonia. It was the plague alone that stopped us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It matters little, now, Gervaise--it matters little, now. We {{were two}} light-hearted and gay lads, Oakes, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> as boys, fresh from school, and merry as health and spirits could make us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Brown {{with an air}} of apology. [...] "You see, I {{suspected}} you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> It's {{that little}} bulge up the sleeve where you people have the spiked bracelet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter how. I do know it; I have been sure {{of it from the}} moment <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> that night by the kloof. Although, perhaps, you felt nothing then, it was that gift of yours working upon a mind in tune, my mind, which led me there in time to save you, as it was that gift of yours which warned you of the {{disaster}} about to happen to the ship--oh! I have heard the story from your own lips. Your spirit can loose itself from the body: it can see the past and the future; it can discover the hidden things." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>first</b> and loved, I did {{not build}} Upon the event with marble. Could it mean To last, a love set {{pendulous}} between Sorrow and sorrow?

And, though I have grown serene And strong since then, I think that God has willed A still renewable fear [...] . O love, O troth [...] .

6000|$|... "Maiden," [...] {{he said in}} his gentle voice, [...] "maiden who soon {{shall be}} a wife, I do not sleep, {{although}} I dream of you as I have dreamt before. What did I say to you that day <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met?</b> That for you I had good tidings; that though death was all about you, you need not fear; that in this place you who had known great sorrow should find happiness and rest. Yet, maiden, you would not believe the words of the Munwali, spoken by his prophet's lips, as he at your side, who shall be your husband, would not believe me in years past when I told him that we should meet again." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ay, and she {{has done}} me the honour to open a {{correspondence}} with me, supposing me to be as deep in astrological mysteries as <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Here is her scroll, delivered {{to me by the}} Dominie.' ...|$|E
60|$|She spoke. The {{sound of}} her voice was not the mysterious sound that I had heard in the summer-house. It was the sound I had heard on the bridge <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> in the dim evening light.|$|E
6000|$|... "She lied fast enough, Master. She said--well, {{what she}} said <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> her, {{that there was more}} in me than the eye saw and that she who had lived so much with spirits looked to the spirit rather than to the flesh, and that dwarf or no she loved me and desired nothing better than to marry me and be my true and {{faithful}} wife and helpmeet. She lied so well that once or twice almost I believed her. At any rate I took her at her word, not altogether for myself, believe me, Master, but because without doubt what the holy Tanofir has shown us will come to pass, and it is necessary to you that I should be married." ...|$|R

60|$|Ernest. It cannot be. Much as I love my freedom, I love {{my honor}} more; and I am bound until my conqueror shall give back my plighted word, to seek no freedom till he shall bid me go. Nay, do not sigh, kind friend; I {{am no longer}} sad. From this day forth captivity is sweet. Tell thy fair {{mistress}} all my thanks are hers; but I may not take the gift she offers, for with freedom comes dishonor, and I cannot break my word to her stern father.

6000|$|For {{an instant}} I felt my heart stand still. Her miraculous {{sensitiveness}} of touch had detected the dark color of my dress, {{on the day}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Would it serve her, this time, as truly as it had served her then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said. [...] "But I doubt, now," [...] he continued, with {{a little}} deprecating wave of his tea-cup at me, [...] "if Miss M. can {{remember}} me. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> we were precisely one week old, precisely one week old." ...|$|E

We are going back to the origin of superstition--to an age when dragons tore each other in their slime. We must fear nothing--no conclusion, however improbable, almost impossible it may be. Life and death is hanging on our judgment, not only for ourselves, but for others whom we love. Remember, I count on you as I hope you count on me." ...|$|R

Then it was that he threw it at me. He might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was forever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She will not even tell me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that they come from a stab with a hatpin. The sly devil--God forgive me that I should speak of him so, now that he is dead! But a devil he was, if ever one walked the earth. He was all honey <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> him--only eighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She had only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her first voyage--she had never been from home before. He won her with his title and his money and his false London ways. If she made a mistake she has paid for it, if ever a woman did. What month did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was just after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were married in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning-room again, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too much of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand." ...|$|R
