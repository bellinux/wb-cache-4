25|$|Marlovians {{argue that}} if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, they {{could just as easily}} have been lying about the {{identity}} of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and as far as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E
25|$|Four newly raised ranging companies, {{have all}} been organized, and taken their several {{stations}} on our frontier. We are much pleased. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are true men, and they {{know exactly what they}} are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.|$|E
2500|$|Attorney General Holder said [...] "the Pakistani Taliban {{was behind}} the attack. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> that <b>they</b> helped {{facilitate}} it. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> that <b>they</b> probably helped finance it {{and that he was}} working at their direction".|$|R
60|$|The old {{hands had}} kept the matter quiet from us greenhorns, so that, {{although}} <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to do}} some sort of mischief, we didn't exactly understand what it was to be.|$|R
6000|$|And {{the thought}} was {{suddenly}} in his mind: [...] "We were quite aware of it and because <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> meant well by us {{according to their own}} view of the matter, we did not attempt to attack them." ...|$|R
2500|$|... exemplifies {{more clearly}} than most the {{fundamental}} absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits {{that they might be}} quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nazak Tarkhan is {{also said}} to have murdered not only the Chief Priest but also his sons. Only a young son was saved. He was taken by his mother to Kashmir where he was given {{training}} in medicine, astronomy and other sciences. Later they returned to Balkh. Prof. Maqbool Ahmed observes [...] "One is tempted {{to think that the}} family originated from Kashmir, for in time of distress, they took refuge in the Valley. Whatever it be, their Kashmiri origin is undoubted and this also explains the deep interest of the Barmaks, in later years, in Kashmir, for <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> were responsible for inviting several scholars and physicians from Kashmir to the Court of Abbasids." [...] Prof. Maqbool also refers to the descriptions of Kashmir contained in the report prepared by the envoy of Yahya bin Barmak. He surmises that the envoy could have possibly visited Kashmir during the reign of Samgramapida II (797–801). Reference has been made to sages and arts.|$|E
2500|$|The album has a {{score of}} 66 out of 100 from Metacritic, {{indicating}} [...] "generally favorable reviews". The New York Times gave the album a favorable review and said, [...] "The panache of the singing and the radiant complexity of the music--an achievement shared by Mr. Rodriguez Lopez {{and a handful of}} regular collaborators, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante--drive the album relentlessly forward. And it’s the subtle touches, no less than the sweeping ones, that leave an impression." [...] The Boston Globe also gave it a favorable review and said, [...] "Guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala are the creative duo driving the band and once again deliver on a standing promise to blow any mind that is willing to stay open." [...] Planet Sound gave it {{a score of}} seven out of ten and called it the band's [...] "most chilled-out and approachable record." [...] NME also gave it a score of seven out of ten and said it [...] "might be their ‘reflective’ effort, but it’s classic MV." [...] Under the Radar gave it seven stars out of ten and said, [...] "We already knew The Mars Volta could shred. Now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> can slow the pace too and be equally as compelling." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it [...] "isn’t a representation of the best The Mars Volta are capable of, but it is a glimpse into the power they possess when they better harness their capabilities." [...] musicOMH also gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said {{that for the first time}} the band [...] "really can do restraint, without compromising the overall impact of the instances where things are let rip." [...] Paste gave the album altogether a review averaging about 6.5 out of ten: Rachel Dovey gave it an eight out of ten and said that [...] "the group returns to dark balladry on 'Desperate Graves' and 'Copernicus,' two more highlights from a haunting album full of twilight poetry"; Corey DuBrowa, however, gave it five out of ten and called the album [...] "the sound of a band treading water." ...|$|E
5000|$|The drummer, Zac Hanson told People: [...] "Featuring our {{own kids}} made sense because <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> would share an honest performance”.

6000|$|... "Truly it is," [...] replied Thorward; [...] "but the {{question}} is, {{can this be}} the set of rascals who carried off the children? It seems to me that, being a small band, as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> {{did not belong to}} the same set." ...|$|E
