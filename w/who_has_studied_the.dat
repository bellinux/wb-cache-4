While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J.

500|$|A newly {{emergent}} threat {{facing the}} golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners {{moving into the}} region's forests. [...] Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing {{the trees in the}} area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of bushmeat. In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. [...] Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the impact of an online sport {{psychology}} education module on the attitudes and behaviours of qualified sports physiotherapists in the UK. Ninety-five sport physiotherapists studied either a sport psychology module or a control module, and their attitudes and behaviours towards sport psychology were measured prior to <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> module and at three points over a six-month period following its completion. It was found that those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> sport psychology module demonstrated an improvement in their attitudes towards sport psychology immediately following its completion that was significantly higher than those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> control module. Use of sport psychology also increased following the sport psychology module, with significant differences seen between the intervention and control group on the sport psychology subscale, indicating that those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> sport psychology module were integrating more sport psychology techniques into their practice than those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> control module.

[...] "95 percent of our congregations use the Revised Common Lectionary in some way in planning or actual worship and preaching" [...] and [...] "96 percent always or almost always have a sermon, 86 percent have a time with children, 95 percent have a time of sharing joys and concerns, and 98 percent include the Prayer of Our Savior/Lord's Prayer." [...] Clergy and laity were invited to select two meanings of baptism that they emphasize. They were also to suggest the meaning that they thought their entire church emphasized. Baptism as an [...] "entry into the Church Universal" [...] was the most frequent response. Clergy and laity were invited to identify two meanings of Holy Communion that they emphasize.

2500|$|On November 19, 1493, {{during his}} second voyage to the New World, Christopher Columbus {{encountered}} the island {{now known as}} Puerto Rico, which the natives called Borinquen (or Borikén according to some historians), and which Columbus named San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist). Within hours of setting foot in Puerto Rico, Columbus and his ships headed west to Hispaniola, where he expected to meet several crewmembers who had remained behind from his first voyage. [...] As he left Puerto Rico, he reputedly became the first European to sight the island on September 24, 1494, which was claimed for Spain. The name Mona derives from the Taíno name Ámona, bestowed by the natives {{in honor of the}} ruling Cacique or chief of the island. However, one amateur archaeologist (Rex Cauldwell) <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> Mona Island/Columbus sighting for over 14 years puts this in dispute with the following logic: [...] "Mona island is to the southwest corner of PR. Columbus is in a bay on the northwest corner. He is to sail from there straight across to the north coast of Hispaniola. Why would he sail south to where he has already been and then sail north again to Hispaniola? This is illogical. Mona Island was probably picked by armchair historians because it is the only island in the passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola that is drawn on most maps. [...] It is more logical that when Columbus left the northwest coast of Puerto Rico, the small island he saw had to be Desecheo—a famous diving destination not far off the northwest coast of PR. It was never considered by armchair authors because it is small, barren, and of no interest, it is not drawn on most maps." [...] In 1502, Fray Nicolás de Ovando was sent to Isla de la Mona to keep an eye, from a safe distance, on the native revolts occurring in Hispaniola. With a group of 2,000 Spanish settlers, Ovando was left in charge of creating a permanent settlement on the island. Due to its small size and location, the island proved inadequate to accommodate such a large settlement, and food became scarce as shipments from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico were received infrequently.|$|E
