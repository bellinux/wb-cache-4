The vidogoja were also thought to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.|$|E

5|$|The Pawnees did {{not live}} in their villages year-round. In the spring, they planted and hoed crops near their villages. In mid-June, they left on their summer buffalo hunt. In September, they {{returned}} to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival; they then cached {{a portion of their}} food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt, from <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not return until planting time in the spring.

Jane's disapproval of the match caused serious offence to Leigh Hunt and his family.|$|E

The two teams met again in March 2012, where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> with a 16–9 victory. This was {{followed}} immediately by an eight-match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations, where Wales retained the Championship {{for the first time}} since 1979 wins. Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost 23–19 to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the second World War in 1941, the Oval – {{including}} terraces, offices, kits and club records – was destroyed in a bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff Shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery to play at Grosvenor Park, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs, most notably Cliftonville. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> until he died.|$|E

5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E

To research the enemy, Nosaka and his crew took care to analyze current events in Japan and China, <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> by stocking Japanese newspapers, magazines, journals, and diaries that were purchased or seized on the battlefield.|$|E
