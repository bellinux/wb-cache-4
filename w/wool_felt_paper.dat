50|$|Aluminium {{silicate}} {{is a type}} of {{fibrous material}} made of aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide, (such materials are also called aluminosilicate fibres). These are glassy solid solutions rather than chemical compounds. The compositions are often described in terms of % weight of alumina, Al2O3 and silica, SiO2. Temperature resistance increases as the % alumina increases. These fibrous materials can be encountered as loose <b>wool,</b> blanket, <b>felt,</b> <b>paper</b> or boards.|$|R
40|$|<b>Felting</b> of <b>wool</b> is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a household tumble dryer were developed for testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Results with the loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. Loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), crimp frequency (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). Loose wool bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage. Loose wool feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained. Part of this is probably due to variation in yarn characteristics and {{there is a need for}} a method of producing short-lengths of yarn of constant structure from very small wool samples. The sire effect was significant (P< 0. 05) and controlled 6. 5 % of the variation in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and 12 % in yarn shrinkage. This indicates that selection for either increased or decreased loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage would induce changes in a flock. Further investigation into the effect of scale height is warranted to enhance understanding of variation in felting...|$|R

A moldable, lightweight material into which other materials and forms can easily be embedded, <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> has a distinct aesthetic and an inviting tactile duality. The Felt PET project challenges urban dwellers to see that material/structural innovations and strategic spatial effects can be produced from <b>wool</b> <b>felt.</b> The claddings I propose are designed around common activities and events. They intentionally shift between addressing {{the body and the}} architectural interior spaces the body inhabits. Though handcrafted and idiosyncratic, <b>felting</b> <b>wool</b> can produce claddings whose function and program vary across a continuous surface or landscape. By capitalizing on the enormous potential of wool for producing soft, flexible, portable, innovative, and playful interior environments, I see Felt PET as a viable and critical choice for a contemporary cultural artifact.

50|$|Captain Chauvin {{made the}} first {{organized}} attempt to control the fur trade in New France. In 1599 he acquired a monopoly from Henry IV and tried to establish a colony {{near the mouth of}} the Saguenay River at Tadoussac. French explorers, voyageurs and Coureur des bois such as Étienne Brûlé, Samuel de Champlain, Radisson, La Salle, and Le Sueur, while seeking routes through the continent, established relationships with Amerindians and continued to expand the trade of fur pelts for items considered 'common' by the Europeans. Mammal winter pelts were prized for warmth, particularly animal pelts for beaver <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> hats, which were an expensive status symbol in Europe. The demand for beaver <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> hats was such that the beaver in Europe and European Russia had largely disappeared through exploitation.|$|R

40|$|Glass/wool felts hybrid {{laminates}} {{have been}} manufactured by hand lay-up using an epoxy resin {{and subjected to}} tensile, flexural and falling weight impact loading up to penetration. Two configurations with glass mat skins and <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> cores with different thickness were compared and impact behaviour of both configurations was modelled. It can be suggested that the insertion of two <b>wool</b> <b>felts</b> instead of one in the laminate core would slightly improve their tensile and impact characteristics, less so for flexural ones. However, early occurrence of pull-out and the likely presence of porosity were found to affect {{the performance of the}} laminates, especially in terms of the appearance of early damage under impact loading. On the other side, the model proved largely capable of predicting the features of impact hysteresis cycles on these structures, which presented some mechanical complexity due to the tendency of wool fibres to be highly coiled in felts...|$|R
50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover cloth diapers. Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. <b>Wool</b> <b>felted</b> and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor.
