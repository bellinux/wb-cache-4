25|$|Scabies may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>across</b> the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E

50|$|In {{any given}} day, a {{celestial}} object <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> to drift <b>across</b> the upper meridian as the Earth rotates, for the meridian is {{fixed to the}} local horizon.

5000|$|A lot of {{problems}} when filming TV and computer screens {{are based on the}} different frame rates involved. The standard for film projection is 24 fps. In countries like the United States that use the NTSC system for television broadcast, the frame rate is 30 fps (actually 29.97). When the camera's shutter is not in sync with the NTSC monitor, thick, dark horizontal bands or bars <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> and drift <b>across</b> the screen. These are called [...] "roll bars". A sync box with phase control is used to eliminate the roll bars.|$|R
40|$|AFIT-ENG-MS- 15 -M- 019 To date, {{much effort}} has been spent on {{improving}} the detection of space objects; however, the ability to track and catalogue space objects remains {{only as good as}} the ability to determine the object’s position and angular rate. The foundation of space situational awareness (SSA) is the ability to detect a space object and to predict its location in the future. In order to accomplish SSA for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) space objects, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) developed the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) to enable ground-based, broad-area search, detection and tracking of small GEO objects in space. In general, the SST tracks along the sky at the sidereal rate where the stars <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> to be stationary, while objects within space not moving at this rate <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> to move <b>across</b> the focal array from data frame to data frame.

5000|$|The game {{incorporates}} a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985), the player has a morality meter {{that can be}} aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called [...] "MF" [...] (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>across</b> the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear {{in the form of}} random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike Hydlide II, however, the morality meter no longer affects {{the way in which the}} townsfolk react to the player.|$|E
40|$|Coupled {{inductors}} {{have been}} used with impedance-source networks, extended from the earlier Z-source network, to keep their shoot-through times short, while providing high-voltage gains. A commonly stated requirement for these networks is that their magnetic couplings must be strong or their leakage inductances must be small. This {{is often difficult to}} achieve in practice especially at high switching frequencies. It is therefore necessary to understand the effects that leakage inductances have on the performance of these converters. In this letter, we address these issues for the latest Y-source network, showing in particular that voltage spikes <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> <b>across</b> its switching devices in some, but not all, cases. Experimental results verifying the findings have been obtained and presented {{at the end of this}} letter. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This Essay, which <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> in <b>Across</b> the Great Divide: New Perspectives on the Financial Crisis, a Brookings Institution and Hoover Institution book, {{begins with}} a brief {{overview}} of concerns raised by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy about the adequacy of our existing architecture for resolving the financial distress of systemically important financial institutions. The principal takeaway of the first section is that Title II as enacted left most of these issues unanswered. By contrast, the FDIC’s new single point of entry strategy, which is introduced in the second section, can be seen as addressing nearly all of them. The third and fourth sections point out some of the limitations of single point of entry, first by highlighting potential pitfalls and distortions and then by explaining that single point of entry does not end the too-big-to-fail problem and would not reduce worrisome concentration in the financial services industry. The final section turns to bankruptcy, which remains the strategy of choice for resolving even systemically important financial institutions and considers how a single-entry-style strategy could be used in bankruptcy. Indeed, the strategy harkens back to the original procedure used to reorganize American railroads well over a century ago...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} packetization and {{reconstruction}} algorithms in transmission of JPEG coded images over lossy channels are proposed. An interleaving method is devised that maximizes the minimum {{distance between the}} 8 # 8 blocks, used in JPEG, {{that are in the}} same packet. Then a method for estimating the missing DC coe#cients of a JPEG coded image which is required for decoding the compressed image, is suggested and evaluated. As e#ects of errors in estimating the missing DC value <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> as stripes <b>across</b> the image, a postprocessing technique for removing such stripes is also developed. Finally the missing data is reconstructed by exploiting the correlation between adjacent blocks. A novel reconstruction technique which has a good performance in reconstruction of edges is proposed. Simulation results indicate that our algorithms perform very well, even when more than one packet is lost during transmission of the JPEG coded image.

40|$|Galactic neutral {{hydrogen}} (HI) {{within a}} few hundred parsecs of the Sun contains structure with an angular distribution {{that is similar to}} small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). A total of 108 associated pairs of associated HI and WMAP features have now been cataloged using HI data mapped in 2 km/s intervals and these pairs show a typical offset of 0. 8 degrees. A large-scale statistical test for a direct association is carried out that casts little additional light on whether the these small offsets are merely coincidental or carry information. To pursue the issue further, the nature of several of the features within the foreground HI most closely associated with WMAP structure are examined in detail and it is shown that the cross-correlation coefficient for well-matched pairs of structures is of order unity. It is shown that free-free emission from electrons in unresolved density enhancements in interstellar space could theoretically produce high-frequency radio continuum radiation at the levels observed by WMAP and that such emission <b>will</b> <b>appear</b> nearly flat <b>across</b> the WMAP frequency range. Evidence for such structure in the interstellar medium already exists in the literature. Until higher angular resolution observations of the high-frequency continuum emission structure as well as the apparently associated HI structure become available, {{it may be difficult to}} rule out the possibility that some if not all the small-scale structure usually attributed to the cosmic microwave background may have a galactic origin...|$|R
