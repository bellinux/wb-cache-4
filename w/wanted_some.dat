5|$|In 1983, an {{extended}} cut {{was released on}} VHS and premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12minutes to the film. The added footage was largely unfinished, and cobbled together for the network premiere; Wise hadn't <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> of the footage {{to be included in}} the final cut of the film. This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{commissioned}} {{to repair a}} chimney at a local brewery. While working on this, he met a local welder who also knew the vicar of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> repairs made to Bolton parish church's weathervanes. The vicar drove a 1929Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah's AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the vicar asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the vicar enabled him to gain more work from the local clergy.|$|E

500|$|Gardner {{spent his}} summers at the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, and thus often relied on Valiente {{to deal with}} his affairs in Southern England. He sent her to meet with the occult artist Austin Osman Spare when he <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> talismans {{produced}} by the latter. Spare subsequently described Valiente as [...] "a myopic stalky nymph... harmless and a little tiresome" [...] in a letter that he wrote to Kenneth Grant. At Gardner's prompting, she also met with the occultist Gerald Yorke, who was interested in learning about Wicca; Gardner insisted that she lie to Yorke by informing him that she was from a longstanding family of hereditary Wiccan practitioners. She also aided him in preparing his second non-fiction book about Wicca, The Meaning of Witchcraft, focusing in particular on those sections refuting the sensationalist accusations of the tabloid press.|$|E
500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, {{who did not know}} about the poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E

500|$|According to writer Peter Buckley, {{the record}} {{presented}} a faster, [...] "thrashier kind of heavy metal". Steve Huey of AllMusic opined {{that the music}} on Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is predominantly [...] "chaotic", accompanied by [...] "lightning-fast" [...] solo sections. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, {{he noted that the}} music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his book , editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried [...] "like a runaway train". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that [...] "extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.|$|E
500|$|Axelrod {{composed}} Song of Innocence in {{one week}} and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer. He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists. Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33players to perform his notated charts. He {{had learned how to}} read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky. [...] "That way the sounds don't seem to go all over the place", he later said. [...] "Music seems so small in a studio." [...] Axelrod originally <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale choir but was uncertain if he could find the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, {{but it was}} never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads [...] "Cash Loan" [...] in a red font, followed by [...] "Buy · Sell · Trade" [...] in a green font below.

Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled [...] "8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos That We Really Need To See". Rosa noted that the video [...] "is now virtually unfindable on the Web", and was disappointed by stating: [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> Madonna realness, Gwen!" ...|$|E

500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{presented a}} {{legend of the}} Fairy Flag's origin. This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land. On his journey homewards, the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of Palestine. Here, he met a hermit who gave him food and shelter. The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass, which had never failed to destroy a true believer. However, {{with the aid of}} a piece of the True Cross and certain directions from the hermit, the MacLeod is able to defeat the [...] "She Devil"—who is called [...] "Nein a Phaipen, or Daughter of Thunder". In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> friends to know, she revealed to the MacLeod [...] "the future destinies of the Clan". The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man's family until its extinction. The spirit then gave the Macleod her girdle, telling him to convert it into a banner. The MacLeod then used his spear as a flag pole. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost, and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever. The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag. The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land, and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark called Williams' a [...] "sometimes overly {{transparent}} {{effort to}} underscore the grief of the victims' survivors", and said the episode [...] "works overtime" [...] {{to make the world}} seem like a [...] "bleak and scary place". Bark also said the show made itself a [...] "target for charges of racism" [...] by making the three murderers black, but also credited the script with making one of the perpetrators so sympathetic. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said the writers [...] "try a little too hard" [...] to create sympathy for the three murder suspects, and the episode suffers due to the absence of actor Andre Braugher, who plays Detective Frank Pembleton. But Shales also praised Williams' performance and said the episode was particularly powerful because the actual violence is off-screen. Buzz McCain, columnist with The Washington Times, called the episode [...] "irritating" [...] and [...] "as pointless as the killing". He particularly criticized the script, which he said was clichéd and overly [...] "misty-eyed", particularly the extended moments of Williams talking about the shooting. In a later article, McCain said, [...] "Nothing I've written in this column generated as much visceral response as my nine paragraphs about ("Bop Gun")." [...] In addition to responses from angry fans, McCain received a call from David Mills, who McCain said [...] "simply <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> insight as to what specifically I didn't like about his show and how the writers might improve on the next one." ...|$|E

[...] She also added that ABC <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E

500|$|Ray Perkins {{replaced}} Leeman Bennett as {{the third}} head coach in Buccaneers history. Expectations had been that owner Hugh Culverhouse would hire popular ex-Tampa Bay Bandits coach Steve Spurrier, but Perkins was the only candidate interviewed. Perkins had been approached about the job two years earlier, but was not interested at the time. He was given the same title (Head Coach and Vice-President of Football Operations) as the previous two coaches. He brought along seven of his Alabama assistants: linebackers coach Sylvester Croom, assistant coach John Bobo, running backs coach Rodney Stokes, defensive line coach Mike DuBose, strength coach Kent Johnston, head trainer Chris Smith, and defensive coordinator Joe Kines, who had previously been Charley Pell's defensive coordinator with the Florida Gators. He rounded out his staff with Kansas City Chiefs secondary coach Doug Graber and receivers coach Richard Williamson, Buffalo Bills defensive coordinator Herb Paterra, SMU defensive coordinator Bill Clay, and Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach Larry Beightol. Perkins also overhauled the scouting staff, firing most of them (including Jim Gruden, father of future Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden) shortly after the draft. No reason was given, but some observers, most outspokenly Boston Globe columnist Will McDonough, felt that the Buccaneers' office was staffed heavily with people whose main experience was in college football, and that the team suffered {{from a lack of}} NFL knowledge. Recently fired Falcons coach Dan Henning turned down the offensive coordinator position, as he had been trying to rebuild the Falcons {{and did not want to}} relive that experience with another team. Perkins had previously been hired as head coach of the New York Giants on the basis of his experience working with a losing franchise (the New England Patriots) that needed turning around. Perkins coached the Giants back to the playoffs, leaving four years later to succeed coaching legend Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. Ironically, irritation over the 1982 players' strike was a major factor in Perkins' leaving the Giants, and became an issue he had to contend with again in 1987. Frustration with what he saw as overregulation by the NCAA played a part in Perkins' decision to return to the NFL. Along with $750,000 a year for five years, Perkins was given free rein to run the Buccaneers however he <b>wanted.</b> <b>Some</b> players were enthusiastic about the Perkins hire. [...] "Coach Perkins will bring in a sense of pride here, and that's something we've been missing", said tackle Ron Heller. Others were upset with Perkins' military-style manner, saying that he [...] "made playing football a miserable experience".|$|E
