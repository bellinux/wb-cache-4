500|$|In Inception, Nolan {{wanted to}} explore [...] "the idea of people sharing a dream space...That gives you the ability to access somebody's {{unconscious}} mind. What <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> used and abused for?" [...] The majority of the film's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always {{in a state of}} production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it. By contrast, the world of The Matrix (1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. Nolan's world has more in common with the works of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.|$|E
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? <b>Would</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E

He also indicated that the [...] "classic Doctor" [...] he would most like to feature in a new story was William Hartnell's First Doctor, stating, [...] "You'd want him to come and say 'What in the name of God have I turned into?' That's the confrontation that you most want to see, to celebrate 50 years. Going round and round in circles on it I just thought, 'What about a Doctor that he never talks about?' And what if it is a Doctor who's done something terrible, who's much deadlier and more serious, who represents that thing that is the undertow in both David and Matt. You know there's a terrible old man inside them. Well, here he is, facing the children he becomes, as it were." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract I aim to {{show that}} {{standard}} theories of counterfactuals are mistaken, not in detail, but in principle, and I aim to say what form a tenable theory must take. Standard theories entail a categorical interpretation of counterfactuals, on which to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> A, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state something, not relative to any supposition or hypothesis, but categorically. On the rival suppositional interpretation, to state <b>that,</b> if it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> A, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C <b>is</b> to state <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> C relative to the supposition <b>that</b> it <b>were</b> <b>that</b> A. The two interpretations make incompatible predictions concerning the correct evaluation of counterfactuals. I argue that the suppositional interpretation makes the correct prediction...|$|R
