Along {{with the}} people {{environmental}} protection consciousness enhancement, the enterprise and the family are inclined to use the green electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable to reduce the environmental pollution. This paper firstly introduces the concept of green electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable, and then expounds thecurrent situation of green electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable materials, finally gives the development tendency of green electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable materialsin order to provide references for the related researchers. Concept of Green Electric <b>Wire</b> <b>and</b> Cable The green electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable is also called environmental-friendly electric <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable, which is {{a new type of}} the <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable aggressively promoted in the world. It is characterized little environmental pollution and harm to human body in the product manufacturing and use. The main requirements of green environmental protection cable are no halogen, flame retardant, not produce toxic and corrosive gas, and not contain heavy metals, easy recycling. The main technical conditions for environmental protection type of <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> cable: Cable halogen containing heavy metals and harmful chemicals can cause the air, water and soil pollution, already is an indisputable fact.

USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> {{left the city}} almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E

5|$|In the Bahamas, wind gusts reached 110mph (170km/h) on Grand Bahama.

5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> are thus larger in diameter.|$|E

5|$|The initial coup was {{postponed}} to September 1, 1919. However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously– {{on the night}} of August 27 to 28. The Lithuanian intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did not know who and when. The Lithuanian government was informed about the cut telegraph <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, the government did not consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.|$|E

However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it was replaced with a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|E

5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E

Starting gates were tested during the second national team trials held at the lake on 27–28 June 2009. Temporary grandstands for 20,000 spectators per day were also constructed.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened as {{an upgrade}} of two {{existing}} suburban tramways, the Østensjø- and Lambertseter Lines. By 1970, {{the system was}} supplemented by the Grorud- and Furuset Lines. They only operated to the eastern suburbs. In 1987, the system was expanded to connect to the western network, that remained a suburban tramway with overhead wires, two-car platforms and an inferior signaling system. In 1993, the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard, with the Røa Line following two years later. When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed, the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used overhead <b>wires,</b> <b>and</b> {{would not be able}} to use the new stock. Both systems were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems, that would connect to the Lilleaker- and Ullevål Hageby Line, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E

For the initial assault on 12 October, Emden was tasked with bombarding a Russian gun emplacement at Pamerort; Heinrich was given command of the landings there. At 06:08, Emden opened fire on the gun battery. Her first two salvos fell short, but the third hit and disabled the telephone <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> speaking tubes, which rendered central control of the Russian guns impossible. By 07:00, the Russian guns were silenced and German troops began to go ashore unopposed. Two {{and a half hours}} later, a pair of Russian destroyers attempted to intervene, but Emden engaged them and drove them off.|$|E
