40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{previous}} study we demonstrated that mild metabolic alkalosis resulting from standard bicarbonate haemodialysis induces hypotension. In this study, we have further investigated the changes in systemic haemodynamics induced by bicarbonate and calcium, using non-invasive procedures. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial with a single-blind, crossover design, we sequentially changed the dialysate bicarbonate and calcium concentrations (between 26 and 35 mmol/l for bicarbonate and either 1. 25 or 1. 50 mmol/l for calcium). Twenty-one patients were enrolled {{for a total of}} 756 dialysis sessions. Systemic haemodynamics was evaluated using pulse <b>wave</b> <b>analysers.</b> Bioimpedance and BNP were used to compare the fluid status pattern. RESULTS: The haemodynamic parameters and the pre-dialysis BNP using either a high calcium or bicarbonate concentration were as follows: systolic blood pressure (+ 5. 6 and - 4. 7 mmHg; P < 0. 05 for both), stroke volume (+ 12. 3 and + 5. 2 ml; P < 0. 05 and ns), peripheral resistances (- 190 and - 171 dyne s cm(- 5); P < 0. 05 for both), central augmentation index (+ 1. 1 % and - 2. 9 %; ns and P < 0. 05) and BNP (- 5 and - 170 ng/l; ns and P < 0. 05). The need of staff intervention was similar in all modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Both high bicarbonate and calcium concentrations in the dialysate improve the haemodynamic pattern during dialysis. Bicarbonate reduces arterial stiffness and ameliorates the heart tolerance for volume overload in the interdialytic phase, whereas calcium directly increases stroke volume. The slight hypotensive effect of alkalaemia should motivate a probative reduction of bicarbonate concentration in dialysis fluid for haemodynamic reasons, only in the event of failure of classical tools to prevent intradialytic hypotension...|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} it has been {{apparent}} that a requirement in radioastronomy is a device capable of providing high time resolution polarization spectra of a wide bandwidth. This thesis describes such an instrument. The new polarimeter spectrometer is based on two surface acoustic <b>wave</b> (SAW) spectrum <b>analysers</b> operating in a coherent (phase preserving) mode. The method of spectrum analysis is a high sensitivity one, the analysers being more akin to filterbank types than to swept-frequency instruments. A wideband analog multiplier has been developed, permitting the spectrum analyser outputs to be correlated directly to yield cross-spectral or polarization data. As well, the usual problem with SAW analysers - the high output data rate - has been overcome {{with the development of}} a fast digital spectrum integrator. This device allows the SAW intermediate-frequency processor to be interfaced to a general purpose computer, resulting in a real-time signal processing system with great versatility. The prototype SAW processor produces polarization spectra over a bandwidth of about 30 MHz with frequency and time resolutions of 650 kHz and 2. 4 uS. When interfaced to a typical computer, Stokes polarization spectra with a time resolution of about 150 uS are available. After allowing for non-continuous operation of the prototype spectrum analysers, the radiometer efficiency of the complete processing system exceeds 70...|$|R

This final paper describes {{the influence of}} electromagnetic radiation of household appliances on the environment they operate in. It {{is important to know}} that every electrical device emits electromagnetic radiation, and if the level of that radiation is too high,it can greatly impact people’s health and a safe working environment of the device under testing. This phenomenon of excessive emission that would endanger everything around the device is called electromagnetic interference and it is the key phenomenon tested in this final paper. It was necessary to determine the emission level of the operating device and compare it with the emission level of the devicethat is switched off. This was done by using a spectrum analyser and a conical dipole antenna.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the developed instrumentation and measurement techniques {{suitable for use}} in a submillimetre wave compact antenna test range (CATR) for testing high-gain antennas and the quiet-zone quality of the CATR, but also {{for use in a}}ntenna testing with planar near-field scanning at submillimetre wavelengths. The thesis work is focused on improving the phase measurement accuracy and the dynamic range of a commercial submillimetre <b>wave</b> vector network <b>analyser.</b> The full angular scattering properties of radiation absorbing materials (RAM) suitable for the CATR are also analysed in the thesis. A CATR can be used for testing of electrically large antennas at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. These high-gain dish antennas are required for spaceborne astronomy and limb sounding of the Earth atmosphere. The most common CATR configuration at millimetre waves uses a reflector as the collimating element. However, the surface accuracy requirement of the reflector becomes very stringent at frequencies over 200  GHz, and the manufacturing of the reflector thus very expensive. An alternative collimator to the reflector is the binary amplitude hologram which is studied in this thesis. The hologram is a planar transmission type device, which is realised as a slot pattern on a metallised dielectric film. The surface (pattern) accuracy requirement of the hologram is less stringent than that of a reflector and it is potentially of lower cost. The amplitude and phase ripples of the CATR quiet-zone field need to be below ±  0. 5  dB and ±  5 °. The hologram CATR operating at 310  GHz discussed in this thesis is shown to be able to achieve these limits even at submillimetre wavelengths. The amplitude and phase measurement accuracies of a vector network analyser largely depend on the strength of the detected signal. The quiet-zone tests of planned large hologram CATRs require larger dynamic range than is possible with the standard solid-state source configuration, so a phase-lock system for submillimetre wave backward-wave oscillators (BWO) had to be developed. The powerful phase-locked BWO source described in this thesis can improve the dynamic range and the accuracy of the measurement system considerably. The improvement in dynamic range over the standard source based on a frequency-multiplied Gunn oscillator is 16 - 40  dB over the frequency range of 300 - 700  GHz. Problems in the phase measurement accuracy arise when the receiver is moved across the quiet-zone area with microwave cables connected to it. The flexing of the cables causes phase errors reaching tens of degrees due to changes in their electrical lengths. The novel phase error measurement and correction system described in this thesis is based on the use of a pilot signal to track changes in the electrical length of a microwave cable. The error analysis shows that phase correction of the detected submillimetre wave signal is possible down to a level of 2 ° with the constructed system. Accurate operation has also been verified by measurements. The CATR facility needs large quantities of high-performance absorbers. In order to select suitable absorbers, the specular and non-specular reflectivities of several commercially available, state-of-the art absorber materials have been measured between 200 - 600  GHz. Selected wool and synthetic floor carpet materials were also included in the tests. The results show that specular reflectivities between − 40 …− 50  dB are possible over a considerable angular range when the materials are oriented properly. The best floor carpet materials have reflectivities below − 15  dB over a wide angular range and are useful in the less critical areas by reducing backscatter. The published report is the first in the open literature showing the full angular performance of these materials across a wide frequency range. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} change in ocular aberrations after {{wavefront}} optimized (WFO) laser in situ keratomileusis (Lasik) for correction of myopia and to analyze causative factors that may influence them. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective case series. WFO Lasik was performed for the correction of myopia, using the hansatome (Bausch and Lomb) microkeratome to create the flap and the Allegretto laser (Wavelight Technologie) to perform the ablation. The Allegretto <b>wave</b> <b>analyser</b> (Tscherning-type) measured the ocular aberrations prior to Lasik, one month and six months postoperatively. Results: The {{mean age of the}} 59 patients included in the study was 25 &# 177; 5. 64 years and the mean spherical equivalent of the 117 eyes that underwent Lasik 0 was - 5. 33 &# 177; 1. 22 preoperatively and - 0. 21 &# 177; 0. 38 postoperatively. Hundred and two eyes of 117 (87 &#x 0025;) achieved uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20 / 20 or better after WFO Lasik and 104 of 117 eyes (89 &#x 0025;) were within &# 177; 0. 5 D of the attempted refractive correction. There was a 1. 96 -fold increase in total root-mean-square of higher order aberrations. Induced changes in seven of the 22 higher order Zernike terms showed a significant linear correlation with the refractive correction attempted. Larger ablation zones induced less spherical aberration. Conclusion: In spite of an excellent visual outcome, WFO Lasik induces significant higher order aberrations. Large ablation zones reduce the induction of spherical aberration...|$|E
40|$|Observations of long-period ocean waves {{have been}} carried out at Miyagi-Enoshima on the {{north-eastern}} coast of Japan for a long time. For tsunami study, however, it is necessary to have observation points similar to Enoshima at several places in the Pacific coast of Japan, and as a realization of this plan, the Izu-Oshima Tsunami Observatory was established in September 1960. This observatory stands at Senzu, the north-eastern part of Oshima, a volcanic island situated on the Izu-Marianne ridge which separates the Philippine Sea from the Pacific Ocean. The observatory is therefore situated at a favorable position to record tsunamis originating both from the NE and SW parts of Honshu Island of Japan. The observatory includes an observation house made of concrete blocks and a gauge well built on lava of Mt. Mihara projecting into the sea. In the observatory are installed the ERI-IV tsunami recorder, a microbarograph and a microseismograph, as shown in Table 1. Tsunamis have not yet been observed, but spectra of records in different meteorological conditions were obtained to investigate the features of the background noise constantly observable in the records of the tsunami recorder. The spectral analyses were made by the <b>wave</b> <b>analyser</b> specially constructed for studies of the tsunami spectra. The following features were known by the present spectral analyses. 1. When typhoon 6124 approached Oshima island and sea and swell became heavy, the tsunami recorder recorded prominently 1 to 2 minute waves. As heights of this 1 - 2 minute waves have a good correlation with wind velocities, they may be the "surf beat" named by Munk. 2. The spectra of the records were obtained for the following four cases. (1) Oct. 8 - 9, 1961, when typhoon 6124 was approaching. (2) May 14 - 15, 1961, when a small depression was passing along the southern coast of Honshu Island. (3) Dec. 25 - 26, 1961, when a monsoon wind was blowing. (4) May 4 - 5, 1961, when a depression was passing through the Japan sea. In the first and second cases when wind waves were very rough off the coast of Senzu, the parts of the spectrum of the period shorter than 12 to 18 minutes are about twice as large as the parts of longer period. On the other hand, in the third and fourth cases when the sea off the coast of Senzu was rather calm, the spectra are flat extending over the whole period band. Therefore, it is supposed that the short period components of spectra relate to the activity of the sea just adjoining the coast. In the latter two cases, another remarkable fact is that the sea level fluctuations of the period longer than 60 minutes increased later to the greatest energy. 3. The predominant period of 11 to 12 minutes was recorded in each spectrum, which may be explained as being due to the island seich of this island. 4. In every case stated above, there is a striking fact that all spectra have a minimum at about 40 minutes in period. If we assume the mouth of Sagami Bay to be the line connecting Oshima and Boso peninsula, the natural period of the bay will be 38 minutes. The fact that a spectrum of the tide gauge record at Ito on the coast of Sagami Bay shows a peak of 42 minutes will be in favor of this assumption. If there is such a resonator it is only reasonable that the amplitude of the sea level fluctuations near Oshima is attenuated at the period of the free oscillation of Sagami Bay. The minimum point of the spectrum mentioned above {{may be the result of}} this effect. 5. A spectrum of the microbarograph record obtained at Oshima is hardly similar to that of the tsunami recorder, even when the microbarograph has recorded fair and regular waves. This fact shows that the long-period sea level fluctuations have little relation with the microbarometric disturbances at this island...|$|E
