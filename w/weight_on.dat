5|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can be greatly reduced by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> land.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E

5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> {{trying to convey}} a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|The Caio Duilio {{class was}} a pair of ironclad turret ships built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1870s and 1880s. They were fitted with the largest guns available, 17.72in (450mm) rifled muzzle-loading guns, and were the largest, fastest and most {{powerful}} ships of their day. To save <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> such large vessels, the ship's designer, Benedetto Brin adopted a radical solution for the time: he reserved armor only for the central portion of the ship where it protected the ships' engines and ammunition magazines, {{while the rest of the}} hull were extensively sub-divided with watertight compartments.|$|E
5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E

5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines {{that put a}} greater <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. The 9th ICTV Report defines {{the concept of the}} virus species as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. However, at present {{only a small part of}} the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} – the latent period between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body <b>weight).</b> <b>On</b> average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} set in a shed {{enclosed}} by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like grisaille.

On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of Cain and Abel: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod.|$|E

5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E
5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> snow as efficiently. The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
