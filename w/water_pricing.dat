25|$|National <b>Water</b> <b>Pricing</b> Policy. In 1985 the {{government}} adopted a National <b>Water</b> <b>Pricing</b> Policy {{with the objective}} to gradually reach full operation and maintenance cost recovery for water by 1991. The policy also introduced a sewer surcharge set at just 10% of the water bill.

40|$|In {{light of}} the actual {{economic}} circumstances and <b>water</b> <b>price</b> level, the CGE model to simulate the price policy for multiple water sources is modified and expanded. A <b>water</b> <b>price</b> reform plan is proposed to meet water-saving requirements and water resources allocation. The affected scale and scope for implementing the <b>water</b> <b>price</b> policy is evaluated on a quantitative basis. Research results indicate that a reasonable <b>water</b> <b>price</b> system in Tianjin in 2020 should be set up as follows: the comprehensive tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> stands at 4 $/m 3, the tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> for industrial, administrative and business service sectors is 2. 4 $/m 3, and the tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> for special industry and domestic use are 8. 8 $/m 3 and 1. 4 $/m 3 respectively. The adjusted <b>water</b> <b>price</b> will bring about tangible results to water resources allocation optimization and water conservation. Although most sectors are negatively affected to varying degrees after raising the <b>water</b> <b>price,</b> particularly the lodging and catering sectors, a 100 % <b>water</b> <b>price</b> rising will produce only little impact on price index, and sectoral output and employment will not cause economic fluctuations or social instability. <b>Water</b> <b>price</b> adjustments, {{as long as it}} is reasonable, will be more positive than negative on the whole.

Because of this, the government only charges them a nominal price, in case the farmers give up growing crops, and this in turn threatens food safety (Nickum 1998). <b>Water</b> <b>prices</b> vary from one village to another, or may only be charged in specific crop planting areas, which means it is hard to estimate the average provincial <b>water</b> <b>price</b> directly. Agricultural CPI is an objective reflection of the cost of crop production and reflects structural changes. Therefore, we use agricultural CPI to represent the cost of crop production.|$|R

However this committee was only formally established in November 1994, a result of a deliberate effort by the state técnicos (technical staff) to mobilize the municipal government and, especially, civil society. Its functions include setting guidelines and approving river basin plans; proposing pricing criteria and values for bulk <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> and a program for allocating proceeds derived from such water charges; integrating the decision-making and programs of water-related institutions working in the basin; and other responsibilities. The 48 seats of the committee's assembly are divided equally among representatives of three sectors: municipal government, state government agencies (including public water users), and organized civil society groups (including those representing private water users). Local issues are decided in the five sub-committees created after 1997.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the important issue of transboundary sharing of fresh surface water resources, including {{quantity and quality}} dimensions. It carves a simple economic model of the benefits which can be generated by maximizing the joint profits earned, when the resource is shared efficiently between two countries. The appropriate policy instrument towards this end is a bilateral agreement to charge the same <b>water</b> <b>price</b> to all <b>water</b> users in a given sector. Market clearance will then follow to determine the optimal <b>water</b> <b>price.</b> The case of the Nestos river flowing through Bulgaria and Greece, but overexploited by Bulgaria, in the Balkans {{is used as a}} case study. The empirical estimation of a fixed proportions production function for corn derives a marginal water value of the Nestos water for Greece.

For example, Clark County, Nevada, raised its water rates in 2008 to encourage conservation.

40|$|Significant {{attention}} has been given to the improvement of environmental flows in recent years. An important factor to reduce the opportunity cost of flood creation needed for the environment is the access to storage capacity. Reallocating storage capacity from agriculture to environment, however, may have important impacts on irrigation <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> and the vitality of irrigation enterprises. In this paper, the long term impacts of storage capacity reallocation on the agricultural sector are analysed. It is shown that a reduction in storage capacity for irrigation water will reduce <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> for each level of dam content and shift the distribution of dam content to the left. As a result, the value of the irrigation sector is reduced.
