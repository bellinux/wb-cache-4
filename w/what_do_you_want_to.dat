500|$|Characters on Animaniacs had catchphrases, {{with some}} {{characters}} {{having more than}} one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's [...] "Goodnight, everybody!" [...] often said following adult humor, Wakko's [...] "Faboo!" [...] and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" [...] and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode [...] "Win Big," [...] and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets IV is the {{grandson}} of Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., the pilot of the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You seem to be very interested in serving – <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and he told me to look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E
2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do?' and I said, 'Well, I {{think it might be}} best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

[...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material.

Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve.
