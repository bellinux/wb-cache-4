2500|$|Jim Thorpe's life touched Bascom. [...] "I {{felt like}} I had walked in his boots," [...] Earl said. [...] "Like Jim Thorpe, cowboy {{life was the}} only life that I knew. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> art, what about art school?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, One Life to Live {{executive}} producer Linda Gottlieb hired a fresh-faced 17-year-old Ryan Phillippe {{to play the}} newly created role. Phillippe said he was warned against playing the [...] "risky" [...] role {{at the height of}} the AIDS crisis in the United States. Phillippe said that when he auditioned to play the character, he [...] "had no idea Billy was gay." [...] He initially expressed reservation to pursue the opportunity, telling Entertainment Weekly in 1992, [...] "I thought, 'What is my family going to think? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> friends?' But I realized that for [...] Billy, the torment is a hundred times that." ...|$|E

One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, the other," [...] she repeated. [...] "Then, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> thoughts? Luckily we have Mr. d'Alcacer. I shall {{speak to}} him first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fourteen--is {{that very}} old? Ah, fool, {{to tell my}} age truly--no woman does that. Why did I not say thirteen? And I have been married six months, such a long time! I am sure I have green, blue, yellow, grey hairs coming out all over my head by this time. And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hair, sir, you never spoke of that? Did I not let it down for you? Is it not soft and beautiful? Tell me, sir, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{away the}} bats and things, and mind <b>what</b> you are <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> hearties. No {{fighting}} allowed aboard this ship," [...] said Emil, who rather lorded {{it over the}} others.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say <b>what</b> {{you like}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> intellect," [...] replied the dutiful son, [...] "but I can't think of even one--not {{even a small}} one. Not--Good gracious! You don't mean--you can't mean--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t know <b>what</b> she’ll talk <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> dear Jackson, but she’ll think; and her {{thoughts}} won’t be pleasant—I mean for others. Do {{you expect to}} sink her to your own rank?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he doesn't I won't be very grieved. Throwing forty-foot rails {{about all}} day palls on one. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wages up to date?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{body would}} {{think there was}} {{something}} in this," [...] said the missionary. [...] "But if these tales are true, I wonder <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> tales!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sooner or later! That's {{all very}} fine, but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> canvas sling?--he's carried it off. I want it now, at once, to land two Celebes cows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sholto, you hit us {{all very}} hard that Monday before Christmas. I know <b>what</b> I felt <b>about</b> <b>my</b> daughter. But I {{can only imagine}} what your mother must have felt about her son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And as to <b>what</b> you say <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{seat at the}} board, Sir Gregory, you may {{probably}} be right. Perhaps it will be as well that I should see the Chancellor of the Exchequer myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got to be}} a {{very great}} man, you know," [...] she said to {{him in the middle of}} the lake. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> you mean <b>about</b> <b>my</b> salon, but I am ambitious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my boy," [...] {{replied the}} man, [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> dog?" [...] and, {{as he said}} this, {{he looked down at}} the dog, which was lying upon the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> bill?" [...] {{asked the}} storekeeper, anxiously. He was {{interested}} in but little outside of his business. [...] "Of course that {{has got to be}} settled before you leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|LIEUTENANT. My promise! I didn't mean to promise. Look here: you're {{as bad as}} he is: you've {{taken an}} {{advantage}} of me through the better side of my nature. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> horse? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{happened}} to you?" [...] said I again, for I {{wanted to know}} <b>what</b> she thought <b>about</b> <b>my</b> sudden appearance. It took some little {{time for her to}} get ready to answer, and then she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr Barry, what is it?" [...] {{said the}} other, returning. Lynch paused, and evidently {{did not know}} whether to speak or let it alone. At last he said, [...] "Never mind--I'll get {{somebody}} else to say what I was going to say. But you'd better look sharp <b>what</b> you're <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> lad, or you'll find yourself in a scrape that you don't dream of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope she'll {{look after}} her money, that's all. And <b>what's</b> all this <b>about</b> <b>my</b> friend Rachel? I'd a great deal sooner hear {{that she was going}} to be married,--if I knew that the man was worthy of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{everybody}} concerned is happy," [...] said Pauline. [...] "Ada {{is going}} to college and so am I, and Aunt Olivia is on the same committee as Mrs. Knowles for the big church bazaar. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> 'low tastes' now, Aunt Olivia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{week-end}} on the river?" [...] she exclaimed, as {{they shook}} hands. [...] "Isn't it delightful? I have ordered lunch early--do you mind?--and I thought, if you felt energetic, it's not too cold {{for you to}} take me out on the river; or, if you feel lazy, I'll take you." ...|$|E
60|$|Is that so? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> Lady of the Shroud? I {{must not}} think of that or of her in this gallery. Love and war are separate, and may not mix--cannot mix, {{if it comes to}} that. I must be wise in the matter; and if I have got the hump in any degree whatever, must not show it.|$|E
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Pettikins, don't make me cry. You know <b>what</b> {{you said}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> making a {{household}} pet {{of him is}} a little true. Perhaps {{he ought to have}} waited for you. Would any other woman on earth forgive you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sarah, my dear,' {{returned}} her brother, 'thank you. But I know <b>what</b> I am <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> love, {{and will take}} the liberty of expressing myself accordingly. Mr Witherden, Sir, your handkerchief is hanging out of your pocket--would you allow me to--, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} sharply, for Miss Layard did not shine at Tennis. [...] "I dislike women who go <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> brother calls 'pot-hunting' {{just as if}} they were professionals." ...|$|R
6000|$|PEW. I don't; so bear a hand. (Exit MRS. DRAKE; PEW empties the glass.) Rum, ah, rum, you're {{a lovely}} creature; they haven't never done you justice. (Proceeds to fill and light pipe; {{re-enter}} MRS. DRAKE with rum.) And now, ma'am, since you're so genteel and amicable-like, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> old commander? Is he, {{in a manner}} of speaking, on half pay? or is he living on his fortune, like a gentleman slaver ought? ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{imagined}} himself accosting the red-nosed {{student and}} suddenly shaking his fist in his face. [...] "From that one, though," [...] he reflected, [...] "there's {{nothing to be}} got, because he has no mind of his own. He's living in a red democratic trance. Ah! you want to smash your way into universal happiness, my boy. I will give you universal happiness, you silly, hypnotized ghoul, you! And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own happiness, eh? Haven't I got any right to it, just because I can think for myself?..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You used to {{play with}} that when my sister brought you down here after your measles,' said Rhoda as he slipped the money into his pocket. 'Now, this was your pore dear auntie's business-room.' She opened a low door. 'Oh, I forgot about Mr. Sidney! There he is.' An {{enormous}} old man with rheumy red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an Empire chair, his cap in his hands. Rhoda withdrew sniffing. The man looked Midmore over in silence, then jerked a thumb towards the door. 'I reckon she told you who I be,' he began. 'I'm the only farmer you've got. Nothin' goes off my place 'thout it walks on its own feet. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> pig-pound?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I ask, sir, why I {{should care}} about {{a father and}} mother who deserted me? Mind <b>what</b> you are <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> lady!" [...] he cried--suddenly {{addressing}} my aunt. [...] "There's a cat {{in the folds of}} that curtain; she might frighten you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is just <b>what</b> {{everyone}} says <b>about</b> <b>my</b> sugar taffy. Nobody up our way can match it, though goodness knows they try hard enough. My great-grandmother invented the recipe herself, {{and it has}} been in our family ever since. I'm real glad you liked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know {{everything}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> poor brother's done, Mr. Trumbull," [...] said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while she turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull's ear.|$|R
