5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren {{and joined the}} Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E
5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope {{through a hole in the}} dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

25|$|<b>Wake</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> Wogan {{attracted}} {{an audience}} of eight million in 2005.

According to figures leaked to British newspapers in April 2006, Wogan was the highest paid BBC radio presenter at that time, with an Â£800,000 a year salary. In an interview with Britain's Hello magazine in its 30 May 2006 issue, Wogan confirmed this, saying that he represented good value.

500|$|... "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] is {{the fourteenth}} {{episode of the}} second season of the {{television}} series Glee, and the thirty-sixth overall. The episode was written by Ian Brennan, directed by Eric Stoltz and first aired in the United States on Fox on February 22, 2011. This episode mainly centers {{on the issues of}} underage drinking, as the students of McKinley High School are coming drunk to school in increasing numbers. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) plans an assembly to warn the students about the dangers on underage drinking, and asks glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to have his students perform a song that send positive messages about avoiding alcohol. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) throws a party for the glee club students where almost everyone gets drunk; the partygoers <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> hangovers, and must perform various songs about alcohol while still under the influence. The assembly ends abruptly when a song that seems to glorify alcohol is interrupted by two of the singers vomiting over the others, which scares the entire high school into avoiding drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{around the}} world sought to {{interpret}} {{the relationship between the}} Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutalâtraits only amplified by their machineryâwhile the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the Avatar hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews." [...] Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying [...] "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature." [...] Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged [...] "every man, woman and child" [...] to see the film and <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is [...] "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as [...] "the only... promise of survival" [...] for humanity. [...] Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, [...] "With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life." [...] Cameron confirmed that [...] "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club {{is a metaphor for}} the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and successâlike these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E
