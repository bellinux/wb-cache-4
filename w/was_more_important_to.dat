5|$|The left-wing preoccupations {{were also}} an {{important}} feature of Libertatea. Its opening manifesto called for a large-scale social reform, which it claimed <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> put faith into practice helping others so he left preaching to study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, {{he was not sure}} what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

40|$|From the {{evolutionary}} perspective, friends help us solve the adaptive problems of reproduction, our own survival, and survival of our offspring. Opposite-sex friendships (OSFs) provide {{individuals with a}} wider net of quality friends, potential mates, and protectors, with sex differences originating in parental investment differences: in OSFs men pursue sexual access, while females seek physical protection and long-term mate potential. We investigated the relationship of sex, gender roles, sociosexuality (SOI), and romantic involvement with the reasons for OSFs initiation and dissolution {{in a sample of}} 94 female and 90 male heterosexual students of Zagreb University. Initiation of OSF because of sexual attraction and availability <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> men and participants with higher SOI, while friendship dissolution for the same reason <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> those with higher SOI, masculinity, and femininity. Initiation of OSF because of physical protection <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> women and participants with higher femininity, and dissolution for the same reason <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> women; OSF initiation because of romantic relationship potential <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> men. These findings can be explained by sex differences in long-term mating strategies, rendering the reasons for initiation of OSFs similar to those for engaging in long-term romantic relationships...|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} period of German naval expansion, Britain {{did not feel}} {{particularly}} threatened. The Lords of the Admiralty felt {{the implications of the}} Second Naval Law were not a significantly more dangerous threat than the fleet set by the First Naval Law; they believed it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> focus on the practical situation rather than speculation on future programs that might easily be reduced or cut entirely. Segments of the British public, however, quickly seized on the perceived threat posed by the German construction programs. Despite their dismissive reaction, the Admiralty resolved to surpass German battleship construction. Admiral John Fisher, who became the First Sea Lord and head of the Admiralty in 1904, introduced sweeping reforms in large part to counter the growing threat posed by the expanding German fleet. Training programs were modernized, old and obsolete vessels were discarded, and the scattered squadrons of battleships were consolidated into four main fleets, three of which were based in Europe. Britain also made a series of diplomatic arrangements, including an alliance with Japan that allowed a greater concentration of British battleships in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E

25|$|In {{the science}} of the day, the {{prevailing}} view was that everything of value could be studied in a laboratory.

25|$|To refill his {{depleted}} forces, Tabinshwehti immediately {{ordered his}} vassals {{to raise more}} men, and send more provisions. But {{there was not enough}} time. The Toungoo command was split as to what to do next. One faction led by Gen. Nanda Thingyan recommended lifting the siege, reasoning that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> defend the delta. But others including Bayinnaung disliked an outright lifting of the siege because Prome's forces, they feared, could join in on an attack from the north. In the end, they settled on the proposal by Thiri Zeya Kyawhtin: (1) continue the appearance of a siege with a minimal force, (2) meet the enemy on both fronts, (3) if either front fails, lift the siege and defend the homeland, and (4) resume the siege if the Arakanese were defeated.|$|E

25|$|By October 1919, the {{government}} was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich's troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> defend Moscow, Petrograd {{would have to be}} abandoned. Trotsky argued that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By 22 October the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November, Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions in Petrograd.|$|E

25|$|Al-Arsuzi's central {{thought was}} the {{unification}} of the Arab Nation. He believed that the Arab Nation could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The historical link to an Arab Nation <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> al-Arsuzi {{than it was to}} other Arab nationalists and Ba'athists. The only way to create a new Arab Nation in the Modern Age was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language—the only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the Arab Nation) and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non–Arabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics—these laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.|$|E
25|$|While {{the right}} wing of the Army of the Moselle {{advanced}} to Speyer, the left wing under Jean René Moreaux occupied Kaiserslautern on 1 January 1794. The French pursued as far north as Bad Kreuznach before encountering Prussian resistance and falling back to Kaiserslautern. On 18 January the Coalition garrison withdrew from Fort-Louis and blew up the fortifications. On 14 January Pichegru was relieved in command of the Army of the Rhine by Claude Ignace François Michaud. This ended the constant bickering that had sprung up between him and Hoche. The Prussians were not fully committed to the war because their leaders were divided over whether it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> crush the French Revolution or participate in the Third Partition of Poland. As it was, Prussia wished to leave the Coalition at the end of 1793, but kept fighting in 1794 when the United Kingdom paid to keep 60,000 of its troops in the field. Fed up with interference from King Frederick William II, who was more interested in Poland, Brunswick resigned command of the army.|$|E
25|$|Major-General Oliver Nugent, the {{commander}} of the 36th Division, had used information from captured German orders and noted that German artillery could not bombard advancing British troops since German positions were distributed in depth and the forward zone was easily penetrated. The advance of supporting troops was much easier to obstruct but it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> help the foremost infantry. If counter-battery fire was insufficient, the covering fire in front of the advance was more important and counter-battery groups should change target. Nugent recommended that fewer field guns be used for the creeping barrage and that surplus guns should be grouped to fire sweeping barrages (from side-to-side) and that Shrapnel shells should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes. Creeping barrages should be slower with more frequent and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and 60-pounder guns should sweep and search (move side-to-side and back-and-forth). Nugent suggested that infantry formations should change from skirmish lines to mobile company columns on narrow fronts, equipped with a machine-gun and Stokes mortar and move within a zone, since lines broke up under machine-gun fire in crater-fields and became disorganised.|$|E
