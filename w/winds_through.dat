5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> the Black Forest. The Elz {{creates a}} series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E
5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through this stretch the highway <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E

5|$|Green Creek rises near Waller {{and heads}} roughly south to Rohrsburg {{and on to}} Orangeville, where it joins Fishing Creek. It drains {{the central part of}} the Fishing Creek watershed. Little Fishing Creek starts just in Lycoming County near the Columbia County Line. It <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> rural areas before {{reaching}} Pennsylvania Route 42, which it runs parallel to for the remainder of its length. It drains the western part of the Fishing Creek watershed. Four covered bridges cross Little Fishing Creek; these are the Wanich Covered Bridge No. 69, the Sam Eckman Covered Bridge No. 92, the Jud Christie Covered Bridge No. 95, and the Creasyville Covered Bridge.|$|E
5|$|State Route 133, locally called Laguna Canyon Road, <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> Laguna Canyon for {{the entire}} length of the gorge. California State Route 73 bisects the gorge east-west. The lower section of the canyon is part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness, while the upper section also has a few smaller {{wilderness}} preserves. The upper section contains the Laguna Lakes, a series of small natural lakes formed by groundwater rising along a local fault line, which are the namesake of the canyon. A section of the lower canyon within the city limits of Laguna Beach is heavily developed. The northernmost extreme of the canyon lies near a residential area that adjoins Interstate 405.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles {{upstream}} from its mouth. At this point it passes through the largest freshwater marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek from the right. Darby Creek <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> a large lagoon 30ft deep in places that was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, from the right and turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E

5|$|US-59's first highway {{junction}} in Sequoyah County is with SH-141 west of Gans, {{where the}} latter highway reaches its western terminus. US-59 continues northward, crossing Wildhorse Mountain {{as well as}} Little Sallisaw Creek, just upstream of where it empties into Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The highway then enters the county seat of Sequoyah County, Sallisaw, where it has an interchange with Interstate 40 at Exit 308. North of the interstate, US-59 intersects US-64, turning east to follow the latter route into downtown Sallisaw. US-59 splits away to the north, becoming a two-lane highway. North of town, the highway serves as the western terminus of SH-101. US-59 then passes through unincorporated Brushy. North of Brushy, the highway <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> the Brushy Mountains. The road exits Sequoyah County north of this group of mountains.|$|E
5|$|A compact cyclone, Fred quickly {{reached its}} peak {{strength}} as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg) and 85mph (140km/h) <b>winds.</b> <b>Through</b> the rest of August31, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of São Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Antão over the next 12hours. On September1, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September14, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.|$|E
5|$|Elsa {{plans to}} give Anna a {{surprise}} birthday party {{with the help}} of Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf; but while Anna is led on a party treasure hunt by a string that <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> the kingdom, Elsa has caught a cold, and unknowingly produces a group of small living snowmen with each sneeze, who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff tries to stop them. While Elsa takes Anna on the hunt, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf try to control the snowmen and fix the decorations in time for Anna and Elsa's return. After Elsa nearly falls off a clock tower, Anna convinces her to take rest. While Anna enjoys the party, Elsa sneezes a giant snowball through an alphorn, inadvertently stunning Hans overseas; whereupon Elsa rests in bed under Anna's care. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the small snowmen to Elsa's ice palace, where they stay with her snow-giant doorkeeper Marshmallow.|$|E

5|$|Later on November30, the {{depression}} further intensified into a tropical cyclone {{and was given}} the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around {{the center for the}} system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65km/h (40mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg). Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November30. The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December1. However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> December2, by which time it was situated about 70km (45mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Within the village, {{the route}} gains the West Main Street moniker and heads through {{a mix of}} {{residential}} and commercial areas. NY221 crosses intersections with CR134A and CR134B and passes the former Marathon railroad depot before crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and the Tioughnioga River {{in the center of}} the community. After crossing the river, the renamed Main Street heads northeast through the village, intersecting with US11 (Cortland Street) just ahead of an interchange with Interstate81 (I-81) at the latter's exit9. After the exit from I-81, NY221 reenters another rural area and turns eastward past Dean Pond. After intersecting with CR161B (Texas Valley Road) and CR161C (Merrill Creek Road), NY221 crosses Merrill Creek and <b>winds</b> <b>through</b> farmland. Entering the town of Willet, NY221 crosses the southern terminus of CR167 (Bloody Pond Road) and makes a gradual curve to the north while intersecting with CR169 (Landers Corners Road). NY221 continues north to the hamlet of Willet, where it ends at an intersection with NY26 and NY41.|$|E
