5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> simple activities for children as they play the video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E
5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler <b>will</b> <b>explore</b> freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
