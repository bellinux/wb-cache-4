25|$|In Kyrgyzstan, {{transhumance}} practices, {{which never}} died {{out during the}} Soviet period, have undergone a resurgence in the difficult economic times following independence in 1991. Transhumance is integral to Kyrgyz national culture. The people use a <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> tent, known as the yurt or jailoo, while living on these summer pastures. It is symbolised on their national flag. Those shepherds prize a fermented drink made from mare's milk, known as the kumis. A tool used in its production is the namesake for Bishkek, the country's capital city.|$|E
500|$|Bethlehem {{work was}} unique {{in its use}} of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, <b>wool,</b> <b>felt</b> or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral {{patterns}} with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for [...] "royal" [...] wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.|$|E
40|$|<b>Felting</b> of <b>wool</b> is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a household tumble dryer were developed for testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Results with the loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. Loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), crimp frequency (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). Loose wool bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage. Loose wool feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained. Part of this is probably due to variation in yarn characteristics and {{there is a need for}} a method of producing short-lengths of yarn of constant structure from very small wool samples. The sire effect was significant (P< 0. 05) and controlled 6. 5 % of the variation in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and 12 % in yarn shrinkage. This indicates that selection for either increased or decreased loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage would induce changes in a flock. Further investigation into the effect of scale height is warranted to enhance understanding of variation in felting...|$|R
50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover cloth diapers. Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. <b>Wool</b> <b>felted</b> and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use <b>felted</b> <b>wool</b> fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.|$|R

40|$|Scouring of {{raw wool}} is a {{chemical}} treatment that needs a high amount of detergents, alkalis and water. Effluents produced by this treatment are extremely polluted with chemicals and impurities washed {{out from the}} fibers. It {{is well known that}} the ultrasound washing can remove effectively different substances from the textile surfaces even without surfactants due to the cavitations occurring at certain parameters of the ultrasound field. On the other side water treatments of wool combined with mechanical agitation provoked felting which can impair the quality of <b>wool</b> materials. <b>Felting</b> itself depends not only on the parameters of water treatments but also on the structure of wool cuticle. Partial hydrolysis of the cuticle with some proteases can decrease considerably the <b>wool</b> <b>felting.</b> The aim of this work is to study the possibility of applying the ultrasound at the process of raw wool scouring and the influence of proteases on the <b>felting</b> properties of <b>wool</b> at these conditions. It has been found out that ultrasound environment applied does not impair the specific activity of enzyme auxiliaries used and leads to increasing of their effect on the surface of wool fibers.

Ultrasonic wool scouring could be an alternative technology to minimise the negative impact, provided that the cleaning efficiency and fibre quality are not compromised. This study examined the influence of ultrasonic irradiation frequency and ultrasonic power variations on wool scouring performance at different liquor ratios.

Fibre surface damage was also assessed in this work. It was observed that while {{there was no significant}} influence of ultrasonic frequency on the whiteness or yellowness of the scoured fibres, wool scoured at frequencies of 28 kHz and 80 kHz had more grease and dirt removed than that scoured at 45 kHz. Low ultrasonic power and degassed bath liquor increased wool grease removal ability. Ultrasonic treatment caused scale cracking/peeling in some wool fibres. More severe cuticle damage was observed in fibres scoured at the lower frequency. This damage resulted in increased dye uptake by the fibres...|$|R
