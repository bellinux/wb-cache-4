500|$|Due {{to budget}} constraints, the Parks and Recreation set {{department}} did not build the harvest festival and corn maze sets, but instead filmed the episode {{at the annual}} Halloween Harvest Festival at Los Angeles Pierce College, a community college in California. Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival {{at the end of}} the episode was the most expensive in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, [...] "the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now". [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] was screened for members of the media during a January 2011 NBC press junket. Afterward, the reporters were taken to the set of Parks and Recreation where they were able to greet and pose for photos with the actual miniature horse who played Li'l Sebastian.

500|$|Before the {{formation}} lap, Rosberg {{appeared to have}} an issue with his car, when {{he stopped at the}} end of pit lane {{on the way to the}} start grid. However, his mechanics were able to rectify the problem, described by Niki Lauda as [...] "a glitch", and he made it to the grid. With everyone starting on the super-soft tyre compound, a race with two pit stops was expected for most drivers. At the start, all drivers at the front of the field held their positions, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg, who had a good start, and Sergio Pérez nearly collided while fighting for position. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso STR10 stalled on the grid and was pushed back to the pit lane, only to start his race shortly after, more than one lap down on the leaders. Vettel was able to build a gap to Ricciardo behind him quickly, leading the Red Bull by three seconds after the first lap. Fernando Alonso, who had enjoyed a decent start to move up into eleventh, came under pressure from Sainz by lap four, followed by Grosjean, who lost places at the start because he had to move around the stationary Verstappen. While Vettel's lead <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>five</b> seconds on lap five, Verstappen unlapped himself by lap six and posted fast lap times. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg held off the two Williams cars of Bottas and Massa, while Lewis Hamilton in front was able to move clear of the pack fighting for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen in third place was held at a distance by Ricciardo, trailing him by 1.6 seconds on lap nine. A lap later, Grosjean became the first driver to pit. More cars came in on lap eleven, leading to heavy traffic that prevented Sainz and Alonso from leaving their pit boxes, costing time. Alonso emerged from pit lane ahead of Grosjean, who moved past him into thirteenth. Felipe Massa had a slow stop of 4.8 seconds when he made a pit stop at the end of lap 13. When he emerged from pit lane, Nico Hülkenberg was approaching on the racing line. Both drivers collided, with Hülkenberg being catapulted off Massa's front right tyre, causing him to retire from the race. A Virtual Safety Car period ensued, that saw all drivers pit that had not done so before. Since Kvyat had made a pit stop shortly before the safety car was deployed, both Mercedes cars were able to move in front of him, leaving Kvyat in sixth place. Jenson Button's stop took a long time, dropping him to 16th place. By lap 16, the virtual was replaced by the actual safety car, which stayed out until the end of lap 18.|$|E
