40|$|While the {{pathogenesis}} of canine idiopathic dilative carchomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear, alterations of the composition and metabolism of the extracellularmatrix (ECM) are suspected to be involved. The normal hearts of 16 dogs and the hearts from 12 dogs with primary DCM were investigated grossly and histopathologically (H-E and pircrosirius red stain). The expression patterns of elastin, MMP- 2, - 9, - 14 and of TIMP- 2 and TIMP- 3 were investigated immunohistochemically. Realtime PCR {{was used to measure}} the mRNA levels of MMP- 2, MMP- 9, TIMP- 2 and TIMP- 3. Histopathologically the "attenuated <b>wavy</b> <b>fibre</b> type" (wType; n = 6) and the "fatty infiltration-degeneration type" (fType; n = 6) of DCM were diagnosed. In areas of the fType morphology, collagen III was increased, while elastin deposits were seen in regions with attenuated wavy cardiomyocytes. Immunohistochemistry showed a significant increase of MMP- 9 and a decrease of MMP- 14 expression intensity in the cardiomyocytes of the DCM group. The immunhistochemical findings did not vary between the two histopathological types of DCM. The percentage of TIMP- 3 positive fibrocytes was significantly increased in the DCM groups compared to the healthy controls. The mRNA analyses revealed a significant increase of MMP- 9 mRNA in the DCM group compared to the controls. The mRNA levels of MMP- 2, TIMP- 2 and TIMP- 3 did not vary significantly. In conclusion, the present study showed an alteration of the extracellularmatrix composition and a selective dysregulation of MMPs and TIMPs in canine idiopathic DCM. The increased MMP- 9 expression is probably a major factor in {{the pathogenesis}} Of primary DCM. The two histopathological types of DCM are not characterized by different MMP/TIMP expression patterns but show variations in ECM composition...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} problem of new bone {{formation}} in myelosclerosis bone biopsies have been performed in cases of polycythaemia vera, which may {{be regarded as a}} pre-myelosclerotic condition, and in primary myelosclerosis; morphological studies of bone and reticulin were made and osteoid and bone matrix was quantitatively assessed. Relevant metabolic studies were also carried out, but were predominantly normal. No new bone formation was detected in polycythaemia vera and some bone was osteoporotic; no significant increase in osteoid was found. With the use of polarized light it was found that new bone formation in myelosclerosis resulted from the ossification of <b>wavy</b> argyrophilic <b>fibres</b> in marrow: the presence of a dense network of these <b>wavy</b> <b>fibres</b> was a pre-requisite of new bone formation and ossification of the non-refractile branched reticulin fibres was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Human {{abdominal}} aortic {{tissue is}} a complex cylindrical soft sandwich structure, arranged in three different concentric layers. Within these layers, distribution and arrangement of all components display a double-helix architecture of <b>wavy</b> <b>fibres,</b> characterised by distinctive preferred orientations. The macroscopic mechanical behaviour of human healthy abdominal aorta (AA) and aneurysmal (AAA) tissues is highly non-linear, anisotropic and essentially hyperelastic. The global objective of this work is to design and process new artificial hy- perelastic and anisotropic membranes mimicking the macroscopic histological and mechanical features of AA and AAA tissues. These materials will be then used to build more realistic phantoms of AAA for in vitro experiments. The aim {{of the present study}} is (i) to develop a theoretical framework able to predict the optimal microstructure and mechanical behaviour of such AA/AAA analogues, and (ii) to provide experimental validation of micro-mechanical modelling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} new hyperelastic and {{anisotropic}} material mimicking histological and mechanical features of healthy and aneurysmal arterial tissues. The material is constituted by rhombic periodic lattices of hyperelastic fibres embedded into a soft elastomer membrane. To fit bi-axial experimental data obtained from the literature, with normal or pathologic human abdominal aortic tis- sues, the microstructure of the periodic lattices (fibre length, angle between fibres) together with the mechanical behaviour of the fibres (fibre tension-elongation curve) were optimised by using theoretical results arising from a multi-scale homogenisation process. It is shown that (i) a material constituted by only one periodic lattice of fibres is clearly not sufficient to describe all the experimental data set, (ii) a quantitative agreement between measurements and theoretical predictions is obtained by using a material with two fibre lattices, (iii) the optimised microstructures and mechanical properties of the fibrous lattices are strongly different for the abdominal healthy and aneurysmal arterial tissues, (iv) the anisotropic mechanical behaviour of the optimised material is described by only five parameters and (v) the optimal angles between fibres {{in the case of the}} healthy aorta are consistent with histological data. Several technical solutions of fibres can be considered as relevant candidates: this is illustrated in the particular cases of straight and <b>wavy</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soft {{stretchable}} {{materials are}} key for arising {{technologies such as}} stretchable electronics or batteries, smart textiles, biomedical devices, tissue engineering and soft robotics. Recent attempts to design such materials, via e. g. micro-patterning of <b>wavy</b> <b>fibres</b> on soft substrates, polymer engineering {{at the molecular level}} or even kirigami techniques, provide appealing prospects but suffer drawbacks impacting the material viability: complexity of manufacturing, fatigue or failure upon cycling, restricted range of materials or biological incompatibility. Here, we report a universal strategy to design highly stretchable, self-assembling and fatigue-resistant synthetic fabrics. Our approach finds its inspiration in the mechanics of living animal cells that routinely encounter and cope with extreme deformations, e. g. with the engulfment of large intruders by macrophages, squeezing and stretching of immune cells in tiny capillaries or shrinking/swelling of neurons upon osmotic stimuli. All these large instant deformations are actually mediated and buffered by membrane reserves available in the form of microvilli, membrane folds or endomembrane that can be recruited on demand. We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous liquid-infused tissues spontaneously forming surface reserves whose unfolding fuels any imposed shape change. Our process, relying only on geometry, elasticity and capillarity, allows to endow virtually any material with high stretchability and reversibility, making it straightforward to implement additional mechanical, electrical or chemical functions. We illustrate this with proof-of-concept activable capillary muscles, adaptable slippery liquid infused porous surfaces and stretchable basic printed electronic circuits...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on ductus arteriosus in buffalo foetii from 4. 2 cm CVRL (48 days) to 99. 5 cm CVRL (298 days). At 4. 2 cm CVRL, tunica intima was composed of an endothelial cell lining. At 10. 5 cm CVRL foetus, all the tunics viz. intima, media and adventitia were well defined. Tunica media became more muscular and composed of loosely arranged smooth muscle fibres in connective tissue matrix containing very fine <b>wavy</b> elastic <b>fibres</b> at 34 cm CVRL. The ductus arteriosus did not show any remarkable changes from 26 - 40 cm CVRL foetus. The distinguishing feature was the formation of intimal cushions at 50 cm CVRL foetus i. e. 186 days. At 99. 5 cm CVRL foetus (298 days) there was decrease in smooth muscle cells and increase in collagenous ground substance resulting in narrowing of lumen and obliteration of ductus arteriosus after birth.

40|$|Published onlineJOURNAL ARTICLEVascular {{diseases}} such as diabetes and hypertension cause changes to the vasculature {{that can lead to}} vessel stiffening and the loss of vasoactivity. The microstructural bases of these changes are not presently fully understood. We present a new methodology for stain-free visualisation, at a microscopic scale, of the morphology of the main passive components of the walls of unfixed resistance arteries and their response to changes in transmural pressure. Human resistance arteries were dissected from subcutaneous fat biopsies, mounted on a perfusion myograph and imaged at varying transmural pressures using a multimodal nonlinear microscope. High resolution 3 D images of elastic fibres, collagen and cell nuclei were constructed. The honeycomb structure of the elastic fibers comprising the internal elastic layer became visible at a transmural pressure of 30 mmHg. The adventitia, comprising <b>wavy</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> punctuated by straight elastic fibres, thinned under pressure as the collagen network straightened and pulled taut. Quantitative measurements of fibre orientation were made as a function of pressure. A multi-layer analytical model was used to calculate the stiffness and stress in each layer. The adventitia was calculated to be up to ten times as stiff as the media and experienced up to 8 times the stress, depending on lumen diameter. This work reveals that pressure-induced reorganisation of fibrous proteins gives rise to very high local strain fields, and highlights the unique mechanical roles of both fibrous networks. It thereby provides a basis for understanding the micromechanical significance of structural changes which occur with age and disease.

40|$|Passive {{skeletal}} muscle derives its structural {{response from the}} combination of the titin filaments in the muscle fibres, the collagen fibres in the connective tissue and incompressibility due to the high fluid content. Experiments have shown that {{skeletal muscle}} tissue presents a highly asymmetrical three-dimensional behaviour when passively loaded in tension or compression, but structural models predicting this are not available. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a mathematical model to study the internal mechanisms which resist externally applied deformation in skeletal muscle bulk. One cylindrical muscle fibre surrounded by connective tissue was considered. The collagenous fibres of the endomysium and perimysium were grouped and modelled as tension-only oriented wavy helices wrapped around the muscle fibre. The titin filaments are represented as non-linear tension-only springs. The model calculates the force developed by the titin molecules and the collagen network when the muscle fibre undergoes an isochoric along-fibre stretch. The model was evaluated using a range of literature based input parameters and compared to the experimental fibre-direction stress-stretch data available. Results show the fibre direction non-linearity and tension/compression asymmetry are partially captured by this structural model. The titin filament load dominates at low tensile stretches, but for higher stretches the collagen network was responsible for most of the stiffness. The oblique and initially <b>wavy</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> account for the non-linear tensile response since, as the collagen fibres are being recruited, they straighten and re-orient. The main contribution of the model is that it shows that the overall compression/tension response is strongly influenced by a pressure term induced by the radial component of collagen fibre stretch acting on the incompressible muscle fibre. Thus for along-fibre tension or compression the model predicts that the collagen network contributes to overall muscle stiffness through two different mechanisms: (1) a longitudinal force directly opposing tension and (2) a pressure force on the muscle fibres resulting in an indirect longitudinal load. Although the model presented considers only a single muscle fibre and evaluation is limited to along-fibre loading, this is the first model to propose these two internal mechanisms for resisting externally applied deformation of skeletal muscle tissu...|$|R
