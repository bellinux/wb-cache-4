50|$|Explained {{in another}} way, this process {{attempts}} {{to account for}} <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> from dipping reflectors and also for the spatial and directional seismic wave speed (heterogeneity) variations, which cause wavefields (modelled by ray paths) to bend, wave fronts to cross (caustics), and waves to be recorded at positions different from those that would be expected under straight ray or other simplifying assumptions. Finally, this process often attempts to also preserve and extract the formation interface reflectivity information imbedded in the seismic data amplitudes, {{so that they can}} be used to reconstruct the elastic properties of the geological formations (amplitude preservation, seismic inversion). There are a variety of migration algorithms, which can be classified by their output domain into the broad categories of time migration or depth migration, and pre-stack migration or post-stack migration (orthogonal) techniques. Depth migration begins with time data converted to depth data by a spatial geological velocity profile. Post-stack migration begins with seismic data which has already been stacked, and thus already lost valuable velocity analysis information.|$|E
5000|$|A lineatus {{uses the}} shape of the {{waveform}} to determine distance by analyzing how much the waveform has changed since it was generated; this amount of change is extremely predictable and regular. The surface waveform has high frequencies near source, and lower frequencies farther away due to the dampening effect of the water surface; the amount of decrease diminishes with distance. A lineatus’ possible use of the wavefront’s curvature can be excluded since fish are still able to judge the distance of a wave’s source with only a single functioning neuromast when all others have been ablated. When presented with single-frequency or upward frequency-modulated waves, fish underestimate the distance of the wave source; this suggests the normal downward FM of capillary waves, which arises almost immediately in <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion,</b> is necessary for A lineatus to judge distance. [...] This was confirmed in 1982 by presenting fish with waves with an artificially generated waveform so that at 7 cm the wave had the downward FM sweep of a wave 15 cm away, and fish responded to these by swimming 15 cm.|$|E
50|$|The elastic {{constants}} often {{change with}} depth, {{due to the}} changing properties of the material. This means that the velocity of a Rayleigh wave in practice becomes dependent on the wavelength (and therefore frequency), a phenomenon referred to as dispersion. Waves affected by dispersion have a different wave train shape. Rayleigh waves on ideal, homogeneous and flat elastic solids show no dispersion, as stated above. However, if a solid or structure has a density or sound velocity that varies with depth, Rayleigh waves become dispersive. One example is Rayleigh waves on the Earth's surface: those waves with a higher frequency travel more slowly than those with a lower frequency. This occurs because a Rayleigh wave of lower frequency has a relatively long wavelength. The displacement of long wavelength waves penetrates more deeply into the Earth than short wavelength waves. Since the speed of waves in the Earth increases with increasing depth, the longer wavelength (low frequency) waves can travel faster than the shorter wavelength (high frequency) waves. Rayleigh waves thus often appear spread out on seismograms recorded at distant earthquake recording stations. It is also possible to observe Rayleigh <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> in thin films or multi-layered structures.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 <b>Wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> and {{fracture}} are {{phenomena that}} involve. mechanisms triggered at {{the scale of}} a material's internal structure. Experiments were performed with a candidate material to judge the hypothesis that <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurements {{can be used to}} nondestructively predict fracture strength. Wood-based particleboard was chosen as the candidate material because the entire acoustical branch of the longitudinal <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> curve was accessible with ultrasonics. <b>Wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> and fracture were studied in detail for the weak direction of particleboard, through the panel thickness. The prediction of a relationship between <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> and fracture strength is inherent to nonlocal theory. Particleboard has a complex internal structure, rendering it a difficult material to model. Therefore, it is a good test of the generality of nonlocal theory. <b>Wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> data from particleboard was converted into nonlocal moduli using a fast Fourier transform calculation. The variable frequency/variable path-length, continuous wave method was used to measure dispersion. Dispersion in particleboard occurred at frequencies between 400 and 900 kHz. The dominating mechanism was that of micro-geometric dispersion (i. e. decreasing phase velocity with increasing frequency). Frequencies above 900 kHz were effectively "stopped" by particleboard. The dispersion response of particleboard was found to depend on board specific gravity, resin content and particle size. Mode I load-displacement curves of cracked samples of particleboard exhibited initial linear behavior, followed by nonlinear response. Compliance calibration and the J[subscript I]-Integral were used for linear and nonlinear characterization, respectively. The nonlinear behavior was due to the growth of a local damage zone {{at the tip of the}} crack. The damage zone contained permanent deformation. As a result, the strict validity of the J[subscript I]-integral approach may have been violated. The failure energy of particleboard appears to be load history dependent. The nonlocal moduli were related to stress concentration or redistribution for relatively weak or strong materials, respectively. <b>Wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> was found to have a very high correlation with the critical strain energy release rate at the onset of nonlinear behavior...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: The iron status of an individual may {{play an important role}} in cardiovascular health. Anemia is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. P <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> is a simple electrocardiographic marker that has a predictive value for the development of atrial fibrillation. Apart from cardiovascular diseases, several conditions, such as seasonal variation, alcohol intake and caffeine ingestion, have been demonstrated to affect P <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion.</b> METHODS: The study included 97 patients who had iron deficiency anemia and 50 healthy subjects. The cases were evaluated with a clinical examination and diagnostic tests that included 12 -lead electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, patients with iron deficiency anemia showed significantly longer maximum P wave duration (Pmax) (91. 1 ± 18. 0 vs. 85. 8 ± 6. 7 msec, p= 0. 054), P <b>wave</b> <b>dispersion</b> (PWD) (48. 1 ± 7. 7 vs. 40. 9 ± 5. 6 msec, p< 0. 001), mitral inflow deceleration time (DT) (197. 5 ± 27. 9 vs. 178. 8 ± 8. 9 msec, p< 0. 001) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (93. 3 ± 9. 2 vs. 77. 4 ± 8. 2 msec, p< 0. 001); they also showed increased heart rate (85. 7 ± 16. 1 vs. 69. 0 ± 4. 4, p< 0. 001) and frequency of diastolic dysfunction (7 (7. 2 %) vs. 0). Correlation analysis revealed that PWD was significantly correlated with IVRT, DT, heart rate, the presence of anemia and hemoglobin level.
