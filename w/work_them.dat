The pair had wanted to appear on an episode of the show, but when Chris Carter could find no way to <b>work</b> <b>them</b> into the show this reference was added instead. The Astadourian Lightning Observatory {{was named after}} Mary Astadourian, Chris Carter's executive assistant. Darin Oswald was named after writer Darin Morgan.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to <b>work</b> <b>them</b> into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
25|$|Eluvial deposits—those {{that had}} {{weathered}} from the lode {{in the usual}} way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits {{due to the lack}} of sorting that a stream provides, and they usually did not have such a ready supply of water available to <b>work</b> <b>them.</b> They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.|$|E

25|$|Haworth's {{population}} grew rapidly {{during the first}} half of the 18thcentury, from hardly 1,000 to 3,365 in 50 years. The village did not have a sewage system and the well water was contaminated by faecal matter and the decomposition of bodies in the cemetery on the hilltop. Life expectancy was less than 25 years and infant mortality was around 41% of children under six months of age. Most of the population lived from working the poorly fertile land of the moors and supplemented their incomes with work done at home, such as spinning and weaving wool from the sheep that were farmed on the moors. Conditions changed and the textile industry, already present since the end of the 17thcentury, grew in the mills on the banks of the River Worth, whose waters turned the wheels which consequently required fewer people to <b>work</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carl L. Norden Company {{incorporated}} in 1931, supplying the sights under a dedicated source contract. In effect, {{the company was}} owned by the Navy. In 1934 the newly-forming GHQ Air Force, the purchasing arm of the US Army Air Corps, selected the Norden for their bombers as well, as the M-1. However, due to the dedicated source contract, the Army had to buy the sights from the Navy. This was not only annoying for inter-service rivalry reasons, but the Air Corps' higher-speed bombers demanded several changes to the design, notably the ability to aim the sighting telescope further forward to give the bombardier more time to set up. The Navy {{was not interested in}} these changes, and would not promise to <b>work</b> <b>them</b> in. Worse, Norden's factories were having serious problems keeping up with demand for the Navy alone, and in January 1936, the Navy suspended all shipments to the Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the stories {{involved}} in these puppet plays comes from the kingdoms of eastern Java: Jenggala, Kediri and Majapahit. From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelaras, which tells of the adventures {{of a pair of}} village youngsters with their fighting cocks. The Damarwulan presents the stories of a hero from Majapahit. Damarwulan is a clever chap, who with courage, aptitude, intelligence and the assistance of his young lover Anjasmara, makes a surprise attack on the neighboring kingdom and brings down Minakjinggo, an Adipati (viceroy) of Blambangan and mighty enemy of Majapahit's beautiful queen Sri Ratu Kencanawungu. As a reward, Damarwulan is married to Kencanawungu and becomes king of Majapahit; he also takes Lady Anjasmara as a second wife. This story is full of love affairs and battles and is very popular with the public. The dalang is liable to incorporate the latest local gossip and quarrels and <b>work</b> <b>them</b> into the play as comedy.|$|E

2500|$|One {{suggested}} {{example of}} a Kido Butai transmission is the November 30, 1941, COMSUM14 report in which Rochefort mentioned a [...] "tactical" [...] circuit heard calling [...] "marus". (a term often used for commercial vessels or non-combat units). Further, the perspective of U.S. naval intelligence at the time was, [...] "...The significance of the term, 'tactical circuit' is that the vessel itself, that is Akagi, was using its own radio to call up the other vessels directly rather than <b>work</b> <b>them</b> through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in Japanese communications. The working of the Akagi with the Marus, indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function, since a carrier would rarely address a maru." ...|$|E
2500|$|The London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) was {{a railway}} company in {{south-eastern}} England created on 1 August 1859, when the [...] East Kent Railway was given Parliamentary approval {{to change its}} name. Its lines ran through London and northern and eastern Kent to form {{a significant part of}} the Greater London commuter network. The company existed until 31 December 1922 when its assets were merged with those of other companies to form the Southern Railway as a result of the grouping [...] determined by the Railways Act 1921. The railway was always in a difficult financial situation and went bankrupt in 1867, but was able to continue to operate. Many of the difficulties were caused by the severe competition and duplication of services with the South Eastern Railway (SER). However, in 1898 the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways, <b>work</b> <b>them</b> as a single system (as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies with separate shareholders until both becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.|$|E
2500|$|The SD's {{goal was}} to make Latvia judenrein, a Nazi {{neologism}} which can be translated as [...] "Jew free." [...] By October 15, 1941, the Nazis had murdered up to 30,000 of the approximately 66,000 Jews {{that had not been}} able to flee the country before the Nazi occupation was completed. [...] Hinrich Lohse, who reported to Alfred Rosenberg rather than the SD's boss, Heinrich Himmler, wanted not so much to exterminate the Jews but rather to steal all their property, confine them to ghettos, and <b>work</b> <b>them</b> as slave laborers for Germany's war effort. [...] This bureaucratic conflict slowed down the pace of killing in September and October 1941. [...] Lohse, as part of the [...] "civil administration" [...] was perceived by the SD as resisting their plans. [...] On November 15, 1941, Lohse asked for directions from Rosenberg as to whether all Jews were to be murdered [...] "regardless of economic considerations." [...] By the end of October, Lohse had confined all the Jews of Riga, as well some of the surrounding area, into a ghetto within the city, the gates of which were about 10 kilometers from Rumbula. The Riga Ghetto was a creation of the Nazis themselves, and had not existed before the war.|$|E

2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and I was left with the impression that I have not succeeded in getting the hang of this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly <b>work</b> <b>them</b> out".|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{tried to}} hire an {{overseer}} to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, [...] "I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will be firm & make them do their duty." [...] But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and {{had to take a}} two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself. He found the experience frustrating, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay. In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, [...] "I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks & Edward, {{in the beginning of the}} previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, & said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them & lodging them in jail. They resisted till overpowered & called upon the other people to rescue them." [...] Less than two months after they were sent to the Alexandria jail, Lee decided to remove these three men and three female house slaves from Arlington, and sent them under lock and key to the slave-trader William Overton Winston in Richmond, who was instructed to keep them in jail until he could find [...] "good & responsible" [...] slaveholders to <b>work</b> <b>them</b> until the end of the five-year period.|$|E
2500|$|Constitutionally, Congress {{could not}} deal with slavery in the states but it did have {{jurisdiction}} in the western territories. California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and <b>work</b> <b>them</b> with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were actually interested in Kansas, {{but the idea that}} slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of state's rights. With the passage of the extremely controversial Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North a new major party was formed to fight slavery: the Republican Party, with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called [...] "Jayhawkers" [...] or [...] "Free-soilers") financed the migration of politically determined settlers. But pro-slavery advocates fought back with pro-slavery settlers from Missouri. Violence on both sides was the result; in all 56 men were killed by the time the violence abated in 1859. By 1860 the pro-slavery forces were in control—but Kansas had only two slaves. The antislavery forces took over by 1861, as Kansas became a free state. The episode demonstrated that a democratic compromise between North and South over slavery was impossible and served to hasten the Civil War.|$|E
