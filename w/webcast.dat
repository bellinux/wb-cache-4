40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of lecture <b>webcasting,</b> and to summarize findings from several formal evaluations of the technology. We focus on questions of attendance, learning outcomes, student behavior with regard to access of archived <b>webcasts,</b> and effects on instructor behavior and quality of teaching. Studies indicate that the use of lecture <b>webcasting</b> for the purposes of archive and review is pedagogically neutral. While lecture <b>webcasts</b> do not affect student performance, there is some evidence that their availability improves the student’s educational experience by reducing stress and providing an additional study resource. To improve learning outcomes, instructors must think creatively about using <b>webcasting</b> technology to free up valuable classroom time for more interactive discussions and activities...|$|R
