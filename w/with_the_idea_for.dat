5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a {{new board}} game called RoboRally, but {{was turned down}} because the game {{would have been too}} expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E
5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship and go on a killing spree. In addition, Spotnitz also came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed {{at the end of}} the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Love Productions {{approached}} the BBC <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a programme that would feature a prominent {{member of the}} business community working with unemployed people, but the show did not come to fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as People Like Us and Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman.

5|$|When {{planning}} an episode, the writers started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the episode and determined the main story arc.

5|$|While {{promoting}} Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> {{the film}} when fielding {{a question about}} his own belief {{in the existence of}} alien life. He and Dean Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth.

25|$|The nationalities {{policy was}} {{formulated}} by the Bolshevik party in 1913, {{four years before}} they {{came to power in}} Russia. Vladimir Lenin sent a young Joseph Stalin (himself a Georgian and therefore an ethnic minority member) to Vienna, at the time a very ethnically diverse city (capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire). Stalin reported back to Moscow <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> policy. It was summarized in Stalin's pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), Marxism and the National Question (1913). Ironically Stalin would also be the major proponent of its eventual dismemberment and the reemergence of Russification.|$|R

5|$|Archie Ledbrooke, {{a sports}} {{reporter}} for the Daily Mirror and the first treasurer of the Cricket Writers' Club, came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the award.

In 1986, the vote was tied, and the award was made jointly to Ashley Metcalfe of Nottinghamshire and James Whitaker of Leicestershire. The 1995 winner, Andrew Symonds, went on to make over 200 international appearances for Australia, {{but at the time}} of his award was eligible to play for England, as he was born in Birmingham. , representatives of seventeen of the eighteen first-class cricket counties have won the award; no player from Worcestershire has ever won. Yorkshire players have collected the award most frequently, doing so on eleven occasions. Only eight winners have not gone on to play international cricket.|$|E
5|$|De Bont came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> {{the film}} {{after he had}} a {{recurring}} nightmare about a cruise ship crashing into an island. Speed star Keanu Reeves was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel, but decided not to commit {{and was replaced by}} Patric prior to filming. Production took place aboard Seabourn Legend, the ship on which the film is set. The film's final scene, when the ship crashes into the island of Saint Martin, cost almost a quarter of the film's budget, and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed. Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on soundstages in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The film's soundtrack featured mostly reggae music. Mark Mancina returned to compose the film score, which was released as an album 13 years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Estianty {{was born}} in Surabaya, East Java, and showed {{interest}} in music at an early age, winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school; it was around this time that she first met Dhani. After studying at the University of Indonesia, Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist. In 1999, she and Dhani came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the musical duo Ratu. Estianty played the music, while other women– first Pinkan Mambo, then Mulan Jameela– sang. Ratu was highly successful. After {{the dissolution of the}} band in 2007 and a bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan.

5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} he came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers {{about what to do}} if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|Nixon in China is {{an opera}} in three acts by John Adams, with a {{libretto}} by Alice Goodman. Adams' first opera, it {{was inspired by}} U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto {{was the result of}} considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{developed}} by Bullfrog Productions under Peter Molyneux, who wrote the game design, testbed, and the computer players and assistant. In an interview, Molyneux explained that he came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> Dungeon Keeper while sitting in a traffic jam, and become so engrossed in them that when the traffic had moved, he did not notice. Bullfrog's chairman Les Edgar stated that the intention was to use the Dungeons & Dragons theme with [...] "slightly weird Bullfrog humour". Programmers Simon and Dene Carter also said Dungeon Keeper is a parody. Dungeon Keeper is a simulation game because Molyneux viewed the villain's duty as a management exercise.|$|R

5|$|The {{concept for}} having an episode {{dedicated}} to The Lone Gunmen arose when the show's producers {{were forced to}} start production of the fifth season {{in the last week}} of August in Vancouver, but still needed series stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson for the filming of The X-Files movie in Los Angeles. The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen, and writing duties were assigned to Vince Gilligan. Gilligan initially drafted a story involving nanotechnology, which was rejected by series creator Chris Carter. Carter came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the episode to be how The Lone Gunmen met. Gilligan then developed the script, which took place in the city of Baltimore. The scenes with Duchovny were shot {{a few weeks after the}} rest of the episode.|$|E
5|$|The first Music City Bowl was {{scheduled}} for 1998, but the bowl's beginnings dated from 1996, when city officials and local companies came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the game. Their plan developed through 1997, when financing was obtained and the NCAA approved the bowl game. Initial plans anticipated matching a Southeastern Conference team against one from the Mid-American Conference. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1998 college football season, Music City Bowl officials signed an agreement with the SEC to select the conference's sixth bowl-eligible team. The Music City Bowl's other spot was left for an at-large bid, though officials met several times with Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese in an effort to reach a contract. An agreement pledging the Big East's No. 4 bowl-eligible team to the game was not reached until 1999.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> {{the plot}} because {{he used to}} live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators {{had to come up with}} a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
