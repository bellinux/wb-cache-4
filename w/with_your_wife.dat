His wife Betty accommodated his hectic schedule by completing major chores and errands during the week so weekends would be free for family activities. Grissom refused to let work problems intrude on his time at home, and tried to complete technical reading or paperwork after the boys were asleep.

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to talk about}} blood atonement as a theocratic form of capital punishment whose time was [...] "nigh at hand," [...] church leaders also discussed unofficial blood atonement. According to one interpretation of Brigham Young's sermon on March 16, 1856, the sermon encouraged enforcement of the doctrine by individuals in certain situations. He said that if [...] "you found your brother in bed <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>wife,</b> and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God." [...] He said, [...] "under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and I would do it with clean hands."
