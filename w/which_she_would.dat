5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{downsizing}} {{to a small}} apartment, Susan and Mike {{are still}} struggling financially. Susan receives an offer from her landlord, Maxine Rosen (Lainie Kazan), to appear on her home-run erotic website"Va-Va-Va-Broom!"for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> film herself doing housework in lingerie. She initially refuses the offer, but when Mike considers taking a job on an oil rig in Alaska, Susan agrees {{to appear on the}} website; however, she conceals her new job from her friends and family.|$|E
60|$|She {{said little}} to that, except that, <b>she</b> said, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> give her as little trouble as possible; {{but she was}} afraid she should {{sometimes}} be uneasy to her, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> excuse. My Quaker told her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> much rather excuse her if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> forbear; for that if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> believe her, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> assure her <b>she</b> should never get any intelligence of me by her.|$|R
60|$|She {{winced at}} the insult, and the tears <b>which</b> <b>she</b> fain <b>would</b> have hidden from him, rose involuntarily to her eyes.|$|R

5|$|McCool then {{defeated}} Gail Kim on the May 22 {{episode of}} SmackDown! {{to become the}} number-one contender for the WWE Women's Championship, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> win a month later, on June 28, at The Bash by defeating Melina. With the win, McCool {{became the first woman}} in WWE history to hold both the Diva's and Women's titles and hence created history again. She retained the championship against Melina in a rematch on July 26 at Night of Champions, and also in a Lumberjill match on the October 2 episode of SmackDown!.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, {{although}} she is not {{playing the role of}} Martha Jones, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{season ended}} in {{disappointment}} for Neuner in Oslo. After claiming her 24th career {{win in the}} sprint, she had moved into {{second place in the}} Overall World Cup ranking. However, she again suffered from a cold and had {{to pull out of the}} penultimate race of the winter, the pursuit in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have started 31seconds in front. This effectively ended her hopes of retaining the World Cup crown. She eventually finished fifth in the overall standings, having missed five of the season's 26 races.|$|E
25|$|Upon her ouster as CEO, Wachner {{was denied}} her {{contractual}} $25 million golden parachute. She sued {{the company and}} in 2002 she accepted $3.5 million in new Warnaco stock and $200,000 in cash, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> donate to cancer research. Wachner stayed {{on the board of}} directors until her term expired in 2003.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album as a solo record, on <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E
5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, {{and she used}} the money to invest in land; she believed this would protect her from currency devaluation. The dowager duchess purchased Wimbledon manor in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E
5|$|Women in Washington social circles led by Floride Calhoun, {{the wife}} of Vice President John C. Calhoun, snubbed the Eatons because they married so soon after John Timberlake's death, rather than waiting for the usual {{mourning}} period; there were stories that Eaton and Peggy Timberlake had been having an affair before John Timberlake had died. Rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. They refused to attend social events at <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be present. According to Emily Donelson, Eaton considered resigning in {{the first months of}} the administration.|$|E
6000|$|The {{scrap of}} paper {{contained}} a message--a message addressed to her in that name of <b>which</b> <b>she</b> was so proud--the name <b>which</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never be allowed to bear again: Lady Anthony Dewhurst. She reiterated the words several times, her lips clinging lovingly to them--and just below them {{there was a small}} device, drawn in red ink ... a tiny flower with five petals....|$|R

5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark, {{which follows}} {{the events of}} Blood-C, {{is set in a}} version of Earth where humans are preyed upon by monsters called Elder Bairns; to keep humans safe, the Elder Bairns honor a {{covenant}} dubbed Shrovetide, a contract between humans and Elder Bairns that allows Elder Bairns to feed on humans for a limited period of time. During the events of Blood-C, Saya Kisaragi fights Elder Bairns attacking her village. It is eventually revealed that Saya is an Elder Bairn barred from drinking human blood by an oath—captured by Fumito Nanahara, head of the organization that supervises Shrovetide, she entered a wager in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> subject herself to an experiment, with her prize being the reneging of her oath. The experiment fails, and everyone involved is massacred aside from Fumito, his ally Yūka Amino, and Saya herself. Betrayed by Fumito, Saya swears vengeance against him. By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the use of the internet.|$|E
5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend more time with her husband, and partly to take other roles <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> otherwise not be able to do. She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E
5|$|Season five {{features}} Monica and Chandler {{trying to}} keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally thought {{that there were two}} boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.) Emily states that the only condition in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> remain married to Ross is if he stops all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together, Emily phones Ross and, upon discovering Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him, which ends the marriage. Phoebe begins a relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and happiness of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel.|$|E

5|$|The first 20th-century {{production}} of Rinaldo {{which can be}} specifically verified was a performance in London, in February 1933, by pupils of the Hammersmith Day Continuation School, though Dean and Knapp mention a shortened version, in Czech, at the Prague Conservatory in 1923. The first modern professional performance was at the Halle Opera House in June 1954, under Horst-Tanu Margraf, {{as part of the}} Handel Festival. On 17 May 1961 the Handel Opera Society, directed by Charles Farncombe, staged the work at London's Sadler's Wells Theatre, a production that was revived four years later. The first American performance was a concert version at Carnegie Hall on 27 March 1972, given by the Handel Society of New York, with Stephen Simon conducting and Beverly Wolff as Rinaldo. The first staging of the opera in America was at the Houston Grand Opera under Lawrence Foster, in October 1975, with Marilyn Horne in the title role, a part with <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> become particularly associated.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Margaret and {{her sister}} Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. Although John {{provided}} them with a strongly Christian education and {{a belief in the}} inferiority of women, both of <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both became fluent in German. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, South London. There, they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace, while their father worked at his firm's London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak. In 1887, she returned to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where her sister had moved to with her new husband.|$|E
5|$|Lord Bridport {{had been}} {{replaced}} as commander of the Channel Fleet by Admiral Lord St Vincent in mid-1799, and the long blockade cruises were sustained throughout the winter and into the following year. On 20 April 1800 Puget was superseded as commander by Captain Edward Marsh. Marsh commanded Temeraire through the remainder of that year {{and for the first}} half of 1801, until his replacement, Captain Thomas Eyles, arrived to resume command on 31 August. Rear Admiral Whitshed had also struck his flag by now, and Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral George Campbell. By this time the Second Coalition against France had collapsed, and negotiations for peace were underway at Amiens. Lord St Vincent had been promoted to First Lord of the Admiralty, and command of the Channel Fleet passed to Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. With the end of the war imminent, Temeraire was taken off blockade duty and sent to Bantry Bay to await the arrival of a convoy, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> then escort to the West Indies. Many of the crew had been serving continuously in the navy since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had looked forward to returning to England now that peace seemed imminent. On hearing rumours that instead they were to be sent to the West Indies, around a dozen men began to agitate for the rest of the crew to refuse orders to sail for anywhere but England.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E
