5|$|The {{first known}} {{recorded}} accounts of floods along the Red River {{appeared in the}} 1770s. Severe floods occurred throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recent major floods occurring in 1979. Homes not damaged in that flood were incorrectly assumed to be safe from a future flood.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed {{in place of}} the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{interior}} renovation was in 1922, under {{the ownership of}} managing director Sir Alfred Butt, {{at a cost of}} ₤150,000, leaving a four-tiered theatre able to seat just over 2,000 people. It was decorated <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable interiors produced by the specialist ornamental plasterwork company of Clark and Fenn. Composer and performer Ivor Novello, immensely popular in his time though little-remembered today, presented his musicals in Drury Lane from 1931 until the theatre was closed in 1939 because of the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war the theatre served as the headquarters for the Entertainments National Service Association; it sustained some minor bomb damage as well. The theatre reopened with Noël Coward's Pacific 1860 in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The public façade of {{the palace}} faces {{directly}} onto a town square and {{takes the form of}} two low, symmetrical, quadrant wings which flank the forward-reaching wings of a small central corps de logis, thus forming a semi-circular cour d'honneur (see key 1). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the onion-domed chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and servants' quarters (see keys 2, 1 and 13). The only decoration comes from the simple classical pediments above the windows. This façade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> architecturally severe elevations {{of the palace}} (see illustration right).|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Brodeur {{finished}} {{among the}} league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued {{to lead the}} league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. The next season, in 2002–03, Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the first time. He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a Hart Memorial Trophy finalist for the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named a 1st Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. <b>With</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after seven-game series wins against the top-seeded Ottawa Senators and the 7th-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall, breaking the NHL record of 6 {{that had been set}} by Dominik Hašek the previous year. Despite this, the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since Ron Hextall of Philadelphia in 1987. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates, resulting in a split vote among the sportswriters who selected the winner.|$|E
5|$|Kochab aside, {{three more}} stellar {{systems have been}} {{discovered}} to contain planets. 11 Ursae Minoris is an orange giant of spectral type K4III around 1.8times as massive as the Sun. Around 1.5 billion years old, it has cooled and expanded since it was an A-type main sequence star. Around 390 light-years distant, it shines with an apparent magnitude of 5.04. A planet around 11 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered orbiting the star with a period of 516 days in 2009. HD 120084 is another evolved star, this time a yellow giant of spectral type G7III, around 2.4 times {{the mass of the}} Sun. It has a planet 4.5 times the mass of Jupiter <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> eccentric planetary orbits (with an eccentricity of 0.66), discovered by precisely measuring the radial velocity of the star in 2013. HD 150706 is a sunlike star of spectral type G0V some 89 light-years distant from the Solar System. It was thought to have a planet as massive as Jupiter at a distance of 0.6 AU, but this was discounted in 2007. A further study published in 2012 showed that it has a companion around 2.7 times as massive as Jupiter that takes around 16 years to complete an orbit and is 6.8 AU distant from its Sun.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{was faced}} <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> serious energy crises {{in its history}} in 2001-2002.

Additionally, several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the Itaipu hydropower plant accounted for a third of the energy deficit. Reservoir levels reached such low levels that supply could not be ensured for more than four months.|$|E
