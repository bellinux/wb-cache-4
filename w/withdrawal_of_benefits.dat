We use rich register data which allow us to distinguish between a warning that a benefit reduction may {{take place in the}} near future and the actual <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> unemployment <b>benefits.</b> Adopting a multivariate mixed proportional hazard approach to address selectivity, we find that warnings do not affect subsequent employment stability but do reduce post-unemployment earnings.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of {{effective}} taxation {{at the lower end}} of the income scale in Germany. For the recipients of social income maintenance [...] currently about 1. 8 million nationals [...] effective taxation consists not only of the explicit taxation through the tax code but also of the implicit taxation through the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> The paper calculates effective tax rates for recipients of social assistance; it is shown that for labor incomes in the lower income range explicit and implicit taxation add up to a marginal burden of just under 75 percent on average. The 1996 tax reform alleviates the explicit tax burden on low incomes, but it does not alleviate the total marginal burden on labor earnings of welfare recipients. It increases net incomes, but since the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> increases with net incomes, too, the overall burden remains practically unchanged. Therefore, effective welfare traps remain prevalent; these could only be avoided through a reform of the system of social assistance and withdrawal. Constraints and possible steps for reform are discussed. ...|$|E

To understand when and why an angry individual becomes violent we must understand what anger is and what function it solves. The recalibrational theory of anger is a computational evolutionary model that maintains that the function of anger is to recalibrate individuals who place insufficient weight on the welfare of the angry individual when making decisions, i. e. anger raises the target's welfare tradeoff ratio (WTR). Features of anger that can be explained from this perspective include the major triggers of anger, the content of anger-based arguments, individual differences in anger thresholds, and the selective deployment of negotiative tactics such as the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and the infliction of costs. When certain criteria are met, cost infliction will take the form of violent aggression and can be understood as a bargaining tactic designed to recalibrate the target's WTR.

40|$|The Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement, {{concluded}} {{as part of}} the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, is {{a particularly}} ambitious international agreement in that aims to set a common floor for intellectual property protection in all World Trade Organization (WTO) members. Leading developing country governments vigorously resisted the conclusion of the agreement for philosophical and economic reasons, but under heavy pressure from developed country governments eventually accepted it. Despite their objections, almost all developing country governments have taken steps to comply with the TRIPS Agreement, many have done so before they were required to and many adopted more rigorous IPR rules than strictly required by TRIPs. This article seeks to explain this puzzle by testing explanations compliance derived from realism, which emphasizes the importance of great power coercion; neo-liberalism, which stresses coercion, but also the costs associated with reciprocal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and a loss of reputation as a reliable partner; and constructivism, which tends to focus on the legitimacy of the international rule.

40|$|There is a {{pressing}} {{need for a}} better understanding of how access to various types of financial products can impact retirement behavior, especially if this access comes from a change in the incentive scheme through a reform of the current Social Security system. This is especially important if we are to provide useful policy recommendations regarding reform to the current social insurance system. In this paper I focus on the "annuity puzzle," the question as to why the annuity market is so narrow. I present a model that endogenizes the annuity decision along with the consumption/saving and labor supply decisions. This research enhances our understanding of how annuities work in a life cycle model with more realistic characterizations of the choices and incentives that individuals face. My results show that the low rates of annuitization can be the product of optimal decision making by individuals in a life cycle model which endogenizes the labor/leisure decision and accounts for Social Security.

50|$|The {{welfare trap}} (or {{unemployment}} trap or poverty trap in British English) theory asserts that taxation and welfare systems can jointly contribute {{to keep people}} on social insurance because the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> means tested <b>benefits</b> that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income.

30|$|Monitoring alone yields either zero results (in Hungary and Sweden (4)), or short-run {{positive}} results (in Germany (8), UK (4)) and long-run negative results {{due to increased}} long-run exits from the labor force. The studies for Hungary and Sweden evaluate the effect of an increased (announced) monitoring intensity and do not find any affect on employment rates. While the program set-up differs in many details, both interventions are reported to exhibit rather low actual risks of sanctioning for non-compliance in job search or for turning down job offers, which may hence {{have resulted in a}} low level of compliance. The study in the UK, in contrast, considers a policy reform increasing the actual risk of sanctioning, finding that after an initially positive employment effect, the medium-run effects on employment are negative, as youth tend to resort to alternative sources of social benefits, exempting them from any job search activities. Furthermore, negative effects on wage levels are found, the absolute size of which are larger for youth than for adults. The study for Germany (8) assesses the effects of temporary benefit withdrawal and finds substantial positive short-run employment effects that are increasing with the intensity of the sanction. While the effect on employment quality is not available, the authors suggest that the complete <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> may have had substantial negative effects on employment quality or labor force participation.|$|E
40|$|Early {{retirement}} is predominantly {{considered to be}} the result of incentives set by social security and the tax system. But the Swiss example demonstrates that the incidence of early retirement has dramatically increased even in the absence of institutional changes. We argue that an actuarially fair, but mandatory funded system may also distort optimal individual allocation. If individuals are credit constraint (or just reluctant to borrow), a higher than desired retirement capital induces people to retire earlier than they would have in the absence of such a scheme. Individuals thus retire as soon as the retirement income is deemed sufficient the pension plan avails <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> We provide evidence using individual data from a selection of Swiss pension funds, allowing us to perfectly control for pension scheme details. Our findings suggest that affordability is indeed a key determinant in the retirement decisions. The fact that early retirement has become much more prevalent in the last 15 years is a strong indicator for the importance of affordability as the maturing the Swiss mandatory funded pension system over that period has led to an increase in the already high effective replacement rates. Moreover, even after controlling for the time trend, the higher the accumulated pension capital, the earlier men, and - to a smaller extent - women, tend to leave the work force. ...|$|E

The plan proposed to replace cash disbursements with vouchers for food, clothing, and rent, and threatened unwed mothers who gave birth to further illegitimate children with the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> their <b>benefits.</b> It required able-bodied men on relief to work 40 hours a week for the city.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{announced}} {{a far more}} radical series of reforms intended to simplify the benefits and tax credits scheme into a single payment {{to be known as}} Universal Credit.

30|$|The second Coalition {{flagship}} {{change to}} the activation regime–Universal Credit (UC)–is even more radical in ambition.

Support for childcare via the benefit system will be made available for parents regardless of the number of hours they work–under the old system, they had to work at least 16 hours per week to qualify for support. The aim of UC is to improve work incentives for most families compared with the current system. It is hoped that by getting more of such families into work that this will reduce poverty and cut back on public spending on welfare benefits. UC began to be implemented slowly in 2013 and it is planned to be fully operational by 2018.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern and {{interest}} in government, and more broadly, in the way that housing assistance and income support systems interact to provide incentives or disincentives for unemployed people to enter paid employment (Industry Commission 1993; Croce 2000). Research outside Australia has highlighted the critical role that housing assistance plays in the decisions that unemployed people make when offered work (Hirsch 1994; Randolph 1994; Giles et al. 1996; Ford, Kempson and England 1996; Wilcox and Sutherland 1997). This research suggests that decisions about moving into paid employment typically involve trade offs between the financial, personal and family benefits expected from participation in paid employment relative to costs in terms of loss of income support payments and impact on personal and family well being. In particular, these studies have pointed to the complex interactions between incomes from paid employment and government benefits, including the combined effect <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> government <b>benefits</b> and housing assistance, the type and nature of housing costs, and the behaviour of those seeking employment.

5000|$|An {{incentive}} {{to get out}} of the welfare trap is that the return to the labour market gives a person chances of moving up the career ladder, improving old and acquiring new job skills, etc., thus eventually improving standard of living. Policies that allow for the continued receipt <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> payments for a period of time after entering work or up to a specific earnings ceiling may also eliminate the welfare trap. For example, for UK claimants <b>of</b> Incapacity <b>Benefit</b> or Employment Support Allowance, [...] "permitted work" [...] arrangements allow for paid work up to either 16 hours or £95 per week without the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the disability <b>benefit</b> payments, leading to a net overall increase in income. However, any earnings over £20 may be taxed, and additional earnings may affect receipt <b>of</b> Housing <b>Benefit</b> and Council Tax Benefit, which is an example of the welfare trap reamaining potentially in effect. To eliminate the welfare trap entirely would require a policy that permanently continues <b>benefit</b> payments regardless <b>of</b> any conditions, with no income from paid work being withdrawn.

40|$|In Serbia the {{inactivity}} {{rate of the}} working-age population is close to 40 %, {{among the highest in}} Europe. The country also faces a high informal employment rate of 24 %. Previous research has argued that high levels of informality and inactivity are mostly due to a high effective tax wedge at low wage levels caused by a minimum base for calculation of social security contributions (SSC), sudden <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> means-tested <b>benefits</b> once formal income is earned, and low progressivity of income tax. This paper evaluates the impact of the minimum SSC base reform scenarios on labour supply and employment formalization using tax and benefit micro-simulation models together with the structural discrete choice labour supply model based on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions Data. Although we do not find positive employment effects of the reform, it would be premature to deduce that abolishment of the minimum SSC base is not needed. At this stage in our research, until alternative labour-supply modelling is applied, with both sector and hours of work choice alternatives, it is only safe to conclude that the proposed reform will not significantly contribute to the transformation of informal full-time to formal full-time jobs...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{incentive}} effects of retirement income transfers – essentially, non-contributory cash transfers {{aimed at reducing}} poverty among the elderly. A literature review reveals how little academic analysis {{of the impact of}} these transfers has been completed. We begin with a taxonomy of retirement income transfers, differentiating between ex-ante and ex-post interventions and universal and targeted arrangements. This distinction allows important differences across designs to be highlighted. We then provide a simple framework for thinking about what the incentive impacts of the transfers might be, distinguishing between effects related to the transfer itself and those related to the financing mechanism. Thus, from theory and available empirical evidence we derive a few policy relevant findings. First, incentive effects will depend on the level of the transfer relative to average earnings and the degree of integration between the formal and informal sectors in the economy. In general, for modest transfers, negative impacts on savings and labor supply would be contained. Second, we highlight the tradeoff between maintaining low effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) to reduce distortions and keeping the program costs at affordable levels. This tradeoff suggests that universal programs are suboptimal. Third, in terms of design features, we emphasize the importance of implementing a gradual <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>benefit</b> to avoid crowding-out contributory pensions among low income individuals and of indexing the eligibility age with life expectancy to contain costs. Finally we find that matching contributions can be a promising instrument to promote savings among individuals with limited savings capacity. ...|$|R
