6000|$|Hetta, {{as soon as}} she had {{dismissed}} her lover, went up at once to her own room. Thither she {{was soon}} followed by her mother, whose anxious ear had heard the closing of the front door. 'Well; what has he said?' asked Lady Carbury.

The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had. Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better. My wife should have the credit of them, however.

Her beauty cannot be described. It is not our kind of beauty. It is something ethereal, something heavenly, something that we'll only see in Paradise and then only to a certain degree.” [...] Visionary Mirjana, in her autobiography, says that when they asked Gospa, [...] "How {{is it possible that}} you are so beautiful?"
