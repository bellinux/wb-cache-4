5|$|Within {{the diocese}} of Constance, Bernhardin Sanson was {{offering}} a special indulgence for contributors to the building of St Peter's in Rome. When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> on false pretences. This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he {{could come up with}} for the companies, make off <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money,</b> and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E

The retailer has noticed an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession. Customers tend to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rate the chain 4.5/5 on average.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 Courtneidge and Hulbert {{suffered}} a serious setback when {{they discovered that}} their financial manager had been speculating <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money,</b> suffering heavy losses and putting their business into liquidation. Hulbert accepted responsibility for all the business's debts and undertook to repay every creditor. To achieve this, he and Courtneidge temporarily went their separate professional ways, reasoning that they could earn more as individual stars than as a double act. A boom in the film industry enabled both to earn large sums; Courtneidge appeared in 11 British films and one Hollywood film in the 1930s. She was amused to find that in eight weeks in a film studio she could earn more than she could in {{a year in the}} theatre. She and Hulbert managed to work together on several films, including The Ghost Train (1931) and Jack's the Boy (1932).|$|E
25|$|The King {{was unable}} to officially declare a war if the {{decision}} was not fully approved or supported by the Sejm and the Senate. The Sejm usually consisted of around 600 nobles, diplomats and most influential politicians, who met annually at Warsaw or elsewhere, in order to contribute {{as little as possible}} to public needs and protest vehemently against everything they did not like or could not understand. The nobility was also in favour of absolute non-intervention in foreign affairs, as the cheapest and least troublesome policy to pursue. The unwillingness of the Polish gentry to part <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money,</b> especially for armaments, was entirely due to the fear that a popular monarch might curtail their privileges. Rather than run that risk, they avoided every advantageous alliance, forgoing every political opportunity, stinted their armies, starved and abandoned their generals, and even left the territories of the Commonwealth unguarded and undefended. This was the case of Livonia, with its fine seaboard and hundreds of towns and fortresses, which had temporarily fallen into the lap of Poland. It was later retaken by Sweden due to poor organization of the army and disinterest of the nobles to finance any military actions or campaigns. The regular army, on the other hand, was very effective against enemy troops, especially in Polish-occupied Ukraine (Ruthenia), where it had an almost unlimited reserve of the best raw military material. Moreover, the army was led by Zamoyski, Żółkiewski, Chodkiewicz and Stanisław Koniecpolski, four of the greatest generals and military commanders of the age.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} to Terre Haute in 1874, Dresser and his father resumed their hostile relationship. Dresser also resumed to his old habits of {{spending}} time with delinquents and drinking. At age sixteen Dresser {{took a job as}} a teacher and musician at a Catholic church in Brazil, Indiana, but left after less than a year. Shortly thereafter, Charley Kelly, a traveling minstrel, hired Dresser to join his act as a piano player. The two traveled around southern Indiana, playing wherever they could to earn a meager income. After a few months, Kelly disappeared <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> during a show, leaving Dresser with no funds to pay their lodging or food bills. Dresser spent two days in jail as punishment. After his release Dresser went to Indianapolis in search of work and was reunited with his mentor, Father Alerding, who had been recently moved to the city. Although Dresser was only a teen, Alerding gave him a job as a teacher at St. Joseph Catholic Church. In 1876, after he had taught for a full year, Dresser returned to his family in Terre Haute. Almost immediately he resumed his old way of life and spent most of his savings on liquor at a local bar. As his money ran low, Dresser turned to crime, robbing two saloons of whiskey and cash after they had closed for the night. Dresser was jailed for ten weeks before his trial, convicted, fined, and sentenced to another month of jail time. Released in June 1876, Dresser, who was not yet twenty years old, returned to his parents' home in disgrace.|$|E
500|$|The Democratic {{landslide}} {{that accompanied}} Roosevelt's election cost Borah his {{chairmanship of the}} Foreign Relations Committee, but much of his influence was independent of party. Borah liked Roosevelt for his liberalism and his energy. [...] Due to illness, Borah took only a limited role in Roosevelt's Hundred Days, though he did play a key part in the passage of Glass–Steagall in June 1933, helping forge a compromise that ended the opponents' filibuster. He opposed Roosevelt's calling in of gold, alleging {{that the government had}} no power to tell individuals what to do <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> Borah opposed the National Recovery Act (NRA) and was gratified when it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935. Borah's fifteen-year fight for the recognition of the USSR ended in 1933 when Roosevelt opened diplomatic relations.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{domestic}} front, Minh Mạng continued his father's national policies of reorganising the administrative {{structure of the}} government. These included the construction of highways, a postal service, public storehouses for food, monetary and agrarian reforms. He continued to redistribute land periodically and forbade all other sales of land to prevent wealthy citizens from reacquiring excessive amounts of land <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> In 1840 it was decreed that rich landowners had to return {{a third of their}} holdings to the community. Calls for basic industrialisation and diversification of the economy into fields such as mining and forestry were ignored. He further centralised the administration, introduced the definition of three levels of performance in the triennial examinations for recruiting mandarins. In 1839, Minh Mạng introduced a program of salaries and pensions for princes and mandarins to replace the traditional assignment of fief estates.|$|E
