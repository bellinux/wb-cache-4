5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly <b>welded</b> materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the <b>welded</b> piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven.

5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the engine compartment, a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and <b>welded</b> hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and <b>welded</b> turrets).|$|E

Results show that the flat <b>welding</b> position led to better <b>weld</b> profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal <b>welding</b> position, which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten <b>weld</b> metals and the different escape routes for pores under different <b>welding</b> positions. Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the <b>welds,</b> too much porosity in horizontal laser <b>welds</b> led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of <b>welds.</b> Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both flat and horizontal <b>welding</b> positions, to reduce <b>weld</b> porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|R
