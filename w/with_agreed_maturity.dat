40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} decreasing MFI interest rates on household deposits and saving goals in 12 Monetary Union member countries in the years 2009 - 2015. It analyses tendencies in household deposits (overnight, <b>with</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>maturity</b> and redeemable at notice), and attempts to link them with certain household saving motives (target, retirement and precautionary). The paper identifies those deposit categories which appeared as sensitive to declining interest rates and indicates the Eurozone countries whose populations are expected to revise their savings plans. Precise implications are drawn for target saving motives of households in Austria, Cyprus and Malta. However, {{in the case of}} two other motives, the analysis does not conclude on the impact of decreasing MFI interest rates...|$|E
