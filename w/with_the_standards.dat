It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of ferrous metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.|$|E
5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux tapestry, {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E

25|$|Such {{conversion}} is {{not always}} done in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for character sets and encodings.

Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a prime rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°53′08″ as 49°53’08".|$|E

(the other was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Capitol Limited, which was instituted as an all-air-conditioned train only a week or so before the George Washington). New equipment was not built for this train; instead, older cars that were completely refurbished by Pullman and by C shops.

25|$|Even {{though the}} Reading was never again to regain its {{powerful}} {{position of the}} 1870s, it still was a very profitable and important railroad.

In keeping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of much larger railroads, The Reading embarked on many improvement projects which typically were not attempted by smaller railroads. This included triple and quadruple tracking many of its major routes, improving signaling and track quality, as well as expanding system capacity and station facilities.|$|E
25|$|In {{general in}} Ireland, water {{resources}} are abundant and 83% {{of drinking water}} comes from surface water. However, wastage levels were estimated at 800 million litres lost to leaks each day in 2015, while usage levels were calculated at 80 litres per capita per day in 2016. The quality {{of water from the}} public mains is usually quite high, with, for example, 98.9% of public water supplies complying <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for E. coli levels in 2004. However, the microbiological quality of some rural private group water schemes led to Ireland being cited in 2002 by the European Court of Justice for failing to abide by EU drinking water guidelines.|$|E

25|$|His {{strategy}} emphasised {{the importance}} of striking the first blow, but with an awareness that sunk ships could not easily be replaced, and would replace any officer who could not keep up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> he demanded. He gave lectures on naval strategy to which all officers were invited and once again encouraged his officers to bring ideas to him. He offered prizes for essays on tactics and maintained a large tabletop map room with models of all ships in the fleet, where all officers could come to develop tactics. A particular concern was the threat of torpedoes, which Germany had boasted would dispose of the British fleet, and the numerous French torpedo boats. Fisher's innovations were not universally approved, with some senior officers resenting the attention he paid to their juniors, or the pressure he placed on all to improve efficiency.|$|E

500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to digital, analog {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not have anything to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at {{a small fraction of the}} price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E

500|$|Prevention {{measures}} {{also exist}} on national and municipal levels. Recommendations by health professionals for lowering childhood exposures include banning {{the use of}} lead where it is not essential and strengthening regulations that {{limit the amount of}} lead in soil, water, air, household dust, and products. Regulations exist to limit the amount of lead in paint; for example, a 1978 law in the US restricted the lead in paint for residences, furniture, and toys to 0.06% or less. In October 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the allowable lead level by a factor of ten to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, giving states five years to comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards.</b> The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive limits amounts of lead and other toxic substances in electronics and electrical equipment. In some places, remediation programs exist to reduce the presence of lead when it is found to be high, for example in drinking water. As a more radical solution, entire towns located near former lead mines have been [...] "closed" [...] by the government, and the population resettled elsewhere, {{as was the case with}} Picher, Oklahoma in 2009.|$|E
