50|$|Dzongkha {{is usually}} {{described}} as having three tones: high, medium and low. However, in monosyllabic words, each tone can occur with two distinct contours. The high tone can be pronounced <b>with</b> either <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> or <b>a</b> falling contour, and the low tone can be pronounced <b>with</b> either <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> or rising-falling contour, the latter being a tone that rises to a medium level before falling again.|$|R
5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|Biffle led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the restart, and was passed on lap 77 by Jeff Gordon. Three laps later, Sadler made a pit stop <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> right rear tire. On lap 90 Kyle Busch took the lead, losing it to Gordon on the next lap. Earnhardt passed Gordon on lap 93, holding the lead for nine laps. Vickers took the lead on lap 102; Earnhardt's left front tire went flat the next lap, costing him a lap. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 107, with Vickers {{stopping}} on lap 108 and giving the lead to McMurray. After the pit stops, Vickers regained the lead.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery {{and was therefore}} unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat,</b> rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E

In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E

5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has {{the portrait of}} a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5000|$|The Lhasa dialect {{is usually}} {{described}} as having two tones: high and low. However, in monosyllabic words, each tone can occur with two distinct contours. The high tone can be pronounced <b>with</b> either <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> or <b>a</b> falling contour, and the low tone can be pronounced <b>with</b> either <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> or rising-falling contour, the latter being a tone that rises to a medium level before falling again. It is normally safe to distinguish only between the two tones because {{there are very few}} minimal pairs that differ only because of contour. The difference occurs only in certain words ending in the sounds m or ŋ; for instance, the word kham ( [...] , [...] "piece") is pronounced [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>flat</b> tone, whereas the word Khams ( [...] , [...] "the Kham region") is pronounced [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high falling tone.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small pilot project. De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the capital letter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> top. In 1499, Griffo recut the capitals, changing the appearance of the typeface slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E
5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E
