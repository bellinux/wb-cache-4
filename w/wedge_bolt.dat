Seven 2000 mm long columns were tested. Two columns were cast monolithically and named PO (original column) e PR (reference column). The other five columns were strengthened using a new 35 mm thick self-compacting concrete layer attached to the column face subjected to highest compressive stresses. Column PO had a 120 mm by 250 mm rectangular cross section and other columns had a 155 mm by 250 mm cross section after the strengthening procedure. Results show that the ultimate resistance of the strengthened columns was {{more than three times}} the ultimate resistance of the original column PO, indicating the effectiveness of the strengthening procedure.

40|$|Introduction. In {{production}} and repairs of pipeline armature grinding (debugging) is {{considered as one}} of the major technological operations. The main task is the providing of impermeability of breech-block. Whatever problems did not arise up in the achievement of impermeability, diagnosis of reason, practically, always one - the process of grinding in of fine surfaces is well not enough conducted. There is a large stake of truth in such answer, however, its not all and problem not only in grinding in. Grinding in is the finish operation of polishing of compressions and effective of its application depends not only on the exact observance of the recommended terms and modes of process. A major value of the the stages is the forming of quality and preceding to grinding in of the operation of treatment of compressions. If prior actions are executed off grade, then efficiency of realization of portable radio operations of grinding in will be. Materials and Methods. To the article a growing requirement is driven in the improvement of quality, increment of productivity and increment of longevity and reliability of machines and wares. The process of grinding (polishing) in allows to get the surfaces of processed details with high quality descriptions. Quality of implementation of finishing operation is estimated on following criteria: it is exactly in size, it is an error of form, they are indices of waviness of surface, indices of roughness of surface, the light reflect¬ing ability and quality descriptions of surface layer. For renewal of corps of <b>wedge</b> <b>bolt</b> by a main task providing of impermeability of breech-block. For its implementation hard requirements are produced, namely; a small roughness of surface, form and location. Thus fine surface of corps of <b>wedge</b> <b>bolt</b> must be homogeneous. Results. In order to attain the set roughness of fine surface, the trajectory of motion of instrument must have certain character. Because on this machine-tool a receipt of preset parameter of quality on all area of the processed surface is the main task of instrument accomplishing difficult rotatory motion that consists of: main motion is this rotation of disk on that instrument, is envisaged, directly from an engine; motion providing even treatment is this rotation of instrument about the axis. For the decision of this task the trajectory of motion of instrument is determined and a calculation is executed on determination of angulator of instrumental head. Discussion and Conclusions. Results conducted theoretical and experimental research method of treatment of sealing surfaces, and also developed on the basis of recommendation on the choice of the effective mode and conditions treatment allowed to modernize the technological process of the abrasive polishing. Thus, application of the modernized technology (finishing operation with difficult motion of instrument relatively processed surfaces) as compared to base provides the achievement of parameter roughness of Ra = 0, 08 micrometer. The obtained data testify the possibility of wide application method of finishing treatment of surfaces for the once-personal types of repair plug-forming...|$|E

40|$|Strengthening of {{reinforced}} concrete columns by jacketing {{is one of}} the most common structural rehabilitation techniques in Brazil. For adequate performance, it is necessary, among others, to avoid detachment of the new concrete layer (strengthening material) from the old concrete substrate when the strengthened member is again in service conditions. This paper describes the test results of eight {{reinforced concrete}} rectangular columns subjected to combined compression and one-axis bending to evaluate the efficiency of using sleeve <b>wedge</b> <b>bolts</b> across the new concrete/old concrete interface to avoid detachment. The strengthening technique, in this case, consists of adding a layer of self-compacting concrete to one face of the column. Two columns tested were monolithic and named PO (original column) e PR (reference column). The other six columns were strengthened using a new 35 mm thick self-compacting concrete layer attached to the column face subjected to highest compressive stresses. Column PO had a 120 mm by 250 mm rectangular cross section and its results gave information about column behavior without the use of strengthening. Column PR had a 155 mm by 250 mm rectangular cross section and its cross section dimensions matched the strengthened columns but it was cast monolithically. To improve bond conditions between the existing concrete and the new concrete, the concrete surface was roughened and the outermost aggregate was exposed using hydro jetting. Holes along the concrete surface were made to insert the <b>wedge</b> <b>bolts</b> responsible for increasing the bond between the two concrete surfaces. The difference among the six strengthened columns was the position and amount of bolts used. Results indicate that the position and amount of the bolts alters significantly the strength capacity of the columns, since premature rupture by concrete detachment was delayed...|$|R
30|$|The {{connecting}} element {{is the key}} part to make steel supports yieldable. The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the {{connecting element}} is very important. Any connecting element contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the connecting element, it will retract. According to the locking units, the connecting elements {{can be divided into}} <b>bolt</b> and <b>wedge</b> types. <b>Bolt</b> connecting elements can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with clamping plate, double U-shaped clamping plates, and pushing <b>bolt.</b> <b>Wedge</b> connecting elements can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|R

Two surfaces are joined tightly together with threaded <b>bolts,</b> <b>wedges,</b> clamps, or {{other means of}} applying high compressive force. Although a gasket, packing, or O-ring may be installed between the flanges to prevent leakage, it is sometimes possible to use only a special grease or nothing at all (if the mating surfaces are sufficiently precisely formed). Although flange fittings are bulky, they perform well in demanding applications such as large water supply networks and hydroelectric systems.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate side bearing clearance of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken side bearing <b>wedge</b> plate attachment <b>bolt,</b> which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the truck bolster bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.|$|R

2500|$|Along {{with the}} M1885 Remington-Lee and the M1892 Springfield, the M1895 Lee {{was one of}} the first {{infantry}} weapons adopted by U.S. forces to be equipped with a repeating action. [...] To operate the straight-pull mechanism, the operating handle is first pulled up at an angle to disengage the <b>bolt</b> and its <b>wedge</b> lock, then pulled sharply to the rear to extract and eject the spent case. [...] Pushing forward on the bolt handle strips a round from the magazine; as the bolt is slammed home, the <b>bolt's</b> <b>wedge</b> lock seats into place, the firing pin is cocked, and the fresh cartridge is seated in the chamber. [...] Once the M1895 is cocked, the rifle's bolt cannot be retracted unless the bolt-release lever is pushed downward. [...] This prevents opening of the action caused by an inadvertent bump or contact to the bolt handle. [...] The rifle has a safety located on the top of the receiver, which is released by pushing down with the thumb on the safety button.|$|R
50|$|The older {{of the two}} {{handlebar}} stem styles, quill types have been largely displaced as the industry standard on sport bikes. However, they remain standard on the majority of utility bikes, regardless of price, {{as well as on}} less expensive sport bikes and higher-end retro bikes. The quill stem requires the threaded steerer tube of the fork to extend up through the headset but not protrude beyond it. The quill stem fits down into the inside of the top of steerer tube and is held in place by either a wedge-shaped nut and bolt or a cone-shaped expander nut and bolt. In the case of a wedge-shaped nut, the bottom of the stem is cut diagonally to match the <b>wedge</b> and the <b>bolt</b> pulls the <b>wedge</b> against the stem to expand against the inside of the steerer tube and hold the stem in place. In the case of an expander nut, the bottom of the stem is cut perpendicular to its length and also has two slits cut parallel to its length. The cone-shaped expander nut is pulled upwards by the bolt causing the sides of the stem to spread and press against the inside of the steerer tube to hold it in place.|$|R
40|$|Bolted {{connections}} {{often fail}} by a shear plug or a splitting beneath the bolt caused by tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses as the <b>bolt</b> <b>wedges</b> {{its way through}} the wood. Pre-venting this type of failure would enhance the capacity and reliability of the bolted connection, thus increasing the over-all integrity of a timber structure and enabling wood to compete favorably with other engineering materials. This research investigated the use of fiberglass reinforcement to enhance the load-carrying capacity of bolted wood connec-tions. A series of specimens were prepared from standard 38 - by 89 -mm (nominal 2 - by 4 -in.) lumber from the Spruce–Pine–Fir lumber grouping. Matched specimens were reinforced with one, two, or three layers of bi-directional fiberglass cloth. Resulting test specimens were configured as a connection that was in accordance with current design specifications. A total of 80 single-bolt, double-shear connec-tions were tested; 40 parallel to grain and 40 perpendicular to grain. Results indicate that connection strength increases as the layers of fiberglass reinforcement increase. The largest in-crease occurred when adding the first layer to the nonrein-forced connection. Additional layers increased strength at a decreasing rate. The ultimate strength of a three-layer rein-forced connection was 33 percent greater than the nonrein-forced connection for parallel-to grain loading and more than 100 percent for perpendicular-to-grain loading. More impor-tantly for parallel-to-grain loading, the reinforcement changed the mode of failure from an abrupt, catastrophic type associ-ated with tension perpendicular-to-grain stresses to a ductile type associated with bearing stress...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [79]- 80). Printed wiring boards (PWBs) are extensively used {{in electronic}} systems. In many instances they {{are subjected to}} dynamic loads, for e. g., in aerospace and automotive applications. The behavior of PWBs to vibration and shock depends on {{the way they are}} mounted in electronic boxes. Hence, accurate modeling of the mounting is necessary to predict the dynamic behavior of PWBs. PWBs are typically supported using <b>wedge</b> locks, screws, <b>bolts</b> or edge connectors. Each mount type offers different boundary conditions. During analysis, the mounts are modeled appropriately to simulate the boundary conditions they offer. Edge connectors are usually modeled as simple supports. This thesis investigates the representation of an edge connector as a combination of linear and torsional spring (LTS) to better simulate the boundary condition. The stiffnesses of linear and torsional spring are calculated based on the geometry of the contact of the edge connector. The LTS model was tested on aluminum and fiberglass epoxy beams and plates mounted between two identical edge connectors. The validity of the model was checked by comparing the analytical behavior of the systems with their experimental behavior. These results were also compared with the behavior predicted by representing the edge connector as simple support to ascertain the gains achieved by modeling the edge connector as a combination of linear and torsional spring rather than as a simple support. Results show that the LTS model predicts the behavior of systems better than the simply supported model. It is also shown that the gains accrued by the use of LTS model depend on the width of the PWB used in the system. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Erosion and {{sedimentation}} is a prevalent water-quality {{issue in}} many Piedmont streams in Georgia (Landers and others, 2002). Typically, concentrations of suspended sediment {{are determined by}} collecting water samples and making physical measurements of sediment mass per unit volume in a laboratory setting. Particle-size distributions of individual samples also are typically per-formed in a laboratory. The U. S. Geological Survey is con-ducting an ongoing research project in Rockdale County, Georgia, and is using state-of-the-art instrumentation {{in an attempt to}} develop surrogate in situ, real-time measure-ments of particle-size and suspended-sediment concentra-tions in streamwater. The ultimate goal is to use in situ, real-time particle-size- and suspended-sediment concentra-tion measurements for computing continuous sediment loads. Instrumentation installed in the Yellow River near Mil-stead, Georgia, includes the Sequoia LISST™- 100 (Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissiometery) size distribution sensor (Fig. 1) and the SonTek® Argonaut-Shallow Water (SW) velocity meter 1 (Fig. 2). The LISST™- 100 is designed to report real-time in situ measurements of particle-size distribution (Gartner and others, 2001). The Argonaut-SW is a bottom-mounted, acoustic Doppler meter that is designed to report water velocity utilizing two vertically oriented beams and water-surface elevation using a third beam. The instrumented site is characterized by gradually-sloping, nonvegetated granite bedrock that controls flow of the river from baseflow to flood conditions. The grad-ual slope of the granite bedrock presented design and in-stallation obstacles to locating the instruments at the proper depth and outside of an area of recirculating back-flow. Site installation was designed to protect the instru-mentation from potentially-damaging flow-transported de-bris, premature wear, and vandalism, and to allow removal of the sensor for periodic maintenance during low to high baseflow conditions (Wagner and others, 2000). To meet these requirements, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe “de-ployment” tube was assembled and attached with steel <b>wedge</b> anchors <b>bolted</b> into the granite bedrock. ________ Figure 1. Sequoia LISST™- 100 before deployment at study site. The deployment tube was raised approximately 10 cen-timeters off the streambed to ensure that the LISST™- 100 would only measure entrained particles in the primary flow and not be skewed by larger sediments transported within the variable flow zone resulting from the bedrock channel. The LISST™- 100 sensing tip was exposed ap-proximately 10 centimeters beyond the end of the de-ployment tube such that the sensor would not be fouled by the collection of fine sediment within the interior of the deployment tube. To prevent excessive strain on the LISST™- 100 data cable, a light-gauge wire tether was connected to the instrument casing and anchored to the bedrock streambed. The degree of exposure of the sensor from the deployment tube end could be adjusted by chang-ing the length of the wire tether. The Argonaut-SW was designed to use Doppler tech-nology to measure stream velocity. The instrument func-tions by measuring the Doppler shift in reflected acoustic energy from entrained sediment particles within the water column. In order to use the Argonaut-SW to produce a surrogate for sediment concentrations, data compiled from the reflectivity function within the velocity computation are compared to actual sediment concentrations (Gray and others, 2003) measured from traditionally collected sam-ples. In theory, a larger measured reflectance will corre-spond to a greater sediment concentration. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.
