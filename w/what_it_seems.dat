5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b> The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; {{while the majority of}} the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b> Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E
25|$|The show {{is based}} on the theory that there is an {{alternate}} universe where every classic fairy tale character (new and old) exists—a world that has a loose connection to our world. On the night of her 28th birthday, bail bonds collector Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is reunited with Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore)—the son she gave up for adoption ten years previous—and takes him back to his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine—a place where nothing is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b>|$|E

500|$|Hendrick Vroom explains, [...] "the term Maya [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} as 'illusion,' {{but then it}} does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' {{does not mean that}} the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank: Chosen {{out of six}} {{unwanted}} pregnancies and {{the first}} child to be legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has {{a job in the}} insurance business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be. Robin Williams was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in [...] because Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do The Truman Show for $12 million. Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's improvisational skills, and the two became more interactive. The scene in which Truman declares [...] "this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy" [...] to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.|$|E
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi {{did not know what to}} do, as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he came up with the idea of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth back when he was a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. Trying to come up with a way for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial. The game's main theme was [...] "not everything is always <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> on the surface".|$|E

2500|$|Many reviewers {{have noted}} the {{difficulty}} of writing about Gone Girl, because so little {{in the first half}} of the novel is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be. In his Time review, Lev Grossman describes the novel as a [...] "house of mirrors." [...] He also writes [...] "Its content may be postmodern, but it takes the form of a thoroughbred thriller about the nature of identity and the terrible secrets that can survive and thrive in even the most intimate relationships." ...|$|E

The trio quickly get caught in a {{downward}} spiral of sex, closeted movie stars, hustlers, blackmail, secret videotape, a homophobic district attorney, a cute bartender, false fire alarms, car theft, impersonating a police officer, a sleazy public-access television host and a [...] "night with Oscar" [...] {{that has nothing to}} do with the Academy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Singapore {{wants to}} be water {{self-sufficient}} before the 2062 long-term water supply agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. According to analysis by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in 2003, Singapore would already be water self-sufficient by 2011 and [...] "the 'water threat' is less than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be". However, according to official forecasts water demand in Singapore is expected to double from 380 to 760 million gallons per day between 2010 and 2060. The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 {{and is expected to}} account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.|$|E

60|$|They {{looked at}} each other in silence for a second or two, and both their faces were very grim with the shadow of fear in them.

60|$|At {{first the}} murmurs {{conveyed}} nothing to him. Then suddenly a name caught his ear. Strowther was the name, and somehow it suggested something to him.

An unusual name, too. He could not help feeling that at one time he must have known it quite well.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the feminist {{movement}} in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, [...] "Kate's taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw's words 'altogether disgusting to modern sensibility'." [...] Addressing the relationship between A Shrew and The Shrew from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to be <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b> She argues A Shrew is an earlier version of The Shrew, but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that A Shrew was written by Shakespeare. She believes {{one of the reasons for}} this is because A Shrew [...] "hedges the play's patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in" [...] The Shrew. She calls A Shrew a more [...] "progressive" [...] text than The Shrew, and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that A Shrew is Shakespearean because [...] "the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in The Shrew." [...] She also points out that if A Shrew is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare [...] "may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials", something which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle between}} Sydney and Kormoran {{is seen as}} controversial: the disbelief that a {{modified}} merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined {{with the lack of}} Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false.
