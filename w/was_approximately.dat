5|$|James E. Rhoads, an {{astronomer}} at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined {{that it was not}} strongly beamed. Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 5×1050ergs (5×1043J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy <b>was</b> <b>approximately</b> 3×1050erg (3×1043J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
