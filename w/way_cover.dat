50|$|The {{remaining}} three men are asked by Muthuvel {{to clean the}} police station before leaving. The nature of Muthuvel's case is then revealed. The kidnapping was masterminded by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (D.C.P), under directions from the ruling political party of the state, to use K.K in court and take down the opposition party. Meanwhile, the Assistant Commissioner (A.C.P), {{who is on the}} payroll of the opposition party, convinces the D.C.P to play a double game and get 3 crores (30 million) rupees from the opposition for dropping the case. However, buying the D.C.P's bluff, the opposition party fears that K.K has given up their secrets and orders the A.C.P to interrogate him, during which he dies from the injuries sustained. A discussion ensues to figure out a <b>way</b> <b>cover</b> up the death as a suicide.|$|E
5000|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is New Zealand band Stellar's {{eleventh}} single, {{and their}} first single from their third album Something Like Strangers. This was Stellar's first new release {{in three years}} (excluding their cover of Tim Finn's Persuasion released for the She Will Have Her <b>Way</b> <b>cover</b> album). It was released as an exclusive digital download from the New Zealand digital music download site Digirama. Whiplash would be the 44th most downloaded song at Digirama for 2006. The song was first mentioned by Chris Van de Geer at Stellar's official message board in April 2005 as having been a track that was almost complete. It was also mentioned as a possible single for the album. However, in a later post by Chris in December he stated that the song had recently almost completely re-recorded and was set for release. The song was compared to Scottish blues rock band Texas' style by the New Zealand Herald.|$|E

40|$|Software testing often consumes up to 50 {{percent of}} the overall {{software}} costs. A large {{amount of time and}} money within the test process is spent due to incomplete, inconsistent or ambiguos informal specifications of the test objects. A more formal approach to the early phases of software development can reduce the error rate drastically and, in addition, can significantly improve the central testing activities like test case design and test evaluation. This paper presents an approach for generating test cases from formal specifications written in Z by combining the classification-tree method for partition testing with the disjunctive normal form approach. Firstly, a classification tree describing high level test cases is constructed from the formal specification of the test object. Then the high level test cases are further refined by generating a disjunctive normal form for them. The refined test cases obtained this <b>way</b> <b>cover</b> all specified aspects of the system explicitely and also [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Interactive theorem provers are tools {{designed}} for the certification of formal proofs developed by means of man-machine collaboration. Formal proofs obtained in this <b>way</b> <b>cover</b> a large variety of logical theories, ranging from the branches of mainstream mathematics, {{to the field of}} software verification. The border between these two worlds is marked by results in theoretical computer science and proofs related to the metatheory of programming languages. This last field, which is an obvious application of interactive theorem proving, poses nonetheless a serious challenge to the users of such tools, due both to the particularly structured way in which these proofs are constructed, and to difficulties related to the management of notions typical of programming languages like variable binding. This thesis is composed of two parts, discussing our experience {{in the development of the}} Matita interactive theorem prover and its use in the mechanization of the metatheory of programming languages. More specifically, part I covers: - the results of our effort in providing a better framework for the development of tactics for Matita, in order to make their implementation and debugging easier, also resulting in a much clearer code; - a discussion of the implementation of two tactics, providing infrastructure for the unification of constructor forms and the inversion of inductive predicates; we point out interactions between induction and inversion and provide an advancement over the state of the art. In the second part of the thesis, we focus on aspects related to the formalization of programming languages. We describe two works of ours: - a discussion of basic issues we encountered in our formalizations of part 1 A of the Poplmark challenge, where we apply the extended inversion principles we implemented for Matita; - a formalization of an algebraic logical framework, posing more complex challenges, including multiple binding and a form of hereditary substitution; this work adopts, for the encoding of binding, an extension of Masahiko Sato's canonical locally named representation we designed during our visit to the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Randy Pollack...|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} the extraordinary {{story of a}} Bolognese woman of the settecento. Laura Maria Caterina Bassi (1711 - 1778) defended 49 Theses at the University of Bologna on April 17, 1732 and was awarded a doctoral degree on May 12 of the same year. Three weeks before her defense, she was made {{a member of the}} Academy of Sciences in Bologna. On June 27 she defended 12 additional Theses. Several of the 61 Theses were on physics and other science topics. Laura was drawn by the philosophy of Newton {{at a time when most}} scientists in Europe were still focused on Descartes and Galen. This last set of Theses was to encourage the University of Bologna to provide a lectureship to Laura, which they did on October 29, 1732. Although quite famous in her day, Laura Bassi is unfortunately not remembered much today. This book presents Bassi within the context of the century when she lived and worked, an era where no women could attend university anywhere in the world, and even less become a professor or a member of an academy. Laura was appointed to the Chair of experimental physics in 1776 until her death. Her story is an amazing one. Laura was a mother, a wife and a good scientist for over 30 years. She made the transition from the old science to the new very early on in her career. Her work was centered on real problems that the City of Bologna needed to solve. It was an exciting time of discovery and she was at the edge of it all the <b>way.</b> <b>Cover</b> Image: Courtesy of Bononia University Press, from Marta Franceschini’s  Laura Bassi Minerva bolognese, illustrated by Alessandro Battara, 2011 © Bononia University Press, 2011 Portrait of Laura Maria Caterina Bassi at the Palazzo Poggi in Bologna.

The little girl is Laura as a child, a unique girl who lives in a world of her own, where the objects she fantasizes about are not toys or dolls but scientific instruments, tools, geometric shapes. In her mind, she sees the world she will live in, as a woman who will shape history; she is already living and sparking, almost like magic blended with science...|$|E
