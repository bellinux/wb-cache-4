40|$|Germanium {{quantum dots}} in a silicon matrix {{can be used}} in {{so-called}} intermediate band solar cells. Such solar cells have efficiency limits exceeding that of the conventional single junction solar cells. In this master project germanium quantum dots will be fabricated on silicon substrates using electron beam (e-beam) deposition in NTNU Nanolab. A systematic <b>study</b> <b>will</b> be performed, where the substrate temperature during deposition and the amount of material deposited will be varied. Both germanium and silicon samples will be fabricated. The structural properties of the samples <b>will</b> be <b>studied</b> using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and the composition of the samples <b>will</b> <b>studied</b> by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. The thickness of the films <b>will</b> be <b>studied</b> using a profilometer. Finally, the density of quantum dots and their size distribution will be determined using atomic force microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Review question/{{objective}} The {{objective of}} this review is to establish the effect of modifying dietary sodium intake in normotensive subjects. More specifically, the objectives are to identify the effect of reducing or increasing sodium intake on blood pressure in normotensive subjects with systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg, {{and the effect of}} sodium reduction or supplementation on arterial function in subjects with baseline systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review <b>will</b> consider <b>studies</b> that include adult subjects with systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg and studies conducted in community settings (for example, free living populations) and controlled conditions (for example, metabolic ward, hospital and study centre). This review <b>will</b> exclude <b>studies</b> that include subjects prescribed antihypertensive or vasoactive medications. Types of interventions This review <b>will</b> consider <b>studies</b> that evaluate dietary sodium intake for equal to or greater than four weeks duration. This review <b>will</b> consider <b>studies</b> that include two study arms comprising of different levels of sodium intake. This review <b>will</b> consider <b>studies</b> that modify sodium intake via dietary modification, salt reduction, and/or salt supplementation. Types of outcomes This review <b>will</b> consider <b>studies</b> that include the following outcome measures: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, pulse wave analysis, and flow mediated dilatation by Doppler ultrasound.

25|$|The {{reported}} apparitions of the Virgin Mary to {{six children}} in Medjugorje in 1981 have received significant attention. The Our Lady of Medjugorje messages are published and distributed worldwide and often emphasize five key elements: Daily prayer of the Holy Rosary, Fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, Daily {{reading of the}} Bible, Monthly Confessions and Holy Communion. The reports of visions at Medjugorje were vigorously opposed by the responsible bishop, Bishop Pavao Žanić of Mostar-Duvno. A Commission appointed by him to investigate the apparitions {{did not come to}} a definitive conclusion and left the site open to further study.

Rhombur seeks out a companion from the Bene Gesserit order and is matched with a young woman named Tessia who gives him {{a new sense of}} drive and purpose. After receiving a plea for help from C'tair Pilru, an Ixian rebel, Rhombur begins supplying the Ixian resistance with limited aid, though his attempts are greatly hindered by the Emperor's Sardaukar.

After the child's birth, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her role as Leto's concubine, wanting the Duke to marry her so that their son can succeed his father someday. Kailea's lady-in-waiting, Chiara, is actually a Harkonnen agent sent to poison Kailea's mind against Leto.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, the Sihanaka were {{estimated}} to number around 200,000. Families are hierarchical, with parents exercising authoritarian {{control over their}} children. [...] Sihanaka {{men and women have}} significant autonomy in deciding when to marry and whether to divorce. [...] Marriages are disallowed between siblings, cousins, and direct ascendents. To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members. Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to say the word for it. Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who can afford a formal education <b>will</b> <b>study</b> at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices.
