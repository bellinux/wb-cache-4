50|$|Since the refresh process {{caused the}} same pattern to {{continually}} reappear on the display, {{there was a need}} to be able to erase previously written values. This was normally accomplished by writing to the display just beside the original location. The electrons released by this new write would fall into the previously written well, filling it back in. The original systems produced this effect by writing a small dash, which was easy to accomplish without changing the master timers and simply producing the <b>write</b> <b>current</b> for a slightly longer period. The resulting pattern was a series of dots and dashes. There was a considerable amount of research on more effective erasing systems, with some systems using out-of-focus beams or complex patterns.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve the performance of the read-write head process in Hard disk drive manufacturing with respect to Bit Error Rate (BER). With the preliminary survey, the process capability index (Cpk) of BER was 0. 72 which is less than the one side acceptable value at 1. 25. To improve Cpk of BER, five phases of Six sigma approach are applied starting from define, measure, analyze, improvement and control phases. At 95 % confidence, thermal protrusion, <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> amplitude, <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> overshoot, number of defects on media and writing head width are the significant factors for Bit Error Rate due to their p-value less than 0. 05. Since the number of defects and writing head width are uncontrollable factors, the experiment are designed and performed based of general factorial design with three levels of each controllable factor. At 5 % significance level, there are the interaction effects between the thermal protrusion and the <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> amplitude as well as the interaction affects between the <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> amplitude and the <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> overshoot. With the general linear model (GLM), the suggested values for the thermal protrusion, <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> amplitude and <b>writing</b> <b>current</b> overshoot are 35 DAC, 10 mA and 9 mA, respectively. Under the suggested condition, Cpk of BER is increased from 0. 72 to 2. 38 and the percentage of defective due to head related failure is reduced from 21. 85 % to 9. 86 %...|$|R

5000|$|A newer technique, spin {{transfer}} torque (STT) or spin transfer switching, uses spin-aligned ("polarized") electrons {{to directly}} torque the domains. Specifically, if the electrons flowing into a layer {{have to change}} their spin, this will develop a torque that will {{be transferred to the}} nearby layer. This lowers the amount of current needed to write the cells, making it about the same as the read process. There are concerns that the [...] "classic" [...] type of MRAM cell will have difficulty at high densities due to the amount of current needed during writes, a problem that STT avoids. For this reason, the STT proponents expect the technique to be used for devices of 65 nm and smaller. [...] The downside is the need to maintain the spin coherence. Overall, the STT requires much less <b>write</b> <b>current</b> than conventional or toggle MRAM. Research in this field indicates that STT current can be reduced up to 50 times by using a new composite structure. However, higher speed operation still requires higher current.|$|E
40|$|With the {{scaling of}} CMOS technology, the {{proportion}} of the leakage power to total power consumption increases. Leakage may account for almost half of total power consumption in high performance processors. In order to reduce the leakage power, there is an increasing interest in using nonvolatile storage devices for memory applications. Among various promising nonvolatile memory elements, spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is identified {{as one of the most}} attractive alternatives to conventional SRAM. However, several design challenges of STT-MRAM such as shared read and <b>write</b> <b>current</b> paths, single-ended sensing, and high dynamic power are major challenges to be overcome to make it suitable for on-chip memories. To mitigate such problems, we propose a domain wall coupling based spin-transfer torque (DWCSTT) device for on-chip caches. Our proposed DWCSTT bit-cell decouples the read and the <b>write</b> <b>current</b> paths by the electrically-insulating magnetic coupling layer so that we can separately optimize read operation without having an impact on write-ability. In addition, the complementary polarizer structure in the read path of the DWCSTT device allows DWCSTT to enable self-referenced differential sensing. DWCSTT bit-cells improve the write power consumption due to the low electrical resistance of the <b>write</b> <b>current</b> path. Furthermore, we also present three different bit-cell level design techniques of Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) for alleviating some of the inefficiencies of conventional magnetic memories while maintaining the advantages of spin-orbit torque (SOT) based novel switching mechanism such as low <b>write</b> <b>current</b> requirement and decoupled read and <b>write</b> <b>current</b> path. Our proposed SOT-MRAM with supporting dual read/write ports (1 R/ 1 W) can address the issue of high-write latency of STT-MRAM by simultaneous 1 R/ 1 W accesses. Second, we propose a new type of SOT-MRAM which uses only one access transistor along with a Schottky diode in order to mitigate the area-overhead caused by two access transistors in conventional SOT-MRAM. Finally, a new design technique of SOT-MRAM is presented to improve the integration density by utilizing a shared bit-line structure. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Blocking {{temperature}} written magnetic {{random access}} memory element test structures of various sizes and tunnel barrier resistance area products were fabricated in order to study the dependence of writing efficiency and tunnel junction integrity on the thermal environment of the memory element and tunnel junction resistance area product. The test structures were programmed using a CPP writing mode, where the device is heated by passing a small current through the tunnel junction. The device is then field cooled to set the direction of an IrMn/NiFeCo storage layer. Quasi-static <b>write</b> <b>current</b> was measured as a function of resistance area product and for underlayers with differing thermal conductivities. Linear fits to the size dependent <b>write</b> <b>current</b> data suggest that properly designed submicron bits can be written quasi-statically at < 100 µA. <b>Write</b> <b>current</b> for a fixed thermal environment was found to depend inversely on resistance product, but too large a resistance area product causes the tunnel barriers to fail before the memory element can be heated above the blocking temperature of the storage layer. In addition, if the thermal conductivity between the magnetic tunnel junction and substrate is too small, the magnetic tunnel junction will fail before the blocking temperature is reached, even at very low resistance area product values. Proper device design should thus optimize cell thermal resistance and tunnel junction resistance for both reliability and minimum power consumption.

40|$|Spin Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is a {{promising}} candidate for Last Level Cache (LLC) {{due to high}} endurance, high density and low leakage. One of the major disadvantages of STTRAM is high write latency and <b>write</b> <b>current.</b> Additionally, the latency and current depends on the polarity of the data being written. These features introduce major security vulnerabilities and expose the cache memory to side channel attacks. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel side channel attack model where the adversary can monitor the supply current of the memory array to partially identify the sensitive cache data that is being read or written. We propose several low cost solutions such as short retention STTRAM, 1 -bit parity, multi-bit random write and constant current write driver to mitigate the attack. 1 -bit parity reduces the number of distinct <b>write</b> <b>current</b> states by 30 % for 32 -bit word and the current signature is further obfuscated by multi-bit random writes.

40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} scales down, the leakage {{power in}} high-performance microprocessor can exceed 40 % {{of the total}} power consumption. In {{order to reduce the}} leakage power consumption, {{there is a need to}} explore nonvolatile on-chip memory and logic designs. To address the aforementioned issue, this research presents two designs: spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) cache and spin Hall effect based nonvolatile flip-flop (SHE-NVFF). STT-MRAM, in which a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is used as the storage element, has become a leading candidate for on-chip caches due to its desirable memory characteristics such as nonvolatility, near zero standby leakage power and compatibility with CMOS fabrication process. However, retention/write/read failures in STT-MRAM negatively impact the memory yield, density and dynamic energy consumption. We propose a device-circuit-architecture co-design methodology, which jointly considers MTJ retention capability, STT-MRAM bitcell characteristics and various architectural techniques (error correcting codes, scrubbing and invert-coding) at different levels of design abstraction so as to maximize memory density while meeting the yield requirement and improving the energy consumption. We also propose an MTJ-based NVFF for power gating architecture. The proposed NVFF exploits SHE for fast and low power data backup into MTJs before the power is turned off. Owing to the high spin injection efficiency of SHE, the <b>write</b> <b>current</b> for backup operation is lower than that in previous work using STT. Due to the low <b>write</b> <b>current</b> requirement, we re-use the cross-coupled inverters in the slave latch to perform the backup operation, resulting in low area overhead. ...|$|E
