5|$|The 2009 Giro ended, {{as it had}} the {{previous}} year, with an individual time trial. The course <b>was</b> <b>flat,</b> though the road did twist in several places.|$|E
5|$|The {{very short}} prologue {{contained}} three sharp corners. The first two kilometers were slightly uphill, {{the third one}} was slightly downhill and the rest <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
5|$|This stage <b>was</b> <b>flat,</b> {{with only}} a climb to short {{elevation}} near the end. A preview predicted a sprint finish, but a late attack decided the stage.|$|E
5000|$|Assume that f : X &rarr; Y and g : Y &rarr; Z are morphisms of schemes. Assume {{furthermore}} that f <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at x in X. Then g <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at f(x) if {{and only}} if gf <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at x. [...] In particular, if f <b>is</b> faithfully <b>flat,</b> then g <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> or faithfully flat if {{and only if}} gf <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> or faithfully flat, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose B <b>is</b> <b>flat.</b> Then the {{sequence}} is pure exact if {{and only if}} C <b>is</b> <b>flat.</b> From this one can deduce that pure submodules of <b>flat</b> modules <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|R
25|$|If A is pure in B and B <b>is</b> <b>flat,</b> then A and C <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} (after points) {{objects in}} Euclidean space <b>are</b> <b>flats,</b> or Euclidean subspaces of lesser dimension. Points <b>are</b> 0-dimensional <b>flats,</b> 1-dimensional <b>flats</b> <b>are</b> called (straight) lines, and 2-dimensional <b>flats</b> <b>are</b> planes. -dimensional <b>flats</b> <b>are</b> called hyperplanes.|$|R
5000|$|Let [...] be a {{morphism}} of schemes. We {{say that}} [...] <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> {{at a point}} [...] if the induced morphism [...] yields an exact functor [...] Then, [...] <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> if it <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at every point of [...] It <b>is</b> also faithfully <b>flat</b> if it <b>is</b> a surjective morphism.|$|R

5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} <b>was</b> <b>flat,</b> containing, per tradition, one early {{categorized}} climb. It ended with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia in Milan preceding a mass sprint finish.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the Cretaceous, {{slightly}} more than 80 million years ago, the region's landscape <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> and monotonous; a condition that persisted during most of the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|Pickaplop - Pickaplop is {{a planet}} which, while verdant, <b>is</b> indeed {{literally}} <b>flat.</b> Everything seems to <b>be</b> <b>flat,</b> as though made of cardboard. Even the inhabitants <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b> The residents <b>are</b> quite round if inflated. Pickaplop <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> {{because of a}} strange phenomenon which occurs when the night arrives. The night lasts but two seconds and literally falls, deflating anything below it.|$|R
25|$|Every {{projective}} module <b>is</b> <b>flat.</b> The converse <b>is</b> {{in general}} not true: the abelian group Q is a Z-module which <b>is</b> <b>flat,</b> but not projective.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} {{need not}} <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> at just one point. Trivially, constant functions on ℝ <b>are</b> <b>flat</b> everywhere. But there are other, less trivial, examples.|$|R
25|$|Many {{scholastic}} commentators on Aristotle's On the Heavens and Sacrobosco's Treatise on the Sphere unanimously {{agreed that}} the earth is spherical or round. Grant observes that no author who had studied at a medieval university thought that the earth <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 17th century, {{the idea}} of a spherical Earth, now {{considerably}} advanced by Western astronomy, ultimately spread to Ming China, when Jesuit missionaries, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that the Earth <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> and square.|$|E
25|$|Volvo {{reported}} strong {{sales from}} all three core global regions. Sales in Europe rose 10% in 2015 to 269k, representing over 50% of total global volume. Volvo’s revival in the US gained momentum, with sales up 24% in 2015, while China <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> amid a challenging sales environment, but sales were up 11% in the fourth quarter.|$|E

5000|$|Eugenie Scott {{called the}} group {{an example of}} [...] "extreme Biblical-literalist theology: The earth <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> because the Bible says it <b>is</b> <b>flat,</b> {{regardless}} of what science tells us".|$|R
25|$|The {{upper and}} lower wings were of equal span and chord; on the first {{aircraft}} (named Shrimp) the lower wing had a slight dihedral, while the upper wing <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> On the two later aircraft, both wings had equal dihedral. All three were fitted with folding wings (which Shorts had developed and patented in the years 1913 -1915).|$|E
25|$|Belief {{in a flat}} Earth {{continued}} into the 5th century BC. Anaxagoras (c. 450 BC) agreed that the Earth <b>was</b> <b>flat,</b> and his pupil Archelaus believed that the flat Earth was depressed in the middle like a saucer, {{to allow for the}} fact that the Sun does not rise and set at the same time for everyone.|$|E
25|$|In {{his private}} life Walls's great passion <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> racing. In 1927 he {{established}} a stable {{at his home in}} Ewell, Surrey, with up to twenty-five horses at any one time. Over the next twenty years his horses won about 150 races, including the 1932 Derby won by his April the Fifth. The expense of the stables, together with a generally lavish lifestyle, was a severe drain on Walls's finances.|$|E

25|$|The summit itself <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> Spirit took a 360 degree {{panorama}} in real color, {{which included}} the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons Phobos and Deimos {{in order to determine}} their orbits better. On sol 656 Spirit surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.|$|E
25|$|McQueen {{was offered}} the lead in Raise the Titanic, but felt that the script <b>was</b> <b>flat.</b> He was under {{contract}} to Irwin Allen after appearing in The Towering Inferno and offered a part in a sequel in 1980, which he turned down. The film was scrapped and Newman was brought in by Allen to make When Time Ran Out, which was a box office bomb. McQueen died shortly after passing on The Towering Inferno 2.|$|E
25|$|The {{area of the}} Sheikh Sa'ad {{defenses}} <b>was</b> <b>flat</b> and featureless. The Ottoman {{positions were}} well camouflaged. There was no elevated ground to help provide observation posts for the advancing Tigris Corps. As Younghusband's troops advanced up both banks of the Tigris, they began to run into Ottoman emplacements around 10:30a.m. Without waiting to concentrate his forces, or for Aylmer to arrive {{with the rest of}} the Tigris Corps, Younghusband ordered his troops on both sides of the river to attack.|$|E
