25|$|Three sets of grades {{exist in}} Swedish {{universities}} and university colleges. Some universities have introduced a seven-grade scale (A-F, Fx), that {{similar to the}} ECTS scale, but with a criterion-referenced grading instead of relative grading. The most common scale is a three-grade scale that consists of U (Underkänd in Swedish, fail), G (Godkänd, pass) and VG (Väl godkänd, pass with distinction). In this set VG is the highest. The other grade set consists of (U, 3, 4, 5) where 5 is the highest. This grade set is normally given in courses within technical professional degrees. Finally there are some courses, within two systems of grading, in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only get G (pass) or U (fail). For instance, for a one semester thesis (specialized level) in Computer Science for a Master's degree at some institutions one can only get the grade G (pass) or fail, while for an equivalent thesis at other institutions one can also receive the grade VG.|$|E

Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets."

Not listed is the 1851 proof three-cent silver, of which only one is known, which was last sold in 2012 for $172,500, and once formed part of the Louis Eliasberg collection. Flynn and Zack theorize that this was the specimen viewed by Hodge in approving Longacre's design, as there is no record of its return to the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E

500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the record as one [...] "in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary Afrofunk synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic". Michael Kulp of The Daily Collegian commented that the album deserves the tag [...] "classic" [...] like each of the band's three previous full-length releases, while John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times, suggested that it confirmed TalkingHeads' position as [...] "America's most venturesome rock band". Sandy Robertson of Sounds praised the record's innovative nature, while Billboard wrote, [...] "Just about every LP Talking Heads has released {{in the last four years}} has wound up on virtually every critics' best of list.

In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot".

500|$|The set {{containing}} Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans {{fitted with}} 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8inches apart. Ambrose {{collaborated with the}} production team to institute twenty-five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I-beams. Ambrose proclaimed that {{the flexibility of the}} trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added: [...] "We also had four 20Ks and a few more T-12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close-ups, we often used Barger-Baglite six- and three-light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60- and 90-degree honeycomb grids for control." [...] In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the color spectrum of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. [...] "We used a lot of batten strips with 100-watt household bulbs," [...] noted Ambrose. [...] "The bulbs are so close they're almost touching, so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> slide diffusion frames or egg crates. We call them 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Immanuel Kant, {{a central}} figure of the Age of Enlightenment, {{likewise}} claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: [...] "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection." [...] The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: [...] "act only according to that maxim by <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{at the same time}} will that it should become a universal law." [...] Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; [...] "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature." ...|$|E
