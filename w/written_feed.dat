40|$|Ingredient {{quality is}} the {{foundation}} upon which an animal ration is built. Therefore, establishing an ingredient quality evalua-tion program is an essen-tial component of a successful feed processing operation. Routine evalua-tion of finished feed quality will help ensure that proper ingredient storage, proportioning, grinding, and mixing were performed. This bulletin contains information pertaining to ingredient specifications, suggestions on which feed ingredient and finished feed properties should be analyzed, types of assays to perform, and how to interpret lab results. The first step in evaluating ingredients and finished feed quality involves collecting a representative sample {{as described in the}} bulletin, Sampling: Procedures for Feed (Herrman 2001). Ingredient Specifications Ingredient specifications are essential to a quality assurance program. Specifications serve as the basis from which purchasing agreements are <b>written,</b> <b>feed</b> rations are formulated, and ingredient inspections are performed.

2500|$|Physical {{therapists}} {{can assist}} patients in maintaining {{their level of}} independence through therapeutic exercise programmes. [...] One recent research report demonstrated a gain of 2 SARA points (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) from physical therapy. In general, physical therapy emphasises postural balance and gait training for ataxia patients. General conditioning such as range-of-motion exercises and muscle strengthening would also be included in therapeutic exercise programmes. [...] Research showed that spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) patients [...] with a mild stage of the disease gained significant improvement in static balance and neurological indices {{after six months of}} a physical therapy exercise training program. Occupational therapists may assist patients with incoordination or ataxia issues through the use of adaptive devices. Such devices may include a cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair for those with impaired gait. Other devices are available to assist with <b>writing,</b> <b>feeding,</b> and self care if hand and arm coordination are impaired. A randomised clinical trial revealed that an intensive rehabilitation program with physical and occupational therapies for patients with degenerative cerebellar diseases can significantly improve functional gains in ataxia, gait, and activities of daily living. Some level of improvement was shown to be maintained 24 weeks post-treatment. Speech language pathologists may use both behavioral intervention strategies as well as augmentative and alternative communication devices to help patients with impaired speech.|$|R

50|$|While he was <b>writing</b> <b>Feed,</b> Anderson took in younger, pop-culture {{oriented}} media, such as Seventeen, Maxim, and Teen Vogue. He {{used these}} media sources to convey an accurate teenage voice, {{but even more}} depleted and abbreviated. He's used this method many times, including reading 18th century novels during his writing of The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing. A shy person, Anderson has stated that he greatly prefers writing to public speaking. As a writer he does not shy from taking on difficult questions and deeper, more mature concepts and themes. Unlike many other young-adult writers, Anderson views the characters he creates simply as figures moving and acting on his terms. The only exception to this view of his characters has been his main character in The Astonishing Life, Octavian Nothing. Anderson faces unique challenges in writing for the young adult market, especially concerning the topics he chooses. He has heavily researched the time periods of his novels in order to accurately portray his characters. Similarly to Feed, Anderson had to put himself in the shoes of a young person from a different time period when he wrote The Astonishing Life. However, this novel challenged him to explore the dialect of a time period that had already happened, rather than a time period {{that has yet to}} come. Anderson pointed out that he actually tends to dislike his books after he's finished with them, a declaration that has been seen as modest; he feels distanced from the work and is usually eager to move on to another project. This is his reasoning behind writing in so many different genres. Anderson has also indicated that he hopes to not only continue writing for young adults and children, but also to write for an adult audience in the future.|$|R

In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester. The first edition of Stern's pioneering textbook The Principles of Human Genetics was published in 1949, which he said in an autobiographical sketch from 1974 he <b>wrote</b> to <b>feed</b> the needs of premedical students.
