5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus.

5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} impacts of joint energy and output prices {{uncertainties}} on the inputs demands in a mean-variance framework. We find that an increase in expected output price <b>will</b> surely <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> risk averse firm to increase the inputs’ demand, while an increase in expected energy price <b>will</b> surely <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> risk averse firm to decrease the demand for energy and increase the demand for non-risky inputs. Further, increasing the variance of energy price <b>will</b> necessarily <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> risk averse firm to decrease the demands for the non-risky inputs. Furthermore, we investigate the two cases with only uncertain energy price and only uncertain output price. In the case with only uncertain energy price, {{we find that the}} uncertain energy price has no impact on the demands for the non-risky inputs. ...|$|R

5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> body of {{a vehicle}} to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning {{that it can be}} tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves in a way that <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E

5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E

5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
5|$|When he proves {{unable to}} defeat Data-Sora himself, Pete infects Data-Riku's code with bugs and forces him to fight, putting the datascape {{in danger of}} being totally corrupted. Seeing no alternative, Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku from inside, an act which <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> datascape to reset if he succeeds, wiping his memories. The {{debugging}} process also activates the bug responsible for the data's corruption, which takes the form of Sora's Heartless. Data-Sora destroys the bug while Mickey and the others are returned to their world by Data-Riku before the reset occurs. In a scene exclusive to HD 2.5 ReMix, after Maleficent and Pete take their leave, Maleficent speaks with Pete about the Book of Prophecies, an ancient artifact capable of transcribing events that have yet to take place and even conjuring them, including entire worlds; she resolves to find it, believing it may hold a connection with the datascape and the journal.|$|E
5|$|When players {{encounter}} {{enemies in}} either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a small heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks unleashed by the opposing monster {{in a similar}} fashion to a bullet hell shooter. As the game progresses, new elements are introduced, such as colored obstacles, and boss battles which change the way players control the heart. Players may choose to attack the enemy, which involves timed button presses. Killing enemies <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> player to earn EXP (in turn increasing their LOVE) and gold. They can use the ACT option to perform various actions, which vary depending on the enemy. If the player uses the right actions to respond to the enemy, or attacks them until they have low HP (but still alive) they can choose to spare them and end the fight without killing them. In order for some boss encounters to be completed peacefully, the player is required to survive until the character they are facing has finished their dialogue. The game features multiple story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to kill or spare their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear the game without killing a single enemy.|$|E

5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories {{so that he could}} remember the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is prepared to fight to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this <b>will</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
