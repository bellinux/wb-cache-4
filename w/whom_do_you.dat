We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us.

It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> talk and who do you hold accountable?"

And I think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories."
