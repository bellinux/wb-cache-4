Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} {{how to use}} Mixed Integer Linear Programming to optimize guessing strategies for algebraic cryptanalysis of EPCBC- 96. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to obtain practical attacks for the cipher with up to 3 rounds. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to demonstrate attacks that are faster than brute force for up to 5 rounds. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to identify a class of weak keys for which the attack is faster than brute force for up to 6 rounds...|$|R

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to use archival {{pieces from}} Van Cleef & Arpels, which {{came with a}} {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There {{were a couple of}} times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E
25|$|We had {{transparent}} isolation booths onstage {{in which}} each of them--there were four people all together--you know, Herb Caen, Allen Ginsberg, et cetera, et cetera--we were able to broadcast and switch the signals from the various booths onto a series of speakers. In the meantime, we were projecting a series of slides which came from the Verbal American Landscape. Those had been chosen by me--I didn't do the photography; Ivan and Stewart Brand did the photography. We borrowed some closed-circuit television equipment, so there were television images. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to switch the whole thing. There were people in costume--it was a very elaborate affair.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Jack Roush, {{owner of}} Roush Racing, offered Kvapil {{a seat in}} the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil {{replaced}} Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5's and 12 Top 10's. He finished the season sixth in the driver point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.|$|E

500|$|Abraham Benrubi, more {{noted for}} his work as Jerry Markovic on the NBC {{hospital}} drama ER, was cast by Rick Millikan to play Big Mike. Benrubi's appearance on the show coincided {{with one of the}} final George Clooney episodes filmed for ER and the NBC production staff was hesitant to allow him to appear on the show, for fear of muddling the already-narrow production schedule. Millikan later explained, [...] "there was a small window—he had a few days off—and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to squeeze him in there." ...|$|E

Millikan explained that, [...] " [...] had been on my list to put into the show since Day One.

500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to go back}} and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded I guess so. It was creepy because {{it was supposed to}} be underwater, so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [...] because the three of us, it was almost like being on stage. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to really work off of each other and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show.|$|E
500|$|During {{his later}} years Borchgrevink lived quietly. In 1929, the Parliament of Norway awarded him a pension of 3,000 Norwegian kroner. In 1930 came belated {{recognition}} from London—the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron's Medal, proclaiming that {{the magnitude of the}} difficulties overcome by Borchgrevink had initially been underestimated: [...] "It was only after the work of Scott's Northern Party... that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to realise the improbability that any explorer could do more in the Cape Adare district than Mr Borchgrevink had accomplished. It appeared, then, that justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the Southern Cross expedition, which had been carried out under the British flag and at the expense of a British benefactor." ...|$|E

Mowry and Hall left The Game in 2012 after Hall accepted a lead role in the crime drama television series Ray Donovan. Mowry left the show when Melanie's role was slated to become [...] "less important" [...] in comparison to previous seasons.

500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion.
