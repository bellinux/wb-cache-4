40|$|Sprag <b>handle</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} for general applications in which conventional pawl-and-ratchet wrenches and sprag and cam "clickless" wrenches are now used. Sprag <b>handle</b> <b>wrenches</b> are so named because they would include components that would function both as parts of handles and as sprags (roller locking/unlocking components). In comparison {{with all of the}} aforementioned conventional wrenches, properly designed sprag <b>handle</b> <b>wrenches</b> could operate with much less backlash; in comparison with the conventional clickless <b>wrenches,</b> sprag <b>handle</b> <b>wrenches</b> could be stronger and less expensive (because the sprags would be larger and more easily controllable than are conventional sprags and cams) ...|$|R
40|$|Wrench {{converts}} gripping {{action of}} hand to rotary motion without imparting reactive moments or forces on part being turned or on operator. Wrench should {{be useful in}} undersea operations and other delicate work where reactive forces and torques have to be controlled. In design for valve tightening, tool resembles cross between conventional spanner wrench and pilers. One handle engages valve body; second handle has ratchet pawl that engages toothed coupling ring on perimeter of valve handle. When operator squeezes <b>wrench</b> <b>handles,</b> valve handle rotates with respect to valve body...|$|R

Invented by Snap-on Incorporated, composite ring gear has been already successfully applied to mechanical engineering area. More specifically Snap-on is producing a gear mechanical system commonly known as ratchet <b>wrench</b> <b>handle,</b> which incorporates Snap-on composite ring gear as the key element of the system.|$|E

It {{can be used}} in tight spaces and will not damage adjacent structures. Wrench consists of central handle and 2 independent jaws with serrated teeth.

40|$|Torque-wrench {{extension}} {{makes it}} easy to install and remove fasteners that are beyond reach of typical wrenches or are located in narrow spaces that prevent full travel of <b>wrench</b> <b>handle.</b> At same time, tool reads applied torque accurately. Wrench drive system, for torques up to 125 inch-pounds, uses 2 standard drive-socket extensions in aluminum frame. Extensions are connected to bevel gear that turns another bevel gear. Gears produce 1 : 1 turn ratio through 90 degree translation of axis of rotation. Output bevel has short extension that is used to attach 1 / 4 -inch drive socket...|$|E

40|$|A wrench is {{described}} that is usable where limited access normally requires an open-end wrench, but which has substantially the high-torque capacity and small radial clearance {{characteristics of a}} closed-end wrench. The wrench includes a sleeve forming a nut-engageable socket with a gap in its side, and an adaptor forming a socket with a gap in its side, the adaptor closely surrounding the sleeve and extending across {{the gap in the}} sleeve. The sleeve and adaptor have surfaces that become fully engaged when a <b>wrench</b> <b>handle</b> is applied to the adaptor to turn it so as to tighten a nut engaged by the sleeve...|$|E

60|$|At once Burleigh {{saw what}} had {{happened}} and what it might mean for him. He had left the hall door open after his visit to the front, and some wandering bird of the night had entered the house. No need for him to go now. No need to hide either from the hangman's rope or the felon's cell. The fool above had saved him. He turned and ran up stairs again just as the prisoner in his furious efforts to escape <b>wrenched</b> the <b>handle</b> from the door.|$|R
60|$|The car {{had begun}} to move. I <b>wrenched</b> at the <b>handle,</b> but I found it held on the inside with a grip which even I could not move.

60|$|The whistle sounded at last, {{the train}} began to glide slowly {{away from the}} almost deserted platform.

He tugged at the <b>handle,</b> <b>wrenched</b> it open, and was {{preparing}} for a flying leap when an inspector seized him. There was an altercation, a violent struggle--the man was left upon the platform. Reist drew a long breath of relief as he settled down in his corner.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with hazardous materials control are numerous and complex. One of these problems involves selecting hand protection which will resist permeation {{for the duration of}} the exposure while maintaining sufficient levels of dexterity and tactility so that the worker can safely and efficiently perform the required task. This study investigated the effect of nine glove combinations on manual dexterity. These included three single glove and six double glove combinations plus the bare hand condition. The subjects performed a nut-bolt-washer assembly-dissassembly task using the Bennett Hand Tool Dexterity Test apparatus. The task required the use of a screw driver, two sizes of open-end wrenches, and an adjustable <b>wrench,</b> along with <b>handling</b> the bolt, nut, and washer while performing the assembly-disassembly task for three different bolt, nut, and washer sizes (1 / 2 ", 5 / 16 ", 1 / 4 "). The response variables measured in the experiment were the time to complete each task and number of errors committed during each task. any of the items handled. model and the Duncan's Multiple Range Test. analysis. The results of the analyses showed that gloves increased the average completion time by 15 to 37 %.

40|$|The task of {{this study}} was to examine post exodontia {{dynamics}} that lead to the use of an equine dental spacer on cheek teeth. Research involved the conceptualization of a spacer, which should negate a variety of undesirable consequences resulting from tooth removal. The application of the spacer should be non traumatic and easy for the practitioner to handle as well as economically feasible for the owner. Additionally, the newly designed spacers were to be tested on the patient. The cited literature is extensive and provided detailed information, for example, on how to approach the sedated standing patient, which can be manipulated in the mouth for a longer period of time. Information on cheek tooth replacement was limited and almost no practical solutions for the treatment of pathological consequences of a cheek tooth gap without general anaesthesia were found. Moreover, indications of long term effects in the dentition after cheek tooth removal appeared to be incomplete and the potential of specific tooth replacement was not discussed. Dentition radiographs of 70 patients (42 were studied clinically within this paper) and 4 sculls served to examine whether teeth move after exodontia, which teeth move, where teeth move, reason for movement, the rate of speed at which teeth move, and lastly the width of movement. Additionally, the factors influencing movement and the pathologies created by these movements were investigated. Radial calculations on the skulls, the radiographs and the clinical examinations which included dental gap impressions revealed that in all cases studied (P 2, P 3, M 1, M 2; n = 66) the teeth adjacent to the gap tipped quickly in the first few months, while later the rate of tipping declined. The tipping process terminated when teeth met and led to pathological conditions in all patients of the study. According to the requirements, dental spacers were constructed from horse teeth, urethane plugs and from metal. The spacers were tested on skulls, slaughter heads, and patients. While initially spacers had to be therapeutically effective, practicable, easy and gently to use as well as cost effective, demands on the spacer evolved to be additionally applicable for tipping correction, stable to anchor, usable on the standing patient and medically unobjectionable. Moreover the evolution of the final spacer design necessitated the use of a Dremel tool for application, whereas the prior designs were applied with adhesive, intraoral steel pins, and activated with a custom made long <b>handled</b> <b>wrench.</b> The use of the Dremel tool as a drill in the last design was to bore holes in the adjacent teeth to apply the spacer. The spacer was inserted into the holes by spring-loaded nipples and then activated by adjusting a threaded mechanism to the correct gap width. Thereby, the idea of a fast and easy adaptable plastic spacer which can be pressed in the tooth gap had to be renounced. With most models it was difficult to insert the spacer into the maxilla without causing trauma to the soft tissues. Although model 13 b (adjusting screw without tooth pieces, base piece and side piece; passive fixation through spring-loaded nipples, which snap into tooth borings) could not be tested due to the lack of an appropriate dental drill, preliminary results indicated that only this model may meet all criteria for a dental spacer...|$|R
