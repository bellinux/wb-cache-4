Compared to drilled horizontal <b>drains,</b> <b>wick</b> <b>drains</b> can be significantly deformed without ruptur-ing. They resist clogging, {{and they can be}} installed quickly and economically by workers with no pre-vious training. Since 1998, more than 170 drains, totaling more than 2, 600 m (8, 600 ft) in length, have been installed at eight sites in Missouri, Colorado, and Indiana. At three of the sites, drains were installed at a density and layout considered to be appropriate for full-scale stabilization: 27 to 44 drains were driven at each site, averaging 15 to 20 m (50 – 70 ft) in length. A method was developed to accurately estimate the groundwater-table profile after drain installation, and computer slope-stability analysis using this method showed significant in-creases (10 – 40 percent) in factors of safety after drain installation. The limitations of the methodology should be recognized: it may be applied in specific situations requiring relatively short (< 30 – 45 m, or < 100 – 150 ft) drains in materials ranging from soft to very stiff (up to 30 blows/ft in standard penetra-tion tests).

The later method also takes into consideration the use of <b>wick</b> <b>drains</b> as part of the design procedure. These methods are popular because of their simplicity and the reduced number of required parameters, but they are unable to predict the soil movement and the pore pressure generation or dissipation.

These main shortcomings of simplified analytical procedure can be overcome by using physical modeling and numerical techniques.|$|R

40|$|Liquefaction {{is one of}} {{the primary}} causes of lateral spreading, {{failures}} of bridge foundations, embankments, and ports and harbor facilities during earthquakes (e. g., 1964 Alaska earthquake, 1995 Kobe earthquake). Soil densifi cation techniques using vibro-stone column (Figure 1 a) and deep dynamic compaction (Figure 2 a) are proven ground improvement methods for liquefaction mitigation in loose saturated sands containing less than 15 % non-plastic silts and less than 2 % of clay particles (FHWA, 2001, Mitchell et al., 1995, Andrus and Chung, 1995).

40|$|The use of {{vertical}} drains {{to improve the}} performance of potentially liquefiable ground during earthquakes has received increased attention {{over the last two}} decades.

The code includes equations describing a vertical drain with a non-constant "equivalent hydraulic conductivity" which more accurately describes the flow properties of perforated pipes and <b>wick</b> <b>drains,</b> and head losses due to horizontal flow into the drain. It can also model the presence of a reservoir directly connected to the drain, allowing the accumulation of the water discharged by the drain element as well as head losses in the reservoir itself. In contrast, most analyses used in practice assume the water level in the drain is at the ground surface and therefore all flow into the drain escapes. The accumulation of water within the drain, however, can lead to a significant retardation of flow into the drain, causing an increase in the predicted pore pressures developed during the earthquake...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with constructing highway embankments over soft compressible soil (i. e., large settlements, embankment instability and the {{long period of time}} required for consolidation of the foundation soil) has lead to the development and/or extensive use of many of the ground improvement techniques used today. <b>Wick</b> <b>drains,</b> surcharge loading, and geosynthetic reinforcement, have all been used to solve the settlement and embankment stability issues associated with construction on marginal soils. However, when time constraints are {{critical to the success of}} the project, owners have resorted to another innovative approach: geosynthetic reinforcement column supported embankments. Column supported embankments (CSE) consist of vertical columns that are designed to transfer the load of the embankment through the soft compressible soil layer to a firm foundation. The load from the embankment must be effectively transferred to the columns to prevent punching of the columns through the embankment fill creating differential settlement at the surface of the embankment. If the columns are placed close enough together, soil arching will occur and the load will be transferred to the columns. In order to minimize the number of columns required t...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The State Highway 3 Cobham Bridge in Wanganui was {{assessed}} for its performance in earthquakes, {{and ability to}} provide access for traffic across the Wanganui River after large events. Detailed assessment of the bridge using a displacement based assessment approach enabled a cost effective strengthening design to be developed. The retrofit works comprised strengthening the plastic hinge region {{of two of the}} piers for shear and ground improvement at the abutments to reduce damage from liquefaction and consequent lateral spreading. Ground improvement comprised an optimum combination of stone columns, vertical drains, and ground replacement. Stone columns and <b>wick</b> <b>drains</b> were installed in a triangular shaped area to economically protect each abutment. The stone columns strengthen the ground against instability and provide drainage in earthquakes. The vertical drains facilitate dissipation of pore pressures generated during stone column vibro-compaction and provide additional drainage capacity during earthquakes. The stone columns were constructed by drilling temporarily cased holes and compacting gravel in place using vibration of the casing and a central probe, as the casing is withdrawn, to maximise drainage capacity and strength. The strengthening measures adopted were designed to provide an acceptable level of performance, that is quick reinstatement of access after major events, cost effectively. ...|$|R

The dam {{is located on the}} Waiwarawara Stream close to State Highway One at Ruakaka. The stream catchment area is relatively small (3. 9 km 2) and a viable water supply in the Northland climate required seepage losses to be minimised. The valley floor comprises a 15 m deep sequence of soft alluvial silts and clays interbedded with permeable sand and gravel lenses. The foundation conditions raised a number of issues for the design of the dam, including seepage; construction stability; settlement; seismic stability; and liquefaction. These were addressed by a range of design provisions that included: <b>wick</b> <b>drains,</b> cement-bentonite slurry cut-off wall, wide berms on the upstream and downstream shoulders, highly plastic core, staged construction, and instrumented monitoring of foundation performance.

This paper provides a brief description of both test embankments consisting of sandfill with a height of 3. 0 m and a ground area 26 × 36 m 2 with slopes 1 : 2.

40|$|In 2003, Crenshaw and Santi {{developed}} {{a method for}} calculating average piezometric heads between horizon-tal drains in a slope. The method relies on drain flow rates, slope geometry, and soil hydraulic conductivity. The corrugated shape of groundwater profiles between drains and {{the departure of the}} groundwater surface from the drain near its uphill end were verified using laboratory-scale physical and computer modeling. In 2007, a study was conducted seeking to confirm these findings using field-scale modeling. The test site con-sists of a 2 H: 1 V (2 horizontal: 1 vertical), 30 3 12 ft (9. 1 3 3. 7 m) concrete slope representing low-perme-ability bedrock. Five perforated pipes embedded in the concrete are used to simulate base-flow recharge. The concrete was covered with a lean clay, and two <b>wick</b> <b>drains</b> were installed at a spacing of 8 ft (2. 4 m). Fifty standpipe piezometers were installed to measure ground-water profiles between and along drains. Measurements were taken during recharge and drawdown events. The test was repeated with a clayey sand. Test results generally confirm the findings of Crenshaw and Santi, with some localized variations in groundwater profiles. The variations are most likely due to factors such as heterogeneous soil properties, the development of preferential pathways, boundary effects, etc. Field-testing also yielded additional information about the behavior of drained slopes that may be useful for future slope-stability projects. As a result of this research, recommendations for using Crenshaw and Santi’s method to estimate piezometric heads between short, high-angle sub-horizontal drains in shallow landslides for use in slope-stability analyses are provided...|$|R

Additionally parameters for Terzaghi and Darcy consolidation models were derived as well: consolidation coefficient, permeability and strain dependent permeability strain factor. Based on applied field loading increments predictions were made. Test results of both embankments will be shown including predictions.

40|$|Landslides {{are very}} common within the {{residual}} soils and sedimentary rock of Southern Indiana. A {{substantial amount of}} the Indiana State budget is spent on road repair and maintenance from damage caused by landslide. The landslide remedial technique frequently applied by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is the excavation and backfill method, which in most instances is successful. However, in many cases more liberal landslide treatments may be applied that would arrest movement, provide a sufficient safety factor, and at a lower cost. The objective {{of this study is}} to propose economically feasible landslide remedial methods that may be used as an alternative to the excavation and backfill method. “Unconventional” landslide remedial methods describe stabilization methods that are not commonly practiced in Indiana, and for which design criteria are not available. Unconventional stabilization methods will likely have the greatest benefit applied to relatively small landslides requiring constant maintenance because these landslides are in a delicate equilibrium. Relatively modest improvements in stability may be sufficient to stop persistent movements. Proposed landslide remedial methods are conventional horizontal <b>drains,</b> driven horizontal <b>wick</b> <b>drains,</b> driven recycled plastic pins, railroad rail piles, lime piles, biotechnical remediation, and gravity mass retaining systems. A landslide inventory containing various attribute information of geologic environment and landslide geometry was compiled. The inventory includes 284 landslides with attribute information of each individual landslide. Landslide locations were entered into a geographic information system (GIS) database along with geographic and geologic information. The constructed GIS database allowed easy correlation of landslide occurrence with geologic features. It is concluded that landslide occurrence is a function of topography and bedrock geology. Suitability of landslide stabilization methods depends upon the characteristics of the sliding mass, which include the geologic environment and geometry of the landslide. A landslide classification scheme was developed which recommends suitable remedial solutions based upon the landslide classification.

The Northern Region Materials Section (NRMS) conducted three separate geotechnical investigations {{as part of a}} location study in 1990, 1991, and 2004. In 1990, DOT&PF drilled 45 test holes for the "L 1 " proposed route. From Station 10 + 00, where the "L 1 " alignment deviates south of the existing road, it passes over silt, colluvium, ice and chert bedrock with some areas containing existing fill. Proposed cuts along the "L 1 " alignment are as deep as 34 ft, and fills are up to 70 ft high. Where drilled, soils were frozen starting at 1 to 15 ft below the surface, and continued frozen {{to the bottom of the}} hole at depths of 43 ft. The test holes typically had a minimum of one ft thick zone of 25 percent or more visible ice within the first five ft below the organic mat. Most of the test holes had an organic mat layer of 0. 5 ft. Where detected, the bedrock was weathered, and was first noted at depths ranging from 3. 5 to 40 ft below the surface. Many of the test holes didn't reach bedrock. "L 1 " was determined to be an unacceptable route as a result of poor soils and extensive ice. Based on this exploration, the decision was made to investigate another alternative. In 1991, a second alignment, "Lz" was staked in the field, and 29 test holes were drilled north of [...] the "L 1 " alignment see pages 12 to 17. The majority of the material that we found consisted of silt, organic silt, colluvium, and ice over chert bedrock. Drill hole 91 - 16 intercepted the water table at 8 ft. From Station 28 + 00, the proposed "L 2 " alignment deviates from existing road and passes over silt, colluvium, ice, and chert bedrock. There is a 0. 5 ft organic mat along this alignment. The cuts that are required for the proposed route are as deep as 35 ft, while the fill [...] sections are up to 50 ft high. Most of the test holes are frozen from 1. 5 ft below the surface to [...] the depth drilled, however in test hole 91 - 16 frozen material wasn't detected until 11. 5 ft below the surface. Based on this exploration, alignment "L 2 " is recommended as the preferred [...] alternative. Due to high ice content in thaw-susceptible soil, NRMS is proposing three options for constructing a road. The first option is to build a road using conventional methods over the [...] proposed route and expect a great deal of future maintenance due to settlement resulting from [...] thawing of ice-rich soils. The second option is to build the road using the Air Convection [...] Embankment method to keep the foundation soils frozen. The third option is to clear and strip [...] the organic mat on the proposed route, then allow for the soil to thaw for a few years before [...] constructing the new road. This option could include some "rough cutting" to allow frozen, ice [...] rich foundation soils to thaw. <b>Wick</b> <b>drains</b> could be placed to facilitate foundation soil consolidation and drainage during embankment construction.
