25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement {{and that makes it}} a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought {{that it would be better}} suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> give it away." ...|$|E

He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} orchestral works {{originally}} composed for {{the concert hall}} commenced with the 3-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russel Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto {{is dedicated to the}} memory of Glass's father: [...] "His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. (...) So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one that my father would have liked." [...] Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

Meanwhile, Irving Hoffman, a New York press agent and columnist for The Hollywood Reporter, had befriended Scott and tried to introduce her to people who could help her. On September 29, 1943, Hoffman held a birthday party at the Stork Club—Scott had turned 21. By happenstance or design, Wallis was also at the club that night. Hoffman introduced Scott to Wallis, who arranged for an interview the following day. When Scott returned home, she found a telegram offering her the lead for the Boston run of The Skin of Our Teeth. Miriam Hopkins was ill. Scott sent Wallis her apologies, cancelling the interview. Scott recalled [...] "On the train up to Boston, to replace Miss Hopkins, I decided I {{needed to make the}} name more of an attention-grabber.

2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E
