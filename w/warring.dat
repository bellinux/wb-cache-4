5|$|Belt hook: The belt hook was a {{fastener}} used in China. Belt hooks {{date to the}} 7th century BC in China, and were made with bronze, iron, gold, and jade.

5|$|Qin Shi Huang, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Qin dynasty, {{established}} China's imperial system of government in 221 BC after unifying the Seven <b>Warring</b> States through conquest, bringing to an end the <b>Warring</b> States period. For a time, the rulers of the <b>warring</b> states claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050 – 256 BC), yet the Zhou kings' political power and prestige was {{less than that of}} later Chinese emperors. The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BC. However, following Han's victory over Chu, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both <b>warring</b> parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the <b>warring</b> parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E

5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration.

5|$|During a siege on {{the kingdom}} of Doma, Kefka grows {{impatient}} with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain {{the trust of the}} protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the <b>Warring</b> Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad—the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the <b>Warring</b> Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the <b>Warring</b> Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the <b>Warring</b> Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.|$|E

5|$|In August 1989, Sihanouk {{stepped down}} as the President of FUNCINPEC and was succeeded by Nhiek Tioulong. At the same time, Ranariddh was made the Secretary-General of the party. In September 1990, the four <b>warring</b> Cambodian factions reached an {{agreement}} to form the Supreme National Council (SNC), an organisation designed to oversee Cambodia's sovereign affairs in the United Nations on an interim basis. The SNC consisted of twelve members from the four <b>warring</b> Cambodian factions, with two seats going to FUNCINPEC. Sihanouk negotiated to become the 13th member of the SNC, a proposal which Hun Sen initially rejected, but later acceded after Sihanouk relinquished his FUNCINPEC party membership in July 1991. Sihanouk was elected {{as the chairman of}} the SNC, and the SNC seats under FUNCINPEC's quota were filled up by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.

5|$|On April 10, 1972, the Yinqueshan Han Tombs were accidentally {{unearthed}} by {{construction workers}} in Shandong. Scholars uncovered {{a collection of}} ancient texts written on unusually well-preserved bamboo slips. Among them were The Art of War and Sun Bin's Military Methods. Although Han dynasty bibliographies noted the latter publication as extant and written by a descendant of Sun, it had previously been lost. The rediscovery of Sun Bin's work is regarded as extremely important by scholars, both because of Sun Bin's relationship to Sun Tzu {{and because of the}} work's addition to the body of military thought in Chinese late antiquity. The discovery as a whole significantly expanded the body of surviving <b>Warring</b> States military theory. Sun Bin's treatise is the only known military text surviving from the <b>Warring</b> States period discovered in the twentieth century and bears the closest similarity to The Art of War of all surviving texts.|$|E
