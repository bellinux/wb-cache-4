5000|$|Her 2012 novella, The Daylight Gate, {{based on}} the 1612 Pendle Witch Trials, was {{published}} on the 400th anniversary of the trials. The novellas main character, Alice Nutter, is {{based on the}} real-life woman of the same name. The Guardians Sarah Hall describes the work: [...] "the narrative voice is irrefutable; this is old-fashioned storytelling, with a sermonic tone that commands and terrifies. Its also like courtroom reportage, sworn witness testimony. The sentences are short, truthful - and dreadful ... Absolutism is Wintersons forte, and its the perfect mode to verify supernatural events <b>when</b> they occur. <b>Youre</b> not asked to believe in magic. Magic exists. A severed head talks. A man is transmogrified into a hare. The story is stretched as tight as a rack, so the readers disbelief is ruptured rather than suspended. And if doubt remains, the texts sensuality persuades" ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The games inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason its never really bothersome. Most of the time youre so caught up in the game that you dont notice it, and <b>when</b> you do, <b>youre</b> willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Darks character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|R

She stated [...] "Twenty years later, the lithe songwriter embraces the same hybrid notion of introspection and sonics that are anything but singer/songwriterly. and Bright Lights embodies relief, release and refuge ... Without being florid or cosmic, she beckons to a far more graceful, honest world." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe praised the albums [...] "crisp, tuneful, warm, and sincere" [...] tone, {{as well as the}} production of the album. However, she was critical on the albums songwriting stating that songs [...] "Celebrity" [...] and [...] "Win and Win" [...] were [...] "clunkers". Nick Levine from BBC Music was equally positive saying the album brought out a more [...] "mellow Alanis Morissette". However, he was critical on the production saying it was [...] "too slick". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said the album [...] "is as soothing as a Sunday afternoon nap or a warm bath: its music for <b>when</b> you know <b>youre</b> right where you want to be." [...] At American Songwriter, Eric Allen called the album an [...] "intelligent and inspiring" [...] work that has [...] "winning results". The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski found [...] "Havoc And Bright Lights remains fearless and vibrant despite its shortcomings."
