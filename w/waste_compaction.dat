50|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>compaction</b> is {{the process}} of {{compacting}} waste, reducing it in size. Garbage compactors and waste collection vehicles compress waste so that more of it can be stored in the same space. Waste is compacted again, more thoroughly, at the landfill to conserve valuable airspace and to extend the landfill's life span. A side effect of this is that important items, like evidence in a crime, may be difficult to recover from the garbage. Due to reduced oxygenation, biodegradation of organic waste is also slowed.|$|E

This is because waste collection companies frequently charge by volume or require use of standard-volume containers, and compaction allows more waste to fit in the same space. Trash compactors are available for both residential and commercial use. Compacting garbage after it is collected allows more waste to fit inside the collection vehicle, meaning fewer trips to a dump or transfer station are required. The collection company also incurs lower landfill fees, if the landfill charges by volume 1.|$|E

Dynamic compaction is the practice of dropping a heavy weight to compact material that has been placed in the subsurface for disposal. B- 25 s placed in Engineered Trench number 1 contain low-level radioactive <b>waste.</b> Dynamic <b>compaction</b> of buried B- 25 s is an option that could mitigate subsidence of the cap that is eventually constructed over an engineered trench disposal site. The objective of numerical modeling of the Engineered trench system was to evaluate the response of B- 25 Containers to dynamic compaction, eventually incorporating dynamic compaction behavior with various degrees of B- 25 corrosion. Understanding the structural behavior of buried B- 25 s over time is important for anticipating and dealing with subsidence. Subsidence may compromise the long-term integrity of the caps placed over the buried waste to limit downward water and contaminant movement through the material...|$|R

40|$|Compaction {{characteristics}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) were determined in the laboratory and in the field {{as a function of}} moisture content, compactive effort, and seasonal effects. Laboratory tests were conducted on manufactured wastes using modified and 4 X modified efforts. Field tests were conducted at a MSW landfill in Michigan on incoming wastes without modifications to size, shape, or composition, using typical operational compaction equipment and procedures. Field tests generally included higher efforts and resulted in higher unit weights at higher water contents than the laboratory tests. Moisture addition to wastes in the field was more effective in winter than in summer due to dry initial conditions and potential thawing and softening of wastes. The measured parameters in the laboratory were γdmax-mod= 5. 2 kN/m 3, wopt-mod= 65 %, γdmax- 4 x mod= 6. 0 kN/m 3, and wopt- 4 x mod= 56 %; in the field with effort were γdmax-low= 5. 7 kN/m 3, wopt-low= 70 %; γdmax-high= 8. 2 kN/m 3, and wopt-high= 73 %; and in the field with season were γdmax-cold= 8. 2 kN/m 3, wcold= 79. 5 %, γdmax-warm= 6. 1 kN/m 3, and wwarm= 70. 5 %. Soil compaction theory was reasonably applicable to wastes with the exception that the Gs of waste solids increased with compactive effort resulting in steep degree of saturation curves and low change in wopt between efforts.

30|$|Coal wastes is {{the main}} {{pollution}} source in mining areas. The paper six studied an alternate technology for control of sulfate and chloride discharge. This research evaluates the hypothesis that co-disposal of CCPW (Coarse Coal Processing Waste) and FCPW (Fine Coal Processing <b>Waste)</b> with appropriate <b>compaction</b> can result in improved geochemical and geotechnical environments that will minimize acid mine drainage (AMD) formation and SO 42 − and Cl− discharges. Addition of ground limestone (ag-lime) to the mix was also evaluated as a drying agent and for improvement in overall geochemistry by buffering higher pH values within the coal waste.

25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard <b>waste)</b> to reduce <b>compaction</b> of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the analysis {{is to examine the}} potential for lid ejection from a vented transuranic (TRU) waste drum due to pressure buildup caused by the deflagration of hydrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside the drum. In this analysis, the AICC pressure for a stoichiometric mixture of VOCs is calculated and then compared against the experimental peak pressure of stoichiometric combustion of propane and hexane in a combustion chamber. The experimental peak pressures of propane and hexane are about 12 percent lower than the calculated AICC pressure. Additional losses in the drum are calculated due to venting of the gases, drum bulging, <b>waste</b> <b>compaction,</b> and heat losses from the presence of waste in the drum. After accounting for these losses, the final pressures are compared to the minimum observed pressure that ejects the lid from a TRU drum. The ejection pressure of 105 psig is derived from data that was recorded for a series of tests where hydrogen-air mixtures were ignited inside sealed TRU drums. Since the calculated pressures are below the minimum lid ejection pressure, none of the VOCs and the hydrogen (up to 4 percent) mixtures present in the TRU waste drum is expected to cause lid ejection if ignited. The analysis of potential VOC deflagrations in a vented TRU drum can be applied across the DOE-Complex since TRU waste is stored in drums throughout the complex...|$|E
30|$|The writers {{suggest that}} the {{landfill}} is still able to receive MSW based {{on a number of}} factors. Firstly, it is possible that before the renaissance of LAWMA, and considering losses by decomposition, compaction and recycling, only about half of the projected 736, 500 tonnes/year were emplaced before 2008 (amounting to a total MSW in place of 5, 523, 750 tonnes in the intervening 15  years). Also, the current depth in parts hovers around 15  m. Settlement, overlying pressure of the <b>waste</b> and further <b>compaction</b> by machines, may also have increased the density of the deposited waste streams with time. Bhide [8] estimated a MSW density of 800  kg/m 3 after dumping. Given the plethora of factors, it is plausible to arrive at a density of about 2200  kg/m 3 bringing the capacity of the landfill to 13, 860, 000 tonnes. The Olusosun currently receives about 1, 700, 000 tonnes/year of MSW. Given that the quantity of soil added periodically is marginal and discounting for recycling and decomposition, only about 60  % of these may be emplaced in the landfill. In addition, the operators of the landfill are at liberty to marginally extend the elevation of the sites to accommodate more wastes provided proper capping is done and other sanitary conditions met. Therefore, it is possible for the Olusosun landfill operations to subsist for upward of another ten years.|$|R

40|$|<b>Waste</b> {{distribution}} and <b>compaction</b> at the working face of municipal waste landfills releases mercury vapor (Hg 0) to the atmosphere, {{as does the}} flaring of landfill gas. Waste storage and processing before its addition to the landfill also {{has the potential to}} release Hg 0 to the air if it is initially present or formed by chemical reduction of HgII to Hg 0 within collected waste. We measured the release of Hg vapor to the atmosphere during dumpster and transfer station activities and waste storage before landfilling at a municipal landfill operation in central Florida. We also quantified the potential contribution of specific Hg-bear-ing wastes, including mercury (Hg) thermometers and fluorescent bulbs, and searched for primary Hg sources in sorted wastes at three different landfills. Surprisingly large fluxes were estimated for Hg losses at transfer facilities (100 mg/hr) and from dumpsters in the field (30 mg/hr for 1, 000 dumpsters), suggesting that Hg emissions occur-ring before landfilling may constitute a significant fraction of the total emission from the disposal/landfill cycle and a need for more measurements on these sources. Reducing conditions of landfill burial were obviously not needed to generate strong Hg 0 signals, indicating that much of the Hg was already present in a metallic (Hg 0) form. Attempts to identify specific Hg sources in excavated and sorted waste indicated few readily identifiable sources; because of effec-tive mixing and diffusion of Hg 0, the entire waste mass acts as a source. Broken fluorescent bulbs and thermometers in dumpsters emitted Hg 0 at 10 to 100 g/hr and continued to act as near constant sources for several days...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis presents a model to predict the effects of overburden pressure on the formation of leachate within municipal solid waste landfills. In addition, it estimates the compaction and subsequent settlement that the waste will undergo due to the force of material placed above it. The leachate model is based on a mass balance on water, expressed within finite elements constructed throughout the landfill. It incorporates the effects of gas generation, field capacity, and precipitation in determining the leachate produced within each element. The model then migrates this leachate through the landfill. The compaction routine utilizes Elastic Theory analysis to determine the forces which exist within the landfill due to overburden pressure. Empirical relationships are then used to calculate a level of compaction associated with these force, and the elements are deflected accordingly. The model is designed to be incorporated with a previously constructed gas generation and movement simulation, known as GasPro, which was developed by Stallard (1990) and an automatic gridding and filling scheme constructed by Beck (1994). Both the leachate production and the <b>waste</b> <b>compaction</b> portions of the model were found {{to be sensitive to the}} sequence in which the waste material was placed in the landfill...|$|E

The research effort of this subcontract {{is divided into}} four areas: (1) process and equipment development, (2) efficiency improvement, (3) characterization and analysis, and (4) environmental, health, and safety. As {{part of the process}} development effort, the output of the pilot-production facility was increased. More than 6, 200 8 -ft{sup 2 } CdS/CdTe plates were produced during Phase 1 [...] more than double the total number produced prior to Phase 1. This increase in pilot-production rate was accomplished without a loss in the PV conversion efficiency: the average total-area AM 1. 5 efficiency of sub-modules produced during the reporting period was 6. 4 %. Several measurement techniques, such as large-area measurement of CdS thickness, were developed to aid process improvement, and the vapor-transport deposition method was refined. CdTe thickness uniformity and reproducibility were improved. From a population of more than 1, 100 plates, the mean standard deviation within a plate was 7. 3 % and the standard deviation of individual-plate averages was 6. 8 %. As part of the efficiency-improvement task, research was done on devices with thin-CdS and buffer layers. A cell with 13. 9 % efficiency was produced on a high-quality substrate, and higher than 12 % efficiency was achieved with a cell with no CdS layer. A number of experiments were performed as part of the characterization and analysis task. The temperature dependence of CdTe modules was investigated; the power output was found to be relatively insensitive (< 5 %) to temperature in the 25 to 50 C range. As part of the characterization and analysis task, considerable effort was also given to reliability verification and improvement. The most carefully monitored array, located at the NREL, was found to have unchanged power output within the margin of error of measurement (5 %) after 5 years in the field. The first round of National CdTe Team stability tests were concluded. One back-contact formulation resulted in cells that increased in efficiency as a result of 9, 700 hours of light soaking. As part of the environmental, health, and safety task, an emissions survey was performed for the pilot-production facility. For production of 360 modules/day, it was predicted that the cadmium emissions would be only 0. 015 % of the level that would require any permitting; however, methanol emissions may require permitting if anticipated process changes are not implemented.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate experimental determination of specific gravity (Gs) of municipal solid waste (MSW). Water pycnometry, typically used for testing soils was adapted for testing MSW using a large flask with 2000 mL capacity and specimens with 100 – 350 g masses. Tests were conducted on manufactured waste samples prepared using US waste constituent components; fresh wastes obtained prior and subsequent to compaction at an MSW landfill; and wastes obtained from various depths at the same landfill. Factors that influence specific gravity were investigated including <b>waste</b> particle size, <b>compaction,</b> and combined decomposition and stress history. The measured average specific gravities were 1. 377 and 1. 530 for as-prepared/uncompacted and compacted manufactured wastes, respectively; 1. 072 and 1. 258 for uncompacted and compacted fresh wastes, respectively; and 2. 201 for old wastes. The average organic content and degree of decomposition were 77. 2 % and 0 %, respectively for fresh wastes and 22. 8 % and 88. 3 %, respectively for old wastes. The Gs increased with decreasing particle size, <b>compaction,</b> and increasing <b>waste</b> age. For fresh wastes, reductions in particle size and compaction caused occluded intraparticle pores to be exposed and waste particles to be deformed resulting in increases in specific gravity. For old wastes, the high Gs resulted from loss of biodegradable components that have low Gs as well as potential access to previously occluded pores and deformation of particles due to both degradation processes and applied mechanical stresses. The Gs was correlated {{to the degree of}} decomposition with a linear relationship. Unlike soils, the Gs for MSW was not unique, but varied in a landfill environment due both to physical/mechanical processes and biochemical processes.

The Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE) and the Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) provided a measure of the microgravity environment of the Space Shuttle Columbia. The OARE provided investigators with quasi-steady acceleration measurements after about a six hour time lag dictated by downlink constraints. SAMS data were downlinked in near-real-time and recorded on-board for post-mission analysis. An overview of the mission is provided as are brief discussions of these two accelerometer systems. Data analysis techniques used to process SAMS and OARE data are discussed Using a combination of these techniques, the microgravity environment related to several different Orbiter, crew, and experiment operations is presented and interpreted. The microgravity environment represented by SAMS and OARE data is comparable to the environments measured by the instruments on earlier microgravity science missions. The OARE data compared well with predictions of the quasi-steady environment. The SAMS data show the influence of thruster firings and crew motion (transient events) and of crew exercise, Orbiter systems, and experiment operations (oscillatory events). Thruster activity on this mission appears to be somewhat more frequent than on other microgravity missions with the combined firings of the F 5 L and F 5 R jets producing significant acceleration transients.
