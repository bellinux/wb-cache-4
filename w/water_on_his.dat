5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E

500|$|In the Shiva Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana, the rakshasa disguises {{himself as}} a Brahmin cook and gains entry to the king's kitchen. When Vashishtha arrives in Ayodhya on the king's {{invitation}} for a Shraddha ceremony, or simply dinner, the demon cooks human flesh and offers that to the sage {{on behalf of the}} king. The enraged sage curses him to be transformed into a human-eating rakshasa and wander the forests. The pious king is outraged by the unjust curse and quarrels with the sage. Vashishtha reduces the curse to 12 years when he hears of the rakshasa's deception. But the king is not satisfied. He takes water in his hand to cast a curse on Vashishtha, but the queen dissuades him. However, the curse-ridden water cannot be wasted. If thrown on the ground, it will destroy the crop. If thrown in the air, it will spoil the rains. Throwing in any direction would harm some living beings. Ultimately, the king throws the <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own feet. Since the king's feet become black and white in colour, he gains the epithets Kalmashapada and Kalmasanghri (literally, [...] "pied feet").|$|E

His {{picture of a}} Los Angeles County firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in Altadena ran both in the Times and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly {{said he had been}} asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming [...] "I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but {{to the best of my}} recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ...

2500|$|However, {{it would}} not be Andronikos who would fight the Normans but Isaac Angelos, a {{great-grandson}} of Alexios I, was foretold by a soothsayer that he would one day rule the empire. Andronikos could not bear such a prophecy and ordered his immediate arrest by courtier Stephen Hagiochristophorites. This backfired for Andronikos, with Isaac killing Stephen and arousing the citizens within the Hagia Sophia to rise in revolt. Prisons were opened and the prisoners joined the riot. Andronikos seems to have taken this lightly, as yet another tiresome rebellion to destroy – only when the palace guards refused to obey him did he realise {{the full extent of the}} danger. [...] He planned to escape with his teen wife Agnes of France and his concubine Maraptike aboard a galley. He was caught before he could execute his escape – and suffered dearly for it: [...] "They beat him, stoned him, goaded him with spikes, pelted him with filth. A woman of the streets poured boiling <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head...Then dragging him from the camel, they hung him up by his feet. At last, after much agony, he died, carrying his remaining hand to his mouth; which he did in the opinion of some, that he might suck the blood that flowed from one of his wounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Archaeology of Baptism (1876) Wolfrid Cote, quoting Prudentius, {{who in his}} Psychomachia {{spoke of}} the [...] "bathed chests" [...] of the baptized, and the views of two earlier Italian archaeologists, stated that [...] "the {{primitive}} mode {{appears to have been}} this: The administrator and candidate both standing in the water the former placed his right hand on the head of the candidate, and, pronouncing the baptismal words, gently bowed him forward, till he was completely immersed in the water". He included in his book a woodcut of a fresco in the Catacomb of San Callisto (a photographic reproduction appears in this article), and reported that one archaeologist interpreted it as a youth being baptized by affusion, while for another the youth standing in the water was [...] "immersed in a cloud of water". Cote described this painting as of great antiquity, probably of the 4th or 5th century, while remarking {{that it is impossible to}} ascertain the precise age of the pictures in the catacombs of Rome. [...] The other paintings that Cote described are of much later periods, while the mosaic in the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte, in Ravenna (erected in the 4th century), which shows John baptizing Jesus by pouring <b>water</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head from a cup, Cote explained as the product of later restoring. The font in this baptistery Cote described as ten feet in diameter and three and a half feet deep. Cote listed 67 still existing Italian baptisteries dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries, all of which he understood to have been used for total immersion. He made no mention of any pre-Constantine evidence.|$|E
