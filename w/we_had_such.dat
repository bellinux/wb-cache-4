Helen Phillips said of his {{performance}} as Little John, [...] "excellently played by Clive Mantle, the series' John at first appears to conform to a, by then, well- established stereotype." [...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a great, fun crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{struggled}} with Yorke's change of direction. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood {{was concerned that}} the album [...] "might appear too gratuitous a move towards electronica and random digital experimentation." [...] His brother Colin feared [...] "some awful art-rock nonsense just {{for its own sake}} so that it looks like you're cutting your nose off to spite your face." [...] According to Yorke, Godrich [...] "didn't understand why, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else. But {{at the same time he}} trusted me to have an idea of what I wanted." [...] The band had to accept that not every member would play on every song, which caused conflict. O'Brien said: [...] "It's scary— everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
