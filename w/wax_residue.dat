In this study, a microwave demulsification method was utilized in a 50 - 50 % and 20 - 80 % of water-in-oil emulsions with varied microwave exposure time. Results show that, temperature profiles of water-in-oil emulsions inside a cylindrical container were measured. The temperature rise at a given location was linear. The rate of temperature increase of emulsions decreased at higher temperature due to decreasing dielectric loss of water.

40|$|Both, G. mellonella and S. exigua, {{are most}} {{important}} pests in tropical countries. G. mellonella has five to six generations per year (Abid et al. 1997; Ali 1996), there, and feeding in bee combs they find, besides <b>wax,</b> <b>residues</b> of honey, insect skin and pollen (Hachiro & Knox 2000). Li et al. (1987) have shown the efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis aizawai against G. mellonella. It is registered in the EU as Mellonex for its control, but NeemAzal T/S may also be active, and will have some advantages (Leymann et al. 2000, Melathopoulos et al. 2000). Therefore we conducted new studies here, on the results we shall report. S. exigua is an important polyphagous pest of crops in tropical areas (Brown & Dewhurst 1975). By repeated control with synthetic insecticides, especially by illiterate farmers (Armes et al. 1992; Aggarwal et al. 2006 a) resistance {{to a lot of}} those insecticides has been built up, making plant protection very difficult. Therefore the need is pronounced for microbial and botanical pesticides (Nagarkatti 1982; Rao et al. 1990), which have different modes of action than synthetic insecticides. Aggarwal et al. (2006 b) have started to test such ingredients, but the time of observation was too short (3 days), since the effects of Neem products occur later than those of synthetic insecticides (Basedow et al. 2002). So we conducted new, longer lasting experiments (with 5 to 30 days), on which we give a report here. The experiments were conducted during guest stays of the three co-authors (from Mymensingh, Bangladesh, from Nazreth, Ethiopia, and from Khartoum, Sudan) at the Experimental Station of the Institute of Phytopathology and Applied Zoology at Giessen Univerity. Im Labor wurden die Larven mit trockenem Futter versorgt, das vorher für 20 Sek. in die Testlösung getaucht war. Die Testlösungen, auch in der Kontrolle, wurden mit dem anionischen Detergens Triton X 100 versetzt (10 %, davon 0. 1 ml). XenTari wurde mit 0. 5, 1 und 2 mg/l getestet, NeemAzal mit 2, 4 und 8 mg/l. Bei G. mellonella war die höchste korrigierte Mortalität bei XenTari nach 4 Wochen 77 %, bei NeemAzal T/S 100 %. So wird letzteres empfohlen.

40|$|The {{potential}} of postharvest dip treatments with fludioxonil (FLU) (a synthetic analogue of the bacterial metabolite of pyrrolnitrin), in controlling postharvest decay caused by Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum of citrus fruit {{was investigated in}} comparison with the conventional fungicide imazalil (IMZ). The ultrastructural changes of fruit epicuticular wax was investigated as a function of water dip temperature, and the possible role of these changes was related to residue accumulation under FLU treatment. Residues retained by fruit were determined as a function of fungicide concentration, dip temperature, and fruit storage conditions. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that fruit dipping in water at 30 or 40 °C did not cause differences in cuticular wax’s ultrastructure in comparison to control fruit, while treatments at 50, 55, or 60 °C caused the disappearance of wax platelets, resulting in relatively homogeneous skin surface, due to partial “melting” of epicuticular <b>wax.</b> <b>Residues</b> of FLU in fruit treated at 20 or 50 °C were significantly correlated with the doses of fungicide applied. When equal amounts of fungicide were employed, the residue concentrations were notably higher (from 2. 6 - to 4 -fold) in fruit treated at 50 °C than in fruit treated at 20 °C. The dissipation rate of FLU in “Salustiana” and “Tarocco” oranges was lower in fruit subjected to treatment at 50 °C. The minimal FLU concentration for almost complete decay control in artificially wounded fruit during 7 -d storage at 20 °C was 400 mg/L active ingredient (ai) in fruit treated at 20 °C and 100 mg/L ai in fruit treated at 50 °C. Results on nonwounded Tarocco oranges subjected to 3 weeks of simulated quarantine conditions at 1 °C, plus 6 weeks of standard storage at 8 °C and an additional two weeks of simulated marketing period (SMP) at 20 °C revealed that almost complete decay control with FLU applications of 100 mg/L at 50 °C and 400 mg/L at 20 °C resulted in ca. 0. 8 mg/kg FLU fruit residues, in agreement with results on wounded citrus fruit. When equal concentrations and temperatures were applied, FLU treatments were as effective as IMZ. In vitro trials showed a low sensitivity to FLU against P. digitatum and P. italicum isolates. MIC values for the complete inhibition of mycelium growth were ≥ 100 μg/mL, while ED 50 values ranged from 0. 1 to 1 μg/mL for P. digitatum and from 1 to > 100 μg/mL for P. italicum. The latter result suggests that care should be taken to avoid exclusive application of FLU in a sustainable program for management of fruit decay.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} energy {{prices and the}} drive to reduce CO 2 emissions, universities and industries are challenged to find new technologies {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption, to meet legal requirements on emissions, and for cost reduction and increased quality. Formation of emulsions during oil production and processing is a costly problem, both in terms of chemicals used and production losses. In this thesis, an alternative and cost effective microwave heating technology in demulsification of water-in-crude oil (W/O) emulsions was utilized and investigated. Two different types of Malaysian crude oils namely; heavy and light were mixed together at a volume ratio of (50 - 50 %). The experimental studies began with some important physical and chemical characterizations of crude oil such as density, viscosity, shear rate, shear stress, water content, pour point, interfacial properties, and chemical fractionation of saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA), respectively, to provide understanding of fundamental issues such as formation, formulation and breaking of emulsions by chemicals, microwave approaches, and conventional heating. The aim was to obtain the best conditions as well as fundamental understanding of water-in-oil stability, upon which further development on demulsification process could be developed. The stability studies were carried out by analyzing operating conditions such as emulsifier concentration (1. 5 - 2. 5 vol. %), emulsifier type, and water-oil ratio of (20 - 80 %), (30 - 70 %), and (40 - 60 %). For stability performance test, five emulsifiers were used namely; Span 80, Span 83, Triton X- 100, DEA and low Sulphur <b>wax</b> <b>residue</b> (LSWR). Among these, emulsion stabilized by Span 80 was the best for emulsion stability because it produced the emulsions with smallest size of droplets. For emulsion demulsification performance test, three methods were used which are; chemicals, microwave assisted chemicals and conventional method (hot plate). For chemical demulsification test, four demulsifiers with different concentrations (1. 5 - 2. 5 vol%) and functional groups were utilized; which are: Octylamine, Hexylamine, Dioctylamine, and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 600). Among these, Octylamine was found to be the best in separating water and oil from emulsions due to its lower molecular size. For microwave factorial analysis, three factors namely; processing time (1 - 5 minutes), microwave power (180 - 540 watt), and demulsifier concentration (1. 5 - 2. 5 vol. %) using face centered composite design (FCCD) under RSM were employed. The evaluation of microwave demulsification indicated that for microwave heating demulsification the best condition for water separation efficiency was achieved at 3 (minutes), 360 (watt), and 2. 50 vol. %. Whereas, the separation efficiency reached at 100 % within 24 hours in emulsion with 40 % water content. The best condition for conventional heating demulsification using FCCD and processing parameters of time (1 - 5 minutes), temperature (30 - 160 ˚C), and demulsifier concentration (1. 5 - 2. 5 vol. %) was obtained at 5 minutes, 160 ˚C, and 1. 5 vol. %, where it reached to 96 % within 36 hours in emulsion with 40 % water. The results obtained in this thesis have exposed the capability of microwave-assisted chemical technology in demulsification of W/O emulsions, further works, are nevertheless required to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms involved to facilitate the development of an optimum system applicable to the industry...|$|E

For all the considered a. i. the average levels of residues in all kinds of samples (organic and conventional) grouped by year, decreased during the considered time period. Classification according to production method showed that organic beekeeping practices have definitely reduced levels of residues, although these persist in wax for a long time.

The method was successfully applied to examine field residue levels of these contaminants in rape and sunflower crop plants which had been seed-treated with imidacloprid. The analyzed samples included pollen, flowers, leaves, nectar, honey, <b>wax</b> and bees. <b>Residues</b> of imidacloprid and its metabolites 5 -hydroxy-imidacloprid and olefin-imidacloprid are extracted with metha-nol/water. The extracts are subjected to liquid-liquid partition on a column filled with diatomaceous earth and subsequent solid phase extraction on a silica gel column. Quantification is performed by reversed phase HPLC with electrospray MS/MS-detection. External bracketing standards in matrix are used to compensate possible matrix effects in the ion source. The overall recoveries for imidacloprid, 5 -hydroxy-imidacloprid and olefin-imidacloprid from plant matrices were between 91 and 97 % with a relative standard deviation between 6. 0 and 8. 5 %. The detector linearity and the repeatability of the method proved to be very precise. The limits of quantification were 0. 005 and 0. 01 mg/kg for imidacloprid and 5 -hydroxy-imidacloprid, and for the olefin-metabolite, respectively. Field residue studies were conducted on seed-treated rape and sunflower crops. Small bee colonies were caged on flowering sunflower and rape plots and served as collecting devices for nectar and pollen. Flower petals, leaves, honey bees and the col-lected pollen and nectar samples were analysed by the new HPLC-MS/MS method.

Despite the severity of problem of white pitch deposits, there is little information on analysis of these contaminants. Gas chromatography (GC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-NMR), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to separate the complex constituents and identify the functional groups of the white pitch deposits. GC analysis based on retention time allowed to determine paraffin wax, polyethylene <b>wax,</b> wood pitch <b>residues,</b> and certain additives such as rosin. Hot-melt adhesives and cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene were separated by SEC based on molecular weight and verified by FTIR and ¹H-NMR.

Commercially mature fruit were submerged in water at 20 °C (control fruit) or TBZ at 1000 mg/L and 20 °C for 60 s, or in hot water without or with TBZ at 300 mg/L and 53, 56, or 59 °C for 60, 30, and 15 s respectively. Following treatments, fruit were stored for 3 weeks at 1 °C (simulated quarantine conditions for fruit disinfestations against Mediterranean fruit fly, Medfly), followed by 4 days at 3 °C (simulated long distance transport), and finally kept at 20 °C for 3 days (shelf-life, SL). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of ‘Tarocco’ orange surface showed that the typical wax platelets, lifting around edges of wax plates and areas free of epicuticular wax (ECW), that disappeared after hot water dips at 53 – 59 °C for 60 – 15 s, become visible again after storage for 21 days at 1 °C (quarantine conditions), and changes involving the appearance of rough ultrastructure, presence large curled plates, fissured wax crusts, and areas with ECW deficiencies, became much more pronounced after shelf-life.
