5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> visitor to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it {{at the end of the}} Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> species.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{sighting}} of a Sumatran Rhino in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo.

This optimism was met with despair as that very specific Sumatran Rhino was found dead several weeks later after the sighting. The reason of the death is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Nora Chadwick (1950) {{suggested}} that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon’s wife Þóra and her sister, Guðrún; {{and that the}} figure of the shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta may also be an aspect of Þorgerðr. Lotte Motz (1993) proposed that Þorgerðr <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship in her own right in heathen Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Subtropical Storm Alpha (also called Alfa) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{off-season}} subtropical cyclone {{that hit}} Georgia in May 1972. It developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone {{in the western}} Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over $100,000 (1972USD), {{and there were two}} associated deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emilia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that affected the Baja California peninsula in July 2006. The sixth tropical depression and fifth tropical storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, it developed on July 21 about 400miles (650km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. It moved northward toward the coast, reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h) before turning westward and encountering unfavorable conditions. Emilia later turned to the north, passing near Baja California as a strong tropical storm. Subsequently the storm moved further away from the coast, and on July 27 it dissipated.|$|E

5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
5|$|A flint dagger was {{discovered}} on the site. This type of artefact {{is rare in}} Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the Bronze Age the site was used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by Bronze Age funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site. Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the site <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain the nearest source is the Baltic. It would have been traded over long distances. The necklace {{was discovered}} {{as part of a}} 4,000‑year‑old burial.|$|E

5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|Having {{long been}} {{agricultural}} land, in the 18th century {{the town was}} divided up into five farms: Tanyard, Partington, Oakfield, Broadoak, and Elm. Hale Chapel was established in Hale Barns by Nonconformists in 1723 on what is now Chapel Lane. It underwent alterations around 1880. The chapel is the earliest place of worship in either Hale or Hale Barns and is a Grade II* listed building, one of only nine in Trafford. It also houses an eighteenth-century pulpit and nineteenth-century stained glass. In 1740, a school was founded by the Unitarian minister of Hale– a time when education <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> commodity– and {{can be seen on}} a map of 1800 along with a tithe barn, two inns, five farms, four cottages, the school house and school rooms.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Able <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} outside the typical North Atlantic hurricane season. The first tropical cyclone in 1951, Able developed from a trough of low pressure on May 15 about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda. Initially subtropical in nature, Able acquired tropical characteristics {{as it moved}} over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and attained hurricane status on May 17 {{off the coast of}} Florida. This made Able one of only four May Atlantic hurricanes on record. On May 22 Able reached peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) about 70miles (115km) off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane weakened as it turned eastward, and became an extratropical cyclone on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alex <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Allen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> and {{extremely}} powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that struck the Caribbean, eastern and northern Mexico, and southern Texas in August 1980. The first named storm and first tropical cyclone of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, {{it was one}} of the strongest hurricanes in recorded history. It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on three separate occasions, and spent more time as a Category5 than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes. Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190mph (305km/h), thus making it the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed. Until Hurricane Patricia in 2015, these were also the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
