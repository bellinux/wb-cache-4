The two Han commanderies located in Hainan were abandoned in 82 BC and 46 BC, despite the Han government's interest in the area's rare resources.|$|E

5|$|This period {{coincided with}} further {{confiscations}} {{of private property}} belonging to Armenians. Special commissions <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> separate the evictions of non-Muslims from others.

5|$|Aside from dancewear and conventions, {{developments}} in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s {{at the beginning}} of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> exclusively represent street dancers.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{the castle}} {{structures}} were mostly covered with rubble and debris, interwoven with pathways {{created by the}} movement of visitors over the years. During the Second World War, the castle {{was used by the}} British Army, possibly as an early warning site fitted with anti-aircraft searchlights. In an area just {{to the north of the}} castle, the Starfish and Naval decoy sites <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> distract incoming German bombers from the town of Rye itself. Trenches were dug in the north bastion, and military training may have been conducted around the outskirts of the castle.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{provides}} 16 basic armies, Armies of Arcana <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> allow players {{to use any}} miniature they want, so a point system <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> enable players <b>to</b> <b>create</b> their own troops that could still be equally matched against existing soldiers.|$|R

50|$|As SARTA grew, {{satellite}} {{offices were}} added to better serve the county's public transportation needs. SARTA established four transfer stations and customer service offices. The Alliance Transfer Center <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> serve northeastern Stark County. The Massillon Transfer Center <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> serve the southwestern part of the county. The downtown Canton Transfer Center (also known as Cornerstone) <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> serve the heart of Stark County.

5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

In 2003, to celebrate fifty years of Sports Personality of the Year, two special anniversary awards <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> recognise the best team and Sports Personality from the previous fifty years.

The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E

The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E
5|$|To {{administer}} {{the newly created}} National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B.

Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director. Within OAHP new divisions <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> deal with the National Register. The division administered several existing programs, including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, {{as well as the}} new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund.|$|E
5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models <b>were</b> <b>created</b> <b>to</b> account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
