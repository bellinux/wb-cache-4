50|$|Catananche lutea, is a woolly annual plant, {{assigned}} to the daisy family, with most leaves in a basal rosette, and some smaller leaves on the stems {{at the base of}} the branches. Seated horizontal flowerheads develop early on under the rosette leaves. Later, not or sparingly branching erect stems grow to 8-40 cm high, carrying solitary flowerheads at their tips with a papery involucre <b>whitish</b> to <b>beige,</b> reaching beyond the yellow ligulate florets. Flowers are present between April and June. This plant is unique for the five different types of seed it develops, few larger seeds from the basal flowerheads, which remain in the soil, and smaller seeds from the flowerheads above ground that may be spread by the wind or remain in the flowerhead when it breaks from the dead plant. This phenomenon is known as amphicarpy. The seeds germinate immediately, but in one type, germination is postponed. It naturally occurs around the Mediterranean. Sources in English sometimes refer to this species as yellow succory.|$|R
50|$|Adult Western skinks {{have a broad}} brown stripe {{down their}} backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a {{conspicuous}} <b>whitish</b> to <b>beige</b> dorsolateral stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail. A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating {{on the side of}} head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown. Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood. In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail. They usually have seven supralabial scales and four enlarged nuchals. Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.|$|R

50|$|The {{terminal}} {{branches of}} the stem are up to 20 cm long and mostly do not carry bracts. Two types of flowerhead (or capitula) occur: early - probably cleistogamous - subterranean flowerheads at the base under the rosette leaves, which have between one and three florets, and capitula on the stems, which have many florets. The papery <b>whitish</b> or <b>beige</b> bracts, sometimes with a dark midvein or base, surround each flowerhead and form a bell-shaped involucre of 1½-3 cm long, and ¾-1½ cm in diameter. The involucral bracts on the outside are egg-shaped, 4-5 mm long and about 2½ mm wide, while the inner ones are more narrow, 9-20 mm long and 3-6 mm wide, with a pointy or tapering tip. The common base of the florets (called receptacle) is set with bristles. The yellow corolla of the aerial ligulate florets is 1¼-1½ mm long, while the tube carries long, straight, soft hairs (or pilose). The tube that is formed by the five fused anthers is 2-3 mm long, the tip squared-off.|$|R

40|$|The term ‘dimension stone’ {{covers a}} wide variety of {{naturally}} occurring stones used for the external cladding, structure and internal decoration of buildings. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a thriving dimension stone industry that relies on imported stone. In 2008, the UAE imported 217 836 tonnes of dimension stone (blocks and slabs of basalt, granite, marble, sandstone, travertine and porphyry) with a value of over US 42 million. The top countries of origin (by value) are India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, China, Oman, Italy, Iran, Turkey, Greece and Pakistan. The most popular dimension stone is limestone that has a consistently uniform colour (<b>whitish,</b> cream and <b>beige)</b> with little or no textural variation. Dimension stone companies in the UAE are interested in using dimension stone that is produced from indigenous resources. However, currently there is no significant production of dimension stone by the quarrying industry in the UAE. This work, funded by the UAE Ministry of Energy, examines the potential to develop the indigenous dimension stone resources of the UAE. The two major rock types with dimension stone potential are the limestones in the north and the igneous rocks in the central and south parts of the Hajar mountains. The work was sub-divided into five phases: market research, resource identification, field collection of stone samples, technical testwork and preparation of outputs. Traditionally, the local construction materials used in buildings in the UAE include coral, gypsum plaster, lime (from seas shells), mud bricks, stone, wood and thatch (palm leaves). Modern day architecture in the UAE is dominated by prestige building projects which make use of dimension stone from across the world. The most popular includes Crema Marfil (beige-coloured limestone, Spain), Carrara Bianco (white marble, Italy), Rosso Levanto (red serpentinite, Italy), Galaxy Black (black gabbro anorthosite, India) and Emperadore Dark (brecciated dolomite, Spain). The potential dimension stone resources of the UAE are in the Mesozoic platform and deep water limestones (mainly east of Ras Al Khaimah) and the igneous rocks of the Oman-UAE ophiolite. The limestones assessed were selected from a separate project to study the high-purity limestone resources of the UAE. The ophiolite resources assessed contain several bodies of gabbro, a coarse grained igneous rock (five of which were considered), dunite and harzburgite. The potential dimension stone resources were assessed, based on i) the likelihood of extracting blocks larger than 1 metre square, ii) their appearance when polished, iii) their technical properties and iv) the accessibility of the resource location. The outcome of this assessment was a prioritisation (high, medium or low) of the resources as a basis for further investigation into their potential for development as sources of dimension stone. The limestones with the highest priority for further work are the Musandam 2 Formation, Dhera Limestone Formation, Jebel Qamar South Limestone Formation and Jebel Qamar North Limestone Formation. The ophiolite rocks with the highest priority are the Fujairah Gabbro, Kalba Gabbro and harzburgite. The recommendations of this study include promotion of the dimension stone resources to potential investors and research on industrial-scale quarrying and production of blocks for the dimension stone industry in the UAE. It is recommended that {{the findings of this study}} are made freely available to interested stakeholders. Also it is recommended that a set of polished tiles is produced to represent the dimension stone in the UAE that could be used to create interest from potential investors, dimension stone companies and clients at trade exhibitions. Publication of a book on the indigenous dimension stone resources of the UAE is recommended. Encouragement should be given for the use of indigenous dimension stone in government building programmes...|$|R
