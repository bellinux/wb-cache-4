500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the WWT reserve at Slimbridge, no Bewick's swans were regularly wintering on the Severn Estuary. In 1948, one arrived at Slimbridge, perhaps attracted by a captive <b>whistling</b> <b>swan.</b> A mate for this bird was acquired from the Netherlands and the pair eventually successfully bred. More wild Bewick's swans joined the group so that by 1964, more than thirty wild swans were present. So that the birds could be better studied, the tame resident swans were relocated to an easily observable lake. Peter Scott realised that every bird had a unique patterning of black and yellow on its beak by which individual birds could be recognised. These were recorded in small paintings with front and side views (rather like [...] "mug shots") to aid recognition. By 1989, over six thousand swans had been recorded visiting the site, and by this means, much research was made possible on the birds.|$|E

50|$|The {{time from}} laying to {{hatching}} is 29-30 days for Bewick's swan and 30-32 {{days for the}} <b>whistling</b> <b>swan.</b> Since they nest in cold regions, tundra swan cygnets grow faster than those of swans breeding in warmer climates; those of the <b>whistling</b> <b>swan</b> take about 60-75 days to fledge—twice as fast {{as those of the}} mute swan for example—while those of Bewick's swan, about which little breeding data is known, may fledge a record 40-45 days after hatching already. The fledglings stay with their parents for the first winter migration. The family is sometimes even joined by their offspring from previous breeding seasons while on the wintering grounds; Tundra swans do not reach sexual maturity until 3 or 4 years of age.|$|E
50|$|The <b>whistling</b> <b>swan</b> is {{the most}} common swan species of North America, {{estimated}} to number almost 170,000 individuals around 1990. Its numbers seem to be slowly declining in the west of its range since the late 19th century, coincident with the expansion of human settlement and habitat conversion in the birds' wintering areas; the eastern <b>Whistling</b> <b>Swan</b> populations on the other hand seem to be increasing somewhat, and altogether its numbers seem to have slightly risen in the late 20th century (the population was estimated at about 146,000 in 1972). Bewick's Swan remains far less known; the European winter population was estimated at 16,000-17,000 about 1990, with about 20,000 birds wintering in East Asia. The Iranian wintering population is small—1,000 birds or so at most—but they usually disperse to several sites, some of which are still unknown to scientists.|$|E
50|$|Tundra swans have high-pitched honking {{calls and}} sound {{similar to a}} black goose (Branta). They are {{particularly}} vocal when foraging in flocks on their wintering grounds; any conspecific arriving or leaving will elicit a bout of loud excited calling from its fellows. Contrary to its common name, the ground calls of the <b>whistling</b> <b>swan</b> are not a whistle and neither notably {{different from that of}} Bewick's swan. The flight call of the latter is a low and soft ringing bark, bow-wow...; the <b>whistling</b> <b>swan</b> gives a markedly high-pitched trisyllabic bark like wow-wow-wow in flight. By contrast, the whooper and trumpeter swans' names accurately describe their calls—a deep hooting and a higher-pitched French horn-like honk, respectively. Flying birds of these species are shorter-necked and have a quicker wingbeat than their relatives, but they are often impossible to tell apart except by their calls.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} {{analyses of the}} intestinal bacterial flora of Canada geese and <b>whistling</b> <b>swans</b> were carried out with the finding that wild birds harbor significantly more fecal coliforms than fecal streptococci. The reverse was typical of captive and fasting birds. Neither Salmonella spp. nor Shigella spp. were isolated from 44 migratory waterfowl that were wintering in the Chesapeake Bay region. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were detected in seven birds. Geese eliminated 10 (7) and swans 10 (9) fecal coliforms per day. Results of in situ studies showed that large flocks of waterfowl can cause elevated fecal coliform densities in the water column.

40|$|Reports from {{wildlife}} watchers and sportsmen {{will help}} the biologists monitor the recovery of trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator). Positive identification is essential, as trumpeters often mix with flocks of the relatively common tundra (<b>whistling)</b> <b>swans</b> (C. columbianus) throughout their migration and winter range. Distinguishing trumpeters from tundras is not easy, {{but it is possible}} by paying close attention to a few distinctive characteristics. The mute swan (C. owl) is an introduced Eurasian species that occurs in North American avicultural collections and in the wild primarily along the east coast, Great Lakes and in other limited areas of me United Slates and Western British Columbia.

50|$|C. c. columbianus breeds in {{the coastal}} plains of Alaska and Canada, leaving for winter {{quarters}} about October. They arrive in winter quarters by November/December. Birds breeding in western Alaska winter along the Pacific coast from southern Alaska to California; they often move inland - particularly to the rich feeding grounds in the Californian Central Valley - and some cross the Rocky Mountains again and winter as far east as Utah and south to Texas and northern Mexico. The birds breeding along the Arctic Ocean coast migrate via Canada and the Great Lakes region to winter at the Atlantic coast of the USA, mainly from Maryland to South Carolina, but some move {{as far south as}} Florida. <b>Whistling</b> <b>swans</b> start leaving for the breeding grounds again by mid-March, and arrive by late May.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. All filarial nematodes of the family Onchocercidae are parasites of vertebrates and require intermediate insect hosts for completion of their life-cycles. Eighteen genera within this family are known to infect birds but {{very few of the}} associated intermediate hosts have been elucidated. Sarconema eurycerca (Wehr) is a filarial nematode of swans and geese. A recent study of S. eurycerca in American <b>Whistling</b> <b>Swans</b> (Cygnus c. columbianus) has demonstrated that the intermediate insect host is a feather louse, Trinoton anserinum (Fabricius) (Seegar, 1977). The main aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between S. eurycerca and British swans and to determine whether T. anserinum is the intermediate host of the parasite in this country. A total of 1128 swans (of all species) were examined from sites in Britain, Denmark and Iceland. Infected swans were detected by examining blood samples for larval stages of S. eurycerca (microfilariae) using a new sedimentation technique developed in the study.

50|$|Although {{tundra swan}} numbers are stable {{over most of}} its range, they are {{increasingly}} dependent on agricultural crops to supplement their winter diet, as aquatic vegetation in their winter habitat dwindles due to habitat destruction and water pollution.

Bewick's swan cannot be hunted legally, but almost half the birds studied contained lead shot in their body, indicating they were shot at by poachers. Lead poisoning by ingestion of lead shot is a very significant cause of mortality also, particularly in the <b>whistling</b> <b>swan.</b> The tundra swan is not considered threatened by the IUCN due to its large range and population.
