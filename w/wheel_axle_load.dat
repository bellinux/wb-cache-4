40|$|The large {{majority}} of New Zealand's road network is constructed from thin surfaced unbound flexible pavements where a granular layer provides the main structural strength of the pavement. The current New Zealand empirical design theory states that permanent deformation should largely {{be attributed to the}} subgrade and that shape loss in the granular layers is simply a consequence of a previously deformed subgrade. However, recent research and field trials have indicated that basecourse shear strains may be a large contributor to rutting in unbound granular layers. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the shear strains induced under heavy vehicle loads can be accurately measured using in-situ induction coils and whether the shear strains are related to permanent pavement deformation. In this investigation a rosette configuration of free floating induction coils was designed to measure principal basecourse shear strains. The principal strains were then used to construct Mohr's circle of strain in order to calculate the maximum shear strain occurring in the granular layer. The rosettes were installed in two full scale test pavements at the Canterbury Accelerated Pavement Testing Indoor Facility (CAPTIF). The pavements were loaded with an 8 tonne dual <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> for 1 million and 600, 000 load applications respectively and strain and rut depth testing occurred periodically throughout the test life. The research showed that the rosette coil arrangement was a feasible and accurate device for measuring in-situ shear strains in granular pavement layers. Finite element modelling confirmed the accuracy of the system. The results from the two CAPTIF pavements showed that there was a strong linear relationship between the magnitude of the basecourse shear strain and the rut depth {{at the end of the}} post construction compaction period. The investigation also showed that shear strain magnitudes in the region of 5000 µƐ result in rapid shear failure in the granular layer. In addition, after the post construction compaction period had finished, the rate of change of shear strain was proportional to the rate of change of rut development. The results indicated that there was approximately a 4 : 1 ratio between the rate of change in rut depth and the rate of change in shear strain after the initial post construction period. Investigations into the effect of load magnitude on the magnitude of the basecourse shear strain showed that a linear relationship existed between the two parameters. Further to this, load location testing revealed that for a dual wheel configuration, 50 mm of lateral wheel variation either side of a point of interest was the maximum allowable movement that would result in similar strain measurements. The research highlighted the dominance of the longitudinal tensile strain and shear strain over the vertical compressive strain within granular layers. As a result, these pavement responses should be considered in further granular pavement research in addition to the commonly used vertical compressive strains...|$|E

The Raja of Paralakhemedi decided to connect his capital with Naupada, which was only 40 km away. With the then British Government giving sanction in 1898, work began in full earnest. The line was opened to traffic in 1900. This railway line was built {{at a cost of}} Rs 7 lakh. The operations of the PLR was taken over by the Bengal-Nagpur Railway (BNR) in 1902. In the first few years, the PLR had incurred losses but after 1910, it started making marginal profits and after 1924-25, the profits increased. This motivated the Raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931.

40|$|From {{practical}} observation, it {{was noted}} that failure near pavement edges is quite common in New Zealand. This failure mode is associated with the mountainous topography that makes constructing wide pavements expensive. The main objective of this research work is to investigate the different factors affecting this type of distress. A three-dimensional finite elements model was designed to study different loading and shoulder conditions. A half fractional factorial experimental design was developed to study five factors: shoulder width, shoulder stiffness, <b>axle</b> <b>load,</b> tire pressure and pavement thickness. The finite elements model solution was compared with multilayer analysis and actual field measurements carried out at the Transit New Zealand accelerated test track to ensure accurate predictions. None of the solutions provided a perfect match between the measured and predicted vertical strains. The multilayer linear elastic solution and the three-dimensional finite elements solutions were reasonably close. The order of importance of the different factors affecting pavement response in the outer wheel path relies on the type of response. Shoulder thickness was the most important factor affecting the maximum surface deflection under the outer <b>wheel</b> followed by <b>axle</b> <b>load,</b> tire pressure, and shoulder width. For the compressive strain {{on the top of the}} subgrade and the maximum shear strain in the base course, the order of importance of factors was different.
