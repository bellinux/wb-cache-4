5|$|According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his {{distaste for}} Christmas, {{birthday}} parties and other popular customs that {{were described as}} of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Naval Caps {{were made}} of steel gray cloth. They <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less than three inches and a half, nor more than four inches in height. They were also not {{to be more than}} ten, or less than nine inches and a half, at the top, and had a patent leather visor, to be worn by all {{officers}} in their service dress.|$|E
5|$|By early 1916, the British {{blockade}} of Germany {{was beginning to}} have an effect on Germany and her imports. The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U-boats in the first submarine offensive. As a result, the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February. The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany's self-proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning, that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed, and—to avoid antagonizing the United States—that enemy passenger steamers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attacked, regardless of whether in the war zone or not.|$|E

5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered real artists.|$|E
5|$|Holm (1992) {{considers}} Egil's saga {{to equate}} the Kylfings with the Finnic Karelians. In the 14th century, when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in Norrbotten, there were regulations that the Birkarls and the Saami peoples <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interrupted in their traditional activities. A {{large part of the}} Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called Kylfingaland, and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod.|$|E

5|$|In 1594, Albert Frederick's then 14-year-old {{daughter}} Anna {{married the}} son of Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, John Sigismund. The marriage ensured the right of succession in the Prussian duchy {{as well as in}} Cleves. Upon George Frederick's death in 1603, the regency of the Prussian duchy passed to Joachim Frederick. Also in 1603, the Treaty of Gera was concluded by the members of the House of Hohenzollern, ruling that their territories <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> internally divided in the future.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organising Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in parallel to the Games. The Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> added to the official medal tally since Wushu {{was not on the}} programme of the 2008 Olympic Games.|$|E

The resolution affirmed that reprisals <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E

5|$|Tallard's march {{presented}} a dilemma for Eugene.

Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off {{with the rest of his}} army to forestall Tallard.|$|E
5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used {{to put out the}} fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did not engage in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling wares as street peddlers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E
40|$|Histoacryl and Histoacryl Blue topical skin {{adhesives}} {{are intended}} for topical application to hold closed easily approximated skin edges of minimum-tension wounds from clean surgical incisions and simple, thoroughly cleansed, trauma-induced lacerations. Histoacryl and Histoacryl Blue {{may be used in}} conjunction with, but not in place of, dermal sutures. III. CONTRAINDICATIONS • 	 Histoacryl topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> {{below the surface of the}} skin, epidermis. The liquid adhesive will react exothermically with tissue; the polymerized adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> absorbed by any tissues and may elicit a foreign body reaction. • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> any internal organs, blood vessels, nerve tissue, mucosal surfaces or mucocutaneous junctions, areas with dense natural hair, or within the conjunctival sac of the eye. • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> the surface of the eye. If the eyelids are accidentally bonded closed, release eyelashes with warm water by covering with a wet pad.

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. The death penalty was signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Halliday's {{place in}} the Aberdeen Hall of Fame was secured after the war when {{he became the first}} manager to bring {{national}} trophies to Pittodrie. Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup in the 1945–46 season, defeating Rangers 3–2 at Hampden. They then reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final, defeating Hibernian 2–1 with George Hamilton, signed from Halliday's former club Queen of the South, scoring to gain the club's first major trophy. From this early success, Halliday's side reached two more Scottish Cup finals, in 1953 and 1954, though they lost both. Halliday's team <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> denied, however, and the following season, 1954–55, Aberdeen won their first Scottish League title. Though league winners, the club did not participate in the first European Cup competition—Scotland's place was awarded to Hibernian, who took part by special invitation.|$|E
