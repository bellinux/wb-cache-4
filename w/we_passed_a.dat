2500|$|After von Neumann’s {{death in}} 1957, the faculty {{organized}} {{a committee to}} terminate the project. All the permanent faculty met in Oppenheimer’s living room. As Cherniss explained, ‘This was back when {{we used to do}} things right. Everything was informal.’ After the final decision was made, Cherniss elaborated ‘But <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> more general motion. It was a declaration to have no experimental science, no laboratories of any kind at the Institute.' In his history, Regis remarked ‘And so it has been ever since. The Platonic-heavenly fathers [...] had triumphed.’ Another faculty member, the physicist Freeman Dyson, said simply ‘The snobs took revenge.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|South Africa {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{incidence}} of HIV/AIDS in the world, with a 2005 estimate of 5.5 million people living with HIV — 12.4% of the population. The trade union movement has taken a role in combating this pandemic. COSATU is a key partner in the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a registered charity and political force working to educate and promote understanding about HIV/AIDS, and to prevent new infections, as well as push for greater access to antiretrovirals. COSATU passed a resolution in 1998 to campaign for treatment. [...] "It was clear to the labour movement at that time that its lowest paid members were dying because they couldn’t afford medicines," [...] says Theodora Steel, Campaigns Coordinator at COSATU. [...] "We saw TAC as a natural ally in a campaign for treatment. <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> formal resolution at our congress to assist and build TAC." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If I {{drop out}} here I may be frozen to death before I can free myself," [...] he thought. [...] "I will wait until <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> house of some sort." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{still it}} lay {{that every day}} Crawled like a weed-clogged wave: And we forgot the bitter lot That waits for fool and knave, Till once, as we tramped in from work, <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> open grave.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> {{variable}} {{that is of}} type Color, {{how can we get}} the data out of this variable? For example, for a function to get the integer part of , we can use a simple tree pattern and write: ...|$|R
60|$|We {{stumbled}} {{along for}} a time in a close silence. <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> dim-lit, rain-veiled window.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> gas-lamp, I saw Lady Fanny {{laughing}} as usual, and turning her great arch sparkling black eyes at Lord Tiptoff.|$|E
6000|$|Then I playfully tried verbal {{instruction}} in domestic matters, {{as we walked}} about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> butcher's shop, I would say: ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few miles}} below this <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> Indian settlement, the {{cultivated}} fields and white houses of which, {{with the church}} spire in the midst, quite refreshed our eyes, after being so long accustomed to the shades of the primeval forest.|$|R
6000|$|So {{still it}} lay {{that every day}} [...] Crawled like a weed-clogged wave: [...] And we forgot the bitter lot [...] That waits for fool and knave, [...] Till once, as we tramped in from work, [...] <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> open grave.|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> through <b>a</b> gateway into a court, {{and there}} we halted.|$|R
60|$|Returning to the water-side, <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> field, where dwarfs were laboring in beds of yams, heaping {{the soil}} around the roots, by {{scratching}} it backward; as a dog.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{roadside}} grocery {{with a sign}} up, [...] "Potatoes Wanted." [...] An ignorant stranger, doubtless. He {{could not}} have gone thirty steps from his place without finding plenty of them.|$|E
60|$|We {{walked home}} that way, sixteen blocks, with a retinue a mile long: Every time <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> lamp-post, death gripped {{one at the}} throat. But we, got home--and I had on white socks.|$|E
5000|$|For if <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> {{iteration}} band in {{the direction}} of the field lines (and away from the cycle), the iteration number k is increased by 1 and the number ψ is increased by β, therefore the number [...] is constant along the field line.|$|R

6000|$|Then father stood up, {{and so did}} I. So did the two men--the {{clerk and}} the {{shorthand}} writer. Father did not say a word till we got out into the street. We walked along, and presently <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>an</b> open gate into the fields. He turned back, saying to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|We left at once. In {{the passage}} <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> little crowd of hurrying journalists {{on their way}} to answer Staunton's summons. In every room the alarm bell had sounded, and the {{making-up}} of the paper was stopped! ...|$|E
60|$|Every {{half mile}} or so <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> ranch house, and as we {{traveled}} on these ranches grew further apart, until, twelve or fifteen miles out of Sanderson, they were so widely separated that each appeared alone on the wild range.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Ned said, [...] "we {{will go back}} to that bare {{space of}} rock <b>we</b> <b>passed,</b> <b>a</b> hundred yards back. There were dozens of little lizards running about there, it will be hard if we cannot knock some over." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a couple}} of hours <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> round <b>a</b> huge boulder to come to a steep declivity leading down into a valley.|$|R
60|$|About noon, however, <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> through <b>a</b> {{strip of}} woodland, and, on coming {{out at the}} other side, {{observed}} a party of horsemen on the distant horizon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What say {{you to a}} stoup of cider?' I asked, for <b>we</b> were <b>passing</b> <b>an</b> ivy-clad inn, with 'The Beaufort Arms' printed {{upon the}} sign.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> sickly-looking {{girl with}} a sallow face, who dragged her limbs and peered at us dimly with painful eyes. She stood back, as partly blinded people will do, {{to allow us to}} pass, {{although}} there was plenty of room for us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just smell Mrs. Sampson's flowers," [...] said Cecily, as <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> trim white paling {{close to}} the road, over which blew odours sweeter than the perfume of Araby's shore. [...] "Her roses are all out and that bed of Sweet William is a sight by daylight." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not believe}} <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> single town or village that did not possess one or more {{specimens}} of this man's relatives. Our journey seemed, not so much like a tour through Belgium and part of Northern Germany, as {{a visit to the}} neighbourhood where this man's family resided.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>passed</b> along <b>a</b> {{few steps}} {{and saw the}} altar built over the very spot where the good Catholic priests say the {{soldiers}} divided the raiment of the Saviour.|$|R
60|$|Two {{years have}} gone by {{all but a few}} months, and from the rectory in a quiet English village <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> to <b>a</b> scene in Central, or South Central, Africa.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>passed</b> through <b>a</b> {{hall that}} was prettily paved in mosaics, into a chamber of good proportions, which seemed gay {{to me after}} the gloom by which I had been surrounded.|$|R
60|$|Sailing {{south from}} Vivenza, {{not far from}} its coast, <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> cluster of islets, green as new fledged grass; and like the mouths of {{floating}} cornucopias, their margins brimmed over upon the brine with flowers. On some, grew stately roses; on others stood twin-pillars; across others, tri-hued rainbows rested.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> distant steeple {{and large}} castle, {{which we were}} told belonged to Ryswyk, the castle of the Prince of Orange; then we went along through long rows of trees, and {{suddenly}} emerging from them we beheld a vast plain, a great wood, and a city crowned with towers and windmills.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our ship touched at an island, {{where my}} black servant took [...] me a walk over rocks and hills till <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> garden, [...] where {{we saw a}} man walking. 'That is Bonaparte,' said the [...] black; 'he eats three sheep every day, and all the {{children}} [...] he can lay hands on.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The grass {{along the}} wayside was green, {{with a few}} daisies. There was green holly in the hedges, and <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> through <b>a</b> wood, {{up some of the}} tree-trunks of which ran {{clustering}} ivy.|$|R
60|$|Our way lies {{through a}} {{beautiful}} country, richly cultivated, and luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> field where the strong bristling stalks of Indian corn {{look like a}} crop of walking-sticks, and sometimes an enclosure where the green wheat is springing up among a labyrinth of stumps; the primitive worm-fence is universal, and an ugly thing it is; but the farms are neatly kept, and, save for these differences, one might be travelling just now in Kent.|$|R
