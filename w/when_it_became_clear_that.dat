5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became interested in this one <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11.

The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with arsenic poisoning – and traces of arsenic were found in the remains of all three.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Ulysses S. Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child.

5|$|The N1s {{compared}} favourably {{with the}} Nclass, although the type showed little improvement in performance. More {{of the class}} were built <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the type's smaller cylinders provided greater route availability. A total of six engines were built. The N1class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network, and used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave valuable service until they were withdrawn in 1962. None were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E

Zhong Yuan informed the emperor of their mother's plans, however, and the emperor promptly exiled Nuou Jin.|$|E
5|$|By {{a narrow}} margin, Scotland {{qualified}} for the UEFA European Championship {{for the first time}} in 1992. A 1–0 defeat by Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between Bulgaria and Romania in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through. Despite playing well in matches against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage. Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Scotland could not qualify, Andy Roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager.|$|E

5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test.

The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|When on leave, Roger often {{stayed with}} his Uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became {{attracted}} to his cousin Katherine Doughty, four years his junior. Sir Edward and his wife, {{though they were}} fond of their nephew, did not consider marriage between first cousins desirable. At one point the young couple were forbidden to meet, though they continued to do so clandestinely. Feeling harassed and frustrated, Roger hoped {{to escape from the}} situation through a spell of overseas military duty; <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the regiment would remain in the British Isles, he resigned his commission. On 1 March 1853 he left for a private tour of South America on board La Pauline, bound for Valparaíso in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he {{would be free to}} marry Anne. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England began.

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a series}} of pinball machine-like environments in which the player {{controls}} Sonic the Hedgehog, who acts as a pinball {{for the majority of the}} game. Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball was commissioned by Sega <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a new Sonic the Hedgehog game could not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season, as the majority of staff were occupied with developing Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The game was hastily developed, with most work taking place over 61 days. It received mixed reviews upon release, with most critics praising the game's novelty and graphics, although its control scheme was considered a negative factor. A second pinball game, Sonic Pinball Party, was released in 2003, and a spinning rollercoaster of the same name opened in Alton Towers theme park in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially {{within sight of the}} other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, and as a result it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{team that}} should {{determine}} the necessary engineering work {{and assess the}} car's financial viability {{was put in place}} during mid-1989, working from the TWR workshops. Mike Moreton headed the team, joining TWR to run the XJ220 project. Moreton came from Ford Motorsports where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth, and was a project manager for the Ford RS200 Group B rally car program. Richard Owen was appointed chief designer, and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff, including Pete Dodd, {{the only member of the}} group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept. The exterior and interior designers who had worked on the XJ220 prototype, Keith Helfet and Nick Hull, rejoined the project <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> more design work would be needed.|$|E
