5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> send me {{as far away as}} possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E

5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{go along with the}} sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book {{on the subject of the}} law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, {{there had been a}} series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{placed a}} secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts {{in hopes that}} fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt {{that if they did}} not, then it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> leave certain events in the first game unexplained. After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, {{development}} for Kingdom Hearts II began. There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more; Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.|$|E
50|$|The current {{club was}} {{formed as a}} result of the locals believing that the area <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> suited <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run as one club, the new club {{attracting}} players from Hui Mai, Awahuri and Newbury as well as Rongotea.|$|R

5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, {{to the surprise of}} Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the rough}} {{conditions}} at Oozehead, the committee felt an established sports ground <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> play on. Therefore, during the 1877 season they acquired {{the use of}} Pleasington's cricket ground to the south west of the town. Play stopped on this ground after Henry Smith of Preston North End {{died of a heart}} attack whilst playing.|$|E
60|$|Now Featherhead {{took it upon}} him, {{for some}} reason or other, to look down upon Tip Chipmunk, and on every {{occasion}} to disparage him in the social circle, as a very common kind of squirrel, with whom it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> not <b>to</b> associate too freely.|$|R
60|$|When {{they landed}} upon the logs, Marco, whose curiosity {{seemed to be}} {{stronger}} than his appetite, wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards, but Forester thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> first <b>to</b> go and get their breakfast.|$|R
60|$|Farfrae {{checked his}} horse's pace; she guessed why. He was {{thinking}} that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> not <b>to</b> intrude on the other two just now. Henchard had saved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.|$|R
25|$|In early November 1947, {{some weeks}} before the UN {{partition}} resolution, the Jewish Agency Executive decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> deny Israeli citizenship to as many Arabs as possible. As Ben-Gurion explained, {{in the event of}} hostilities, if the Arabs also held citizenship of the Arab state {{it would be possible to}} expel them as resident aliens, which was better than imprisoning them.|$|E
25|$|A {{story of}} the {{founding}} of the city goes as follows: Seleucus asked the Babylonian priests which day <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> found the city. The priest calculated the day, but, wanting the founding to fail, told Seleucus a different date. The plot failed however, because when the correct day came, Seleucus' soldiers spontaneously started to build the city. When questioned, the priests admitted their deed.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} oils of D. ambrosioides contain terpene compounds, {{some of which}} have natural pesticide capabilities. The compound ascaridole in epazote inhibits the growth of nearby plants, so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> relegate this plant at a distance from other inhabitants of the herb garden. Even though this plant has an established place in recipes and in folklore, it is wise to use only the leaves, and those very sparingly, in cooking.|$|E

25|$|The first IRT subway in New York {{would prove}} to be the first attempt at an {{underground}} heavy rail subway. For example, the underground portion of Boston's Green Line, which opened in 1897, had been light rail. Therefore the IRT and its chief engineer George Gibbs felt compelled to develop a subway car that would be stronger and safer than any previously designed railway cars. This inevitably led them to the conclusion that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> design an all steel car to run in the new tunnels.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, however, it {{was clear}} that Hartnell's health was {{affecting}} his performances, and {{that he would not be}} able to carry on playing the Doctor for a long period of time. By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> leave, although later in life he would claim that he had not wanted to go.|$|E
25|$|Yehuda Peled, who had {{commanded}} the failed counterattack on October 8, {{decided that it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> attack from the Syrian enclave to the east, instead of from the Golan again. The 4,000 foot climb from that direction was very steep, but would bring the attacking force straight to the Israeli outpost without fighting on the ridge. The Golani commander, Amir Drori, concurred. Peled's 51st battalion was therefore posted in an abandoned Syrian village {{at the foot of}} the eastern side of the Hermon. For three nights, the battalion practiced a quick climb with full gear, and Peled concluded that the mission was possible. Elazar ordered him to take the entire crest, including the Syrian Hermon. Golani was to capture the Israeli Hermon, while a reserve paratroopers brigade, under the command of Colonel Haim Nadel, would attack the Syrian positions established before the war.|$|E
