40|$|The Schneider orcinol technic for pentose {{estimation}} {{was modified}} by replacing ferric chloride with cupric acetate in {{glacial acetic acid}} as catalyst, to make the test more sensitive and less DNA-reactive. In addition, data were obtained showing that human plasmacontains no detectable nucleic acid by the spectrophotometric determinations applied. A MONG the various colorimetric methods for RNA estimation, the orcinol reaction of Mejbaum as modified by Schneider (1) remains the most sensitive and commonly employed technic for purine-bound ribose quantitation. Later attempts that were made to estimate pyrimidine nucleotides and nucleosides (2, 3) have also been based on the color reaction of ribose with orcinol and ferric chloride, which still has the disadvantage of being nonspecific for ribose estimation.

40|$|The two {{inorganic}} Sb species Sb(III) and Sb(V) {{as well as}} trimethlyantimony dichloride (TMSbCl 2) {{were separated}} by anion exchange chromatography. HPLC eluents were directly aspirated into the plasma of an ICP-MS using ultrasonic nebulization (USN) with membrane desolvation. Leaching of Sb from glass bottles, especially pronounced under alkaline conditions, distinctly increased background Sb- 121 signals. The use of conventional HPLC syringes made of glass resulted in non reproducible blank signals for Sb(V). To overcome these problems, polyethylene bottles for the storage of mobile phases and plastic syringes for the injection of Sb compounds onto the analytical columns were employed. The analysis of Sb(III) standard solutions in the sub mu gl(- 1) range prepared by dilution of stock standard solutions with high-purity water revealed that Sb(III) is easily oxidized to Sb(V) within a few hours. Deoxygenating the water for dilution of standards by flashing <b>working</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> with helium or using 1. 25 mM EDTA - which served as mobile phase for the chromatographic separation - for the dilution of standards, no oxidation of Sb(III) was observed, at least for 8 h.

Decreasing the USN heating temperature from the conventional settings of 140 - 80 degreesC enhanced signal intensities by similar to 25 % and caused no condensation of the aspirated mobile phase. After optimization detection limits for all three Sb species in the low ng l(- 1) range could be established, namely 14 ngl(- 1) for Sb(III), 12 ngl(- 1) for Sb(V) and 9 ngl(- 1) for TMSbCl 2.

The method produced reliable reproducibility, simulated soils (n= 4) RSD 1. 0 %, and was further verified by the analysis e-waste contaminated soils, RSD range 5. 9 – 11. 4 %. The contamination level of BDE- 209 in burning site was consistent with the previous study of Longtang town but lower than Guiyu town, and higher concentration of BDE- 209 in paddy field mainly resulted from the long-standing disassembling area nearby. This accurate and fast method was successfully developed to extract and analyze BDE- 209 in soil samples, showing its potential use for replacing GC to determinate BDE- 209 in soil samples...|$|R
30|$|A 10.0 -mL sample {{solution}} containing 3.0 – 120  μg L− 1 of Cu(II) ions at pH[*]=[*] 2.0 was transferred {{into a glass}} test tube with a conical bottom, and 20.0  μL of a salophen solution in acetonitrile (0.010  M), used as the chelating agent, was added. Then 1.80  mL of a mixture of acetone (as the disperser solvent; 1.68  mL) and chloroform (as the extraction solvent; 120  μL) was rapidly injected into the {{sample solution}} using a syringe, and a stable cloudy solution (water, acetone, and chloroform) was obtained. The resulting Cu–salophen complex was extracted into the fine droplets of chloroform. The mixture was subsequently centrifuged for 5  min at 5000  rpm, and therefore, the extraction solvent (chloroform) containing the analyte was sedimented {{at the bottom of}} the conical test tube. The sediment phase (70 [*]±[*] 3  μL) was then removed using a sampler, transferred into a vial, and diluted with 130  μL of ethanol. This solution was subsequently directly introduced into the flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and the absorbance of the sample solution was measured against the blank solution. The difference between the absorbance of the sample and blank solutions (∆A[*]=[*]As − Ab) at 324.8  nm was used as an analytical signal. A calibration curve was constructed by plotting the analytical signal versus the Cu(II) concentration in a series of <b>working</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solutions.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{develop and}} {{validate}} a simple, accurate and precise colorimetric method using Bougainvillea spectabilis (B. spectabilis) bract color previously not exploited for estimation of amide group containing drugs i. e. lidocaine and ranolazine in pharmaceutical formulations. MethodsMethanolic extract of B. spectabilis was prepared and evaluated for stability of its color at different pH and temperature {{for a period}} of 3 weeks. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method was ascertained by evaluating various validation parameters like linearity, precision, limit of detection, limit of quantitation and specificity according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. About 0. 5 % of B. spectabilis bract color was added to the <b>working</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solutions</b> of the drugs separately and after formation of color complex, and absorbances were noted at 418 nm. ResultsFor color complexes of lidocaine and ranolazine, linearity was found to be in the range of 4 to 24 and 5 to 25 μg/mL respectively. The % relative standard deviation was found to be within specification limits. Presence of lone pair of electron on nitrogen of amide group of both drugs shows basic nature, contributed in formation of color complex between amide and the color pigment obtained from B. spectabilis bracts. ConclusionsIt can be concluded that the method is simple, accurate, economic, and rapid hence can be employed for routine analysis...|$|R

Body weight and fural length {{of each individual}} were registered throughout the study and blood samples (caudal vessels) were obtained from animals of 41 to 84 weeks of age. The serum was separated by centrifugation (3000 r. p. m. � 15 min) and stored at � 20 �C until assayed for rT 3. Fish were killed by concussion to the head and a skin sample from the region adjacent to the pectoral fin was taken. Tissue handling Apart from trout skin, the skin from adult virgin Wistar female rats (250 – 300 g) was obtained. All tissue samples were homogenised (Politron) in 1 : 10 (w/v) ice-cold Hepes buffer (Hepes 10 mmol/l, sucrose 0 · 32 mmol/l, EDTA 1 · 0 mmol/l) pH 7 · 0. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000 r. p. m. � 15 min. The supernatant was separated into aliquots and stored at � 70 �C until assayed.
