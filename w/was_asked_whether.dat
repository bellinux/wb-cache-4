5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin {{regularly}} toured villages in the Goražde, Kalinovik and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić in Split, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.|$|E

Obiang answered he refused to step aside because the new constitution was not retroactive and the two term limit would only become applicable from 2016.|$|E

25|$|Cabinet Ministers held {{a conference}} at 10 Downing Street on 5pm {{on the day}} of the assassination. They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British pressure to do something about it, was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} against anti-trafficking raids {{are related}} to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> {{he might}} have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} {{consumer preference}} {{among the three}} different types of eco-label (Energy Efficiency Grade Label, Korea Eco-Label without a green credit card, and Korea Eco-Label with a green credit card) we designed a questionnaire with 12 questions grouped under four categories in accordance with our SEM model. For the category SV, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> the eco-label provides adequate information regarding climate change mitigation, reduction in energy consumption, and reduction in environmental pollutants (e.g., chemicals harmful to the ozone layer). For the category PV, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> the eco-label provides adequate information regarding economic benefit, usefulness (e.g., safety), {{and ease of use}} (Grolleau et al. 2009). For the category LA, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> the eco-label provides adequate information regarding the usefulness and reliability of eco-label information, and whether the information on the eco-label is of interest to them. For the category PI, respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> they would <b>be</b> willing to purchase, re-purchase or recommend eco-labeled products.|$|R

Chizmar <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>whether</b> or not Richard Farris's initials signified that he was another manifestation of Randall Flagg; his response was “Maayyybee... He's definitely mysterious, and it's really obvious there's more to him than meets the eye."

Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that [...] "Until that point, sport had really been my God". During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions.
