He had divine powers of creating or disappearing any mundane object with his mental power; ability to play musical instruments, sing and act. His chariot could travel over land, water and air with complete ease. Mountains made way for Prithu on his chariot and his flagstaff was never entangled when Prithu travelled through dense forests as the trees made <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Prithu practised charity and donated colossal amounts of gold to the Brahmanas.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Coke {{returned}} to Britain, plans were already under <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to enter Parliament. When an election {{was called in}} 1774, Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this, and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke {{fell in love with}} her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E

50|$|If an {{individual}} {{was not of}} senatorial rank, there were two <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to become a senator.

5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E

The Rams sought an injunction in Federal court to prevent Adams from defecting to the Browns, arguing {{that he was still}} under contract with the Rams despite the move. Adams argued that his contract described a team in Cleveland, and was no longer valid because of the Rams' relocation. A judge ruled in favor of Adams in August 1946, clearing the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and other former Rams players to join the Browns.|$|E
25|$|Merovingian {{society had}} a militarised nature. The Franks called annual {{meetings}} every Marchfeld (1 March), when {{the king and}} his nobles assembled in large open fields and determined their targets for the next campaigning season. The meetings were a show of strength {{on behalf of the}} monarch and a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to retain loyalty among his troops. In their civil wars, the Merovingian kings concentrated on the holding of fortified places and the use of siege engines. In wars waged against external foes, the objective was typically the acquisition of booty or the enforcement of tribute. Only in the lands beyond the Rhine did the Merovingians seek to extend political control over their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|As with {{unimolecular}} reactions, {{the keys}} to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the many processes in emulsion polymerisation are the rate coefficients of the individual steps. These steps are initiation (how quickly a growing chain starts), propagation (how quickly individual monomer units are added), radical loss processes (the termination and transfer of radical activity), and particle formation (nucleation). With Prof D Napper, Gilbert applied equations that he had solved in gas-phase chemistry to the area of emulsion polymerisation. This opened the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to develop—initially in collaboration with Napper—new theoretical and experimental methods for extracting the rate coefficients of elementary processes. He produced targeted data using these methods, particularly the time evolution of reaction rates and molecular-weight and particle-size distributions. This included novel types of systems, such as γ-radiolysis relaxation, in which events such as radical loss can be separated from radical propagation and growth.|$|E
25|$|Gustav found greater success abroad. From 4 February to 25 March 1771, Gustav was in Paris, {{where he}} carried both {{the court and}} the city by storm. The poets and the {{philosophers}} paid him enthusiastic homage, and distinguished women testified to his superlative merits. With many of them he maintained a lifelong correspondence. His visit to the French capital was, however, no mere pleasure trip; {{it was also a}} political mission. Confidential agents from the Swedish court had already prepared the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and the Duke of Choiseul, the retired Chief Minister, resolved to discuss with him the best method of bringing about a revolution in France's ally, Sweden. Before he departed, the French government undertook to pay the outstanding subsidies to Sweden unconditionally, at the rate of one and a half million livres annually. Count de Vergennes, {{one of the most prominent}} French diplomats, was transferred from Constantinople to Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|As a {{university}} professor {{for much of his}} life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor. His approach to teaching was unconventional. His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin {{had little to do with}} computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs. At the beginning of each semester he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.|$|E

25|$|The equites and two senators, Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Scribonius Curio {{supported}} Cicero. They assembled on the Capitol {{and sent}} envoys to the consuls {{and the senate}} on his behalf. Lucius Ninnius tried to rally popular support. However, Clodius prevented him from taking any action. Aulus Gabinius barred the equites from accessing the senate, drove one of them who was persistent {{out of the city}} and rebuked Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio. Calpurnius Piso advised Cicero that leaving Rome was the only <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be safe. Cicero took offence. Caesar condemned the illegality of the action taken in 63 BC, but did not approve the punishment proposed by the law because it was not fitting for any law to deal with past events. Crassus had shown some support through his son, but he sided with the people. Pompey promised help, but he kept making excuses and kept making journeys out of Rome. Cicero got scared, considered resorting to arms and slighted Pompey openly. However, he was stopped by Cato and Hortensius, for fear of a civil war. Cicero left for Sicily, where he had been a governor, hoping to find sympathy there. On that day the law was passed without opposition. It was supported even by people who had actively helped Cicero. His property was confiscated and his house was demolished. Then Clodius carried a law that specified the terms of Cicero’s banishment. This banned him from a radius of 500 miles from Rome and both he and those who harboured him could be killed with impunity. Therefore, he went to Greece.|$|E
