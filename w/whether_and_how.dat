Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental.

5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, <b>whether</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} econometric {{technique}} for modeling endogenous selectivity in householdsâ€™ quantity outcomes as observed in scanner panel data. Simultaneous models of incidence, brand choice and quantity, that treat quantity outcomes as count data, ignore such self-selectivity considerations in quantity outcomes.

Therefore, we adopt a recently proposed econometric technique to deal with selectivity in count data, and then appropriately extend it to handle correlations of quantity outcomes not only with incidence outcomes but also with brand choice outcomes.

They focused on the hiring of skilled workers, such as carpenters, lithographers, and railroad engineers in an attempt to maintain as much control as possible over the work their members did by enforcement of work rules, zealous defense of their jurisdiction to certain types of work, control over apprenticeship programs, and exclusion of less-skilled workers from membership.|$|E

25|$|Because {{multimodality}} {{is continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation {{is no longer just}} text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to multimodality is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. <b>Whether</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine <b>whether</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> reactor walls can be designed to last long enough to make a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E

40|$|Social {{media are}} {{becoming}} more and more popular. Many adolescents and adults present themselves online through a social network site or dating profile. Such widespread engagement in self-presentation on social media may have implications for how we see ourselves and our bodies. These self-views, in turn, can have important consequences for our mental health and well-being. This dissertation investigates negative as well as positive effects of social media use and online self-presentation on self-views of adolescents and adults. Regarding negative effects, this dissertation investigates <b>whether,</b> when, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> social media use leads to an increased focus on one’s own physical appearance, increased dissatisfaction with one’s own appearance, and increased desire to alter the own physical appearance using cosmetic surgery. Regarding positive effects, this dissertation investigates <b>whether,</b> when, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> online self-presentation can increase self-esteem. The findings can inform policy making regarding the discouragement of negative effects and the encouragement of positive effects of social media on self-views...|$|R
