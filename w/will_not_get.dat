A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{medical system}} {{is based on}} a {{fee-for-service}} model, in which doctors are paid on the basis of ordering individual tests and procedures, so that most doctors <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> paid when they do not recommend (or recommend against) a given treatment. This system creates incentives for doctors to recommend additional treatments, rather than exercising evidence-based restraint.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400cm3, else it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|The CPTSD-RI, {{along with}} all other {{assessments}} attempting to measure the severity of child PTSD, had several limitations. First, the CPTSD-RI did not assess {{for all of the}} PTSD symptoms and thus could not provide an accurate assessment of PTSD severity. Additionally, the CPTSD-RI did not assess for functional impairment related to experience with trauma, a limit of many other self-report assessments. These limitations can be combatted by structured interviews given by trained therapists in schools or in a clinical setting. This, however, is problematic because personal interviews are expensive for the families or schools that take part in them, especially when large groups of children are studied, and time consuming. Thus, the CPSS was created to combat these limitations without the need for a supplemental interview. Validated screening tests like the CPSS tests the efficacy of treatment techniques. Without CPSS, the treatments would have no valid test, and children who have experienced trauma <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> the help they require.|$|E

25|$|Washout toilets have a flat {{platform}} with a shallow pool of water. They are flushed by a {{jet of water}} from the back that drives excreta into the trap below. From there, the water flow removes it into the sewage system. An advantage of the design is that users <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> splashed from below. Washout toilets have a shallow pool of water into which waste is deposited, with a trapped drain just behind this pool. Waste is cleared out from this pool of water by being swept over into the trap (usually either a P-trap or an S-trap) and then beyond into a sewer by water from the flush. Washout pans were amongst the first types of ceramic toilets invented and since the early 1970s are now only found in a decreasing number of localities in continental Europe. A washout toilet is a kind of flush toilet which were once predominantly used in Germany, Austria and France. It was patented in Britain by George Jennings in 1852 and remained the standard toilet type in Britain throughout the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|New journals, {{which are}} indexed {{from their first}} {{published}} issue, will receive an impact factor {{after two years of}} indexing; in this case, the citations to the year prior to Volume1, and the number of articles published in the year prior to Volume1, are known zero values. Journals that are indexed starting with a volume other than the first volume <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> an impact factor until they have been indexed for three years. Occasionally, Journal Citation Reports assigns an impact factor to new journals with less than two years of indexing, based on partial citation data. The calculation always uses two complete and known years of item counts, but for new titles one of the known counts is zero. Annuals and other irregular publications sometimes publish no items in a particular year, affecting the count. The impact factor relates to a specific time period; it is possible to calculate it for any desired period, and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) also includes a five-year impact factor. The JCR shows rankings of journals by impact factor, if desired by discipline, such as organic chemistry or psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Understanding and {{accepting}} the psychological state {{an individual is}} in is paramount. There are many mis-conceptions {{of what it means}} for a traumatized individual to be in crisis or 'psychosis'. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and cannot comfort themselves, if treated humanely and respectfully they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> to a state in which they are a danger. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance they will be taken seriously and not just as a sick, delusional individual. It is vital for the assessor to understand that {{what is going on in}} the traumatized persons head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>get</b> in trouble.|$|E
