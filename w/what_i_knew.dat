[...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> about Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E

2500|$|Clancey has {{explained}} this work more simply as follows: “I worked with social scientists (anthropologists, sociologists, and educational psychologists)....We observed people in businesses (such as a customer call center) {{to understand how}} learning naturally occurs. We emphasized how people succeed in doing their work despite having inadequate tools or incomplete procedures, by studying how they helped and learned from each other.” He has also said that his “broad college background in computer science, philosophy, and anthropology...helped me understand the social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning, so I could relate <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> about computer science to what they knew about people.” ...|$|E

Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|After {{four years}} of working on the project, Davis {{published}} Learning to Fly: An Uncommon Memoir of Human Flight, Unexpected Love, and One Amazing Dog in March 2013. Written after her difficult break up with Potter, it is about how she recovered {{from the loss of}} her partner and financial stability and used her developing love of skydiving to overcome her fear of falling. Described as [...] "gripping", it is a [...] "story of personal growth". She had faced a lot of fear free soloing, BASE jumping and sky diving and felt that she could offer people advice about facing fear in general. As she said in an interview, [...] "A big part of the reason I wanted to write the book is that most people have had experiences like this , or will, whether it's a relationship or a career or whatever," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "Even a happy person can become depressed. When you're in that place, if you have some kind of guidance, some ray of hope … <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to hold on to was climbing and this whole new world of skydiving and having new experiences.

2500|$|In a September 2015 {{interview}} with Michael Isikoff, Fiorina said that, {{in the weeks}} following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she {{received a phone call}} from Michael Hayden, then the director of the National Security Agency, asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance. Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina [...] "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security" [...] to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: [...] "I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did," [...] adding, [...] "They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> at the time was our nation had been attacked." [...] Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency [...] "on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness." [...] According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be [...] "as transparent as possible, about as much as possible".|$|E
