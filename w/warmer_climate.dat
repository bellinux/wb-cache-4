5|$|The Umpqua Valley AVA {{contains}} the drainage basin of the Umpqua River, excluding mountainous regions. The Umpqua Valley has a <b>warmer</b> <b>climate</b> than the Willamette Valley, but is cooler than the Rogue Valley to the south. It {{is the oldest}} post-prohibition wine region in Oregon. Grapes grown here include Tempranillo, Baco noir, Pinot noir, Pinot gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, Grüner Veltliner, {{and a host of}} lesser known Vitis vinifera. The region includes two sub-AVAs, the Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA, a single vineyard AVA, as well as the Elkton Oregon AVA, which was established in early 2013.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its <b>warmer</b> <b>climate,</b> attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} development, {{the family}} created a large, new deer park around the castle, {{replacing}} the older, unenclosed hunting grounds. Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth {{for the first time}} chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures. These settlements, comprising long houses built in <b>warmer</b> <b>climate</b> of the 12th and early 13th century, may already have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge {{at the end of the}} 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was used to hold required the packs of dogs for hunting.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1925, Haynes, the Apperson brothers, {{and other}} {{automotive}} pioneers were awarded gold medals by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce at a New York City auto exhibition {{for their contributions}} to the industry. On his return trip home, he contracted influenza and his health began to deteriorate rapidly. In March, he asked his son to take over his business interests while he traveled to Florida to seek rest in the <b>warmer</b> <b>climate.</b> His condition steadily worsened, causing him to cancel his planned trip to Cuba and return to Kokomo. He remained in his home, attended by his personal physician and a nurse until his death from congestive heart failure on April 13, 1925. Haynes' funeral was held in Kokomo before his interment at the city's Memorial Park cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a <b>warmer</b> <b>climate.</b> Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the <b>warmer</b> <b>climate.</b> Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E
5|$|According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles {{experience}} a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Lincolnshire's {{position on the}} east of the Isles allows for a sunnier and <b>warmer</b> <b>climate</b> relative to the national average, and {{it is one of the}} driest counties in the United Kingdom. Although it may vary depending on altitude and proximity to the coast, the mean average temperature for the East of England is approximately 9°C to 10.5°C; the highest temperature recorded in the region was 37.3°C at Cavendish on 10 August 2003. On average, the region experiences 30 days of rainfall in winter and 25 in summer, with 15 days of thunder and 6–8 days of hail per year; on 25 August 2001, hail the size of golf balls were reported in Sleaford and other parts of central Lincolnshire. Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is a gust of wind at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes). Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England than elsewhere in the country; Sleaford experienced tornadoes in 2006 and 2012, both of which caused damage to property.|$|E

40|$|Typhoon Songda (2004), while {{undergoing}} an extratropical {{transition and}} reintensification over the Sea of Japan, spawned serious damages over forest {{areas in the}} northern part of Japan. To clarify influences of anticipated global warming on the typhoon hazard in high-latitude regions, we carried out numerical experiments on Typhoon Songda in a current climate and a pseudo global <b>warming</b> <b>climate</b> and examined the impacts of climate change on the typhoon intensify and windstorms for the region. The typhoon intensity at its maturity becomes stronger in a <b>warming</b> <b>climate,</b> and the typhoon while passing over the Sea of Japan weakens more rapidly in the <b>warming</b> <b>climate.</b> Thus the strong wind over the northern part of Japan in the <b>warming</b> <b>climate</b> also becomes weaker. We examined atmospheric environmental factors in the higher-latitude region: sea surface temperature, vertical shear, and meridional gradient of temperature. It was found that the environmental meridional gradient of temperature at the 500 hPa level is smaller in the <b>warming</b> <b>climate</b> than in the current climate, which indicates that the baroclinicity becomes weak under global warming. The weak baroclinicity makes the typhoon environment unfavorable for the extratropical transition, and therefore, possibly reduces the severity of typhoon wind in northern Japan...|$|R
