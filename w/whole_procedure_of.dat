25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} photographic plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the <b>whole</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{this system}} of {{reciprocal}} preference, at its very outset, must involve conflict with the principle of self-government, which {{is the root of}} all our Colonial and Imperial policy. The <b>whole</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> our Parliament arises primarily from the consideration of finance, and finance is the peg on which nearly all our discussions are hung, and from which many of them arise. That is the historic origin of a great portion of the House of Commons procedure, and there is no more deeply rooted maxim than the maxim of [...] "grievances before supply." [...] Now, let me suppose a system of preference in operation. When the taxes came up to be voted each year, members would use those occasions for debating Colonial questions. I can imagine that they would say: We refuse to vote the preference tax to this or that self-governing Dominion, unless or until our views, say, on native policy or some other question of internal importance to the Dominion affected have been met and have been accepted. At present, it is open to the Colony affected to reply: These matters are matters which concern us; they are within the scope of responsible, self-governing functions, and you are not called upon to interfere. It is open for the Dominion concerned to say that. It is also open for the representative of the Colonial Office in the House of Commons to say that, too, on their behalf.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that the high purity of carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) are hard to obtain because of the impurities, which directly affect their unique properties and potential applications. Some modern purification methods including physical separation methods and chemical oxidation methods {{have been developed for}} getting the CNTs. But either way, each method still has some deficiencies, such as structure damaged, complex steps and low yield. Now there is a comprehensive multi-step method to overcome this predicament, it combines the air oxidation, hydrochloric acid treatment, SDS dispersion, centrifugation process, mixed acid oxidation and H 2 O 2 oxidation.

The comprehensive spectral information, such as Raman shift, width and intensity, are recorded during the <b>whole</b> loading–unloading–reloading <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> CNT fibers. Based on the experimental results, the elastic-plastic deformation evolution of CNT fibers are analyzed at multi-scale levels. It is found that the elastic deformation of the fiber is mainly attributable to the elastic stretching of the CNTs inside the bundles. And the plastic deformation is caused mainly by the slippages at the interfaces among CNTs inside the bundles. Meanwhile, the CNTs deform elastically during the <b>whole</b> loading–unloading–reloading <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Laparoscopic {{splenectomy}} (LS) {{became the}} first <b>procedure</b> <b>of</b> choice in the years of 90 in many institutions. Initially staplers were used to ligate hilar vessels. Recently harmonic scalpels are being used for dissection and ligations. Here we present our experience with vessel sealing device (Ligasure) during <b>whole</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>of</b> dissection in laparoscopic splenectomy. Material and Methods: Between June 2006 and September 2007, 25 children (8 girls and 17 boys) aged 1 - 16 years were hospitalized for laparoscopic splenectomy. Results: Indications for splenectomy were idiopatic thrombocytopenic purpura (n= 10), hereditary spherocytosis (n= 6), thalassemia (n= 8) and autoimmun hemolitic anemia (n= 1). Ultrasonograpically measured spleen length varied between 80 and 192 mm. Three trocars were used for 16 patiens, but a fourth trocar was needed in nine patients. Vessel sealing device was used for sealing and cutting of all vascular structures. Staplers or suture ligation were not necessary. Spleen was put into the retrieval bag and removed from the umbilical trocar site after fragmentation with an ovary forceps. In four patients conversion to open surgery was made because of problems in dissection in two patients, bleeding in one and hypercarbia in another patient although the diseection was completed. Splenic sizes were larger than the sizes given by ultrasonograpy. Operative time was between 45 and 240 minutes (mean 154. 6 minutes). No complication developed except one patient who suffered pleural effusion. Patients were discharged in mean 4. 04 (2 - 12) days. Conclusion: In LS as a gold standart in elective splenecyomy, use of vessel sealing device (Ligasure) {{has a lot of}} advantages including higher comfort provided to the surgeon, reduction in bleeding and thus providing a good view, acceptable decreased length of operation time, being effective and safe method to be applied in children undergoing elective splenectomy...|$|R
