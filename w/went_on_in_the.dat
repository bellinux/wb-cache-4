5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} as time <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was truncated {{to end in}} Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E

25|$|The Holocaust by bullets (as {{opposed to}} the Holocaust by gas) <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}} of occupied Poland {{in conjunction with the}} ghetto uprisings, irrespective of death camps' quota. In two weeks of July 1942 the Słonim Ghetto revolt crushed with the help of Latvian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian Schutzmannschaft cost the lives of 8,000–13,000 Jews. The second largest mass shooting (to that particular date) took place in late October 1942 when the insurgency was suppressed in the Pińsk Ghetto; over 26,000 men, women and children were shot with the aid of Belarusian Auxiliary Police before the ghetto's closure. During the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (the largest single revolt by Jews during World WarII), 13,000 Jews were killed in action before May 1943. Numerous other uprisings were quelled without impacting the pre-planned Nazi deportations actions.|$|E

25|$|Many Gore {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} third-party candidate Nader {{acted as a}} spoiler in the election since Nader votes could have been cast for Gore, and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush. Nader received 2.74 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 overvotes) and 22,000 votes in New Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes. Winning either state would have won the general election for Gore. Defenders of Nader, including Dan Perkins, argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including Workers World Party candidate Monica Moorehead, who received 1,500 votes. But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months leading up to the election.|$|E
25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
25|$|Asquith led {{a deeply}} divided Liberal Party as Prime Minister, not least on {{questions}} of foreign relations and defence spending. Under Balfour, Britain and France had agreed upon the Entente Cordiale. In 1906, {{at the time the}} Liberals took office, there was an ongoing crisis between France and Germany over Morocco, and the French asked for British help in the event of conflict. Grey, the Foreign Secretary, refused any formal arrangement, but gave it as his personal opinion that in the event of war Britain would aid France. France then asked for military conversations aimed at co-ordination in such an event. Grey agreed, and these <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following years, without cabinet knowledge—Asquith most likely did not know of them until 1911. When he learned of them, Asquith was concerned that the French took for granted British aid in the event of war, but Grey persuaded him the talks must continue.|$|E

500|$|NY32B was {{gradually}} truncated as time <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1940s, NY32B was {{cut back on}} its east end to its junction with US4 in Hudson Falls, eliminating its lengthy overlap with US4 along the Hudson River. The route would have been severed from its parent, NY32, as a result; however, NY32 was extended northeastward along US9 from South Glens Falls to NY32B in Glens Falls by this time. On January1, 1949, NY32 was extended east to US4 in Hudson Falls by way of Warren Street, Boulevard, and Feeder Street. The resulting overlap between NY32 and NY32B along Warren Street from downtown Glens Falls to Boulevard remained in place until [...] when NY32B was truncated on its western end to the eastern terminus of the overlap.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{unsuccessful}} {{nature of}} the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006, Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi. Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname [...] "The Cooler" [...] among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves. According to Yankee manager Joe Torre's 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname [...] "A-Fraud" [...] from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands.
