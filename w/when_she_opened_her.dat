6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> {{brown eyes}} again {{she was lying}} on the dry sand beyond the Point, and the young man was on the beach below her, holding both the horses--his own and Tita! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{laid her}} upon the sofa, poured some water over her face, and fanned {{her with a}} newspaper. His {{expression}} of cold indifference remained unmoved. It was there in his face <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, t'at is Dus, my niece. The girl {{is like a}} mocking-pird, {{and catches}} the songs of all {{languages}} and people. She is goot at Dutch, and quite melts my heart, Mortaunt, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> throat to sing one of our melancholy Dutch songs; and she gives the English too, as if she knowet no ot'er tongue." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{searched for}} strawberries, {{but she found}} none, and {{returned}} home in a very bad temper. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> mouth to tell her mother what had befallen her in the wood, a toad jumped out, so that everyone was quite disgusted with her.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes again, and saw {{the patch}} of lights in the distance, {{it seemed to her}} strange that the world still existed, that she was {{standing}} under the bridge resting her head on Gerald's breast. Gerald--who was he? He was the exquisite adventure, the desirable unknown to her.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{recovering}} consciousness {{she first}} felt a sensation of oppression {{in her chest}} and a dull numbness of her whole body. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes she saw Glenn bending over her, holding {{her head on his}} knee. A wet, cold, reviving sensation evidently came from the handkerchief with which he was mopping her face.|$|E
5000|$|Father and son {{are delighted}} by <b>her</b> performances, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> mouth and reveals a very wilful and wayward character, Cornelius is less charmed. The doll demands food, and Mephistopheles indicates, {{that it is}} to be found in the kitchen. While the worthy pair go to fetch it, Mephistopheles converses with Bertha and vanishes into his room.|$|R

5000|$|The film opens {{as school}} pariah, Dina Van Cleve (Jenn Proske) {{walks down the}} hallway of <b>her</b> school. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> locker, a pile of condoms that were put inside as a prank comes falling out.

6000|$|But {{the moment}} Rinaldo saw her, desperate as {{seemed to be}} his condition, he renounced all offers of her assistance; and at length became so exasperated with her good offices, {{especially}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> arms and offered to bear him away in them, that he threatened to cast himself down to the monster {{if she did not}} go away.[11] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{surprise}} of the savages when they found Edith was scarcely, if at all, superior to that of Edith <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes and began to comprehend, somewhat confusedly, her peculiar position. The savages watched her movements, open-mouthed, with intense curiosity, and seemed overjoyed beyond expression when she at length recovered sufficiently to exclaim feebly,--"Where am I? where are you taking me to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Was he fit to {{hear the}} truth? Would he forgive her {{if she did not}} tell it? If she lied about this, could she go on lying to his other questions? When he discovered, later, would not the effect undo the good of lies now? She decided to lie; but, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> lips, simply could not, with his eyes on her; and said faintly: [...] "Yes, they did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can't {{say after}} this that Aunt Adella never gave us anything," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> letter. [...] "Listen, Penelope." ...|$|R
50|$|Later {{they find}} the life raft and Rae shoots it with a flare, setting it on fire.

While Rae struggles, John arrives from below deck. Seeing Rae being attacked, John shoots Hughie in the mouth with a flare, killing him instantly.|$|R
5000|$|When {{starting}} the game up, a cute opening movie comes on. This show a young, shy girl wearing a school uniform {{waiting for a}} train in the Subway. She then notices a vending machine that reads [...] "Online Dance Competition". Her eyes then shift to a young boy dancing to the music from his headphones. The girl looks very intrigued by his moves. The boy notices her and transports her to a blank room. The whole time, the girl keeps <b>her</b> eyes closed. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes <b>open,</b> <b>she</b> is transported to a dance hall. The video is also the same {{as one of the}} Audition Promo videos.|$|R
60|$|Her {{insulting}} taciturnity {{was enough}} sometimes {{to make one}} gnash one's teeth with rage. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> mouth it was only to be abominably rude in harsh tones to the associate of her reprobate father; and the full approval of her aged relative was conveyed to her by offensive chuckles. If not that, then her remarks, always uttered {{in the tone of}} scathing contempt, were of the most appalling inanity.|$|E
60|$|In that sleep he {{remained}} scarcely stirring for full four-and-twenty hours, while Rachel watched by his side, till at length her weariness overcame her, and she slept also. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes again they saw no other light {{than that which}} crept in {{from the mouth of}} the cave. The lamps which always burned there were out. Noie, who was seated near by, heard her stir, and spoke.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes at {{last and}} sat up, Heyst {{scrambled}} quickly {{to his feet}} and went to pick up her cork helmet, which had rolled a little way off. Meanwhile she busied herself in doing up her hair, plaited on {{the top of her head}} in two heavy, dark tresses, which had come loose. He tendered her the helmet in silence, and waited as if unwilling to hear the sound of his own voice.|$|E
5000|$|... 20. Kathy: Kathy hates everyone, {{especially}} the reader (even though she hasn't met the reader), and she hates everybody {{all for a}} specific excuse (with the exception of Sammy, who, as it was revealed six chapters earlier, was a dead rat). It is indicated that she actually creates the excuses by her own actions; she is hit in the face by a ball from Dameon because {{she closes her eyes}} and allows it to hit her, and she dislikes Alison's cookies because one that Kathy left in her own desk for three years became stale and old. She also locks her cat in her closet to prevent it from running away, but in a few days <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> closet, her cat does run away, and Kathy threats that she'll never get another cat as long as she lives. That was why Kathy didn't like Mrs. Jewls.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she looked}} at him. For about a minute neither spoke. I {{could see that the}} {{situation}} was becoming strained. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> did <b>open</b> <b>her</b> beak, it was with a subdued tone, that had a vein of weariness running through it.|$|R

60|$|Everyone listened. Conversations were interrupted; {{glasses were}} put down; eager, {{attentive}} faces {{turned toward the}} speaker; this was no less a personage than Jeanne Poisson now Marquise de Pompadour; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> pretty mouth Louis the Well-beloved, descendant of Saint Louis, King of France and of all her dominions beyond the seas, hung breathless upon those well-rouged lips, whilst France sat silent and listened, eager for a share of that smile which enslaved a King and ruined a nation.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} she thought of <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes in the morning was poor Miss Barbara in the next room, and that dreadful bill; and then, like a flash of lightning, she thought {{of a good thing}} to do for the Thorpedykes. The project which now laid itself out, detail after detail, before her seemed so simple, so sensible, so {{absolutely}} wise and desirable in every way, that she got up, dressed herself with great rapidity, and went in to see Mrs. Cliff.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} a cold, damp face (Grizel was always in such a hurry) <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> most {{precious}} drawer and took from it a certain glove which was wrapped in silk paper, but was not perhaps quite so conceited as it had been, for, alas and alack! it was now used as a wrapper itself. The ring was inside it. If Grizel wanted to be engaged, absolutely and at once, {{all she had to}} do was to slip that ring upon her finger.|$|E
5000|$|She {{can sense}} any woman's cry and {{pain in the}} world and can turn into light and travel at the speed of light. The {{incredible}} amount of energy in her, when released, melts all metals and instantly molds it into shapes and designs as projected by Shakti's mind [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> third eye, situated on her forehead, in anger it beams infernos to burn down the cause of her rage. She is physically the strongest character in the Raj comics universe. She could even carry an airplane with ease and can travel with it at the speed of light. In TRIKALI comic she did time travel to go to the past with her super speed. She also has superhuman strength end endurance.|$|R
5000|$|They {{continue}} walking and, in {{the middle}} of the night, stumble upon Stonehenge, where Tess lies down to rest on an ancient altar. Before she falls asleep, she asks Angel to look after her younger sister, Liza-Lu, saying that she hopes Angel will marry her after she is dead. At dawn, Angel sees that they are surrounded by police. He finally realises that Tess really has committed murder and asks the men in a whisper to let her awaken naturally before they arrest <b>her.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes and sees the police, she tells Angel she is [...] "almost glad" [...] because [...] "now I shall not live for you to despise me". Her parting words are, [...] "I am ready." ...|$|R
30|$|The first example {{takes place}} at Silvana’s home. This takes place in an {{afternoon}} and it’s a moment of contemplation between Silvana and her father. This example develops {{in a period of}} one minute. This interaction begins silently as the father looks intensively at baby Silvana. They are sitting in a couch and looking at each other. Silvana responds, looks back and exchanges gaze. The father is smiling as he holds Silvana’s dummy. He takes in and out the dummy, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> mouth, the father takes the dummy. The father is smiling all through the interaction as he pretend to put in and out the dummy in Silvana’s lips. Silvana responds to this fun and teasing game by opening and closing her mouth, and by making sounds of her own.|$|R
60|$|The {{ubiquitous}} bacon was abroad {{on the air}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Day had broken, {{and with}} it the storm. The wet sun was shining cheerily over the drenched landscape and in at the wide-spread flaps. Already work had begun, and groups of men were filing past under their packs. Frona turned over on her side. Breakfast was cooked. Her host had just put the bacon and fried potatoes in the oven, and was engaged in propping the door ajar with two sticks of firewood.|$|E
60|$|So <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> big bag {{and turned}} out all her Merry Little Breezes {{to play on}} the Green Meadows she sent one of them to see what Sammy Jay was doing in the old {{chestnut}} tree. The Merry Little Breeze danced along over the tree tops just as if he hadn't a thought in the world but to wake up all the little leaves and set them to dancing too, and Sammy Jay, watching Old Mother West Wind and the other Merry Little Breezes, didn't see this Merry Little Breeze at all.|$|E
60|$|The {{incident}} first amused Erlcort, {{and then}} it began to trouble him; but he appeased his remorse by toying with his old notion of a critical bookstore. His mind was still at play with it when {{he stopped at the}} bell-pull of an elderly girl of his acquaintance who had a studio ten stories above, and the habit of giving him afternoon tea in it if he called there about five o'clock. She had her ugly painting-apron still on, and her thumb through the hole in her palette, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> door to him.|$|E
5000|$|... (Mineruba Māsa) is a Defense Member of Venus; {{she arrives}} {{after the other}} members have already settled in at Tenbi. She {{initially}} appears as a carefree airhead who likes to keep her eyes closed in order to look more mature. Her Jingu, Aegis, allows <b>her</b> to <b>open</b> gates to other dimensions. She can make limbs disappear from and reappear in the current dimension so as to stop physical attacks. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes, <b>she</b> emits an inexhaustible stream of Element that engulfs everyone and creates a territory where she can further use powers such as selectively making the clothing of the girls disappear. She thus proclaims herself the Master of Lingerie. Minori ranks Minerva the highest of the ability users. She is voiced by Rina Sato in the Japanese version, and by Leah Clark in the English dub.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} eyes for several moments. For some reason or other, this last {{reflection}} seemed to bring her no particular relief. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>opened</b> them again, <b>her</b> decision was written in her face.|$|R
50|$|Batman recovers her heart, and Dr. Mid-Nite restores {{it to her}} body; {{however, the}} doctor also makes a {{prognosis}} on whether she can still return to her former life swinging through rooftops. While Selina is still in a coma, she encounters Zatanna, who apologizes for not warning her about Hush. She tells Selina {{that she was so}} happy about her relationship with Bruce that she ignored the other warnings in the cards. Zatanna gives her a little bottle supposedly containing aloe vera for her post-op scars. It is hinted that there is a little magic in there to help Selina with her recovery. Selina is sad that she might end up alone again. In the meantime, Bruce enters the recovery room and, believing her unconscious, launches into a soliloquy. He ends by telling Selina that he will always love <b>her,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> eyes and reveals to him that she was awake all the time and heard his confession.|$|R
