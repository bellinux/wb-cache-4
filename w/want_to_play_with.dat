Frasier becomes obsessed with winning against his father until Frasier wins one match and Martin does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> Frasier anymore. One late night, Frasier wakes Martin up and asks him whether he lost the chess match on purpose. Martin responds that Frasier [...] "won, fair and square" [...] and nothing more.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Walter Judson {{noted that}} they {{preferred}} to train their own craftsmen {{and that it was}} difficult to find people fully interested in the craft: [...] "They just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> it and then go off." [...] By 1981, Judson Studios was still using “the old methods that have yet to be improved.” [...] Walter Judson noted, [...] "We do use a lot more electricity and glass costs a lot more but that’s about all that’s changed." [...] At the time, Judson was using glass {{from all over the world}} in more than 600 colors.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the dynamic between the {{characters}} would continue to progress, de Pablo remarked, [...] "I {{have a feeling that}} they're going to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> that [...] a little bit more and see where that goes. I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [...] It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all. I like things the way they are, so I'm not in [...] that. I'm petitioning against it." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time in Japan's postwar history, bureaucrats lost their leading role. In 1985 Nakasone {{appointed}} the former governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruo Maekawa, to head a commission on Japan's economic future. In 1986 the Commission recommended that Japan should grow not through exports (which were angering Japan's trading partners) but from within. Nakasone advised the Japanese public to purchase foreign imports; in a well publicised shopping trip, he bought an American tennis racket, an Italian tie and a French shirt. He said [...] "Japan is like a mah-jong player who always wins. Sooner or later the other players will decide that they do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> him". The Japanese public were sceptical but the Commission created a good impression abroad, especially in America, where the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs W. Allen Wallis called it a watershed in Japan's postwar economic policy.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Battle.net-enabled games, Warcraft III introduced anonymous matchmaking, automatically pairing {{players for}} games {{based on their}} skill level and game type preferences, preventing players from cheating and inflating their records artificially. If players <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> a friend in ranked matches, Warcraft III offers [...] "Arranged Team Games", where a team joins a lobby and Battle.net will search for another team; as with anonymous matchmaking, the enemy team is not known beforehand. Players can also host custom games, using maps either created in the Warcraft III World Editor, or the default multiplayer scenarios. The game also offers Friends Lists and Channels for chatting, where players can create custom channels or join Blizzard-approved ones. Warcraft III also allows players to band together to form [...] "clans", which can participate in tournaments or offer a recreational aspect to Warcraft III.

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these ‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{returned}} {{the group to}} the U.S. charts one last time, peaking at No.179. For a few shows at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Ferguson re-joined the group. Disaster struck, however, when an inebriated Neil Young walked onto stage to join the band during the final show's encore of [...] "Like a Rolling Stone." [...] California would later claim that he didn't recognize Young, {{but at the time}} was angry with Young for upstaging what he saw as his own comeback. California moved over in front of Neil and began pushing him backwards, away from the microphone, back past the drumkit and offstage. Young, along with a host of music and film luminaries, including New Hollywood director Hal Ashby, had been hanging out with the band backstage before they went on, and Locke (a friend of Young) had invited the guitarist to join them in their encore. When Locke saw California pushing Young offstage, he got up from his piano and said that he had had enough and didn't ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> California again, walking off stage. Cassidy initially quelled the situation by leaving his kit and physically pulling both California and Young back onstage to the microphone to close out the song, asking the audience to sing along with them. The audience stood, stunned at the scene that was playing out before them. After finishing the song, the band members argued backstage over what had unfolded. The damage had been done, and the reunion ended that night.|$|E
