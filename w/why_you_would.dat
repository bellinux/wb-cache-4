500|$|Reception of the preview {{release of}} RT 8.1 was mixed; both ExtremeTech and TechRadar praised the {{improvements}} to the operating system's tablet-oriented interface, along {{with the addition of}} Outlook; TechRadars Dan Grabham believed that the inclusion of Outlook was important because [...] "nobody {{in their right mind would}} try and handle work email inside the standard Mail app—it's just not up to the task." [...] However, both experienced performance issues running the beta on the Tegra 3-based Surface; ExtremeTech concluded that [...] "as it stands, we’re still not sure <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever opt to buy a Windows RT tablet when there are similarly priced Atom-powered x86 devices that run the full version of Windows 8." ...|$|E
500|$|Leaf {{missed his}} second season due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered 20 minutes into the Chargers' first training camp workout on July 23, 1999. Leaf had surgery to fix a labral tear in his throwing shoulder. During an August training camp, a fan heckled Leaf: [...] "Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star." [...] Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying [...] "No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it." [...] Leaf later explained the incident: [...] "...what I {{wanted to do was}} say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to understand <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say that about me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Abrams, of Rogerebert.com, {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review; he awarded {{three out of}} four stars, and praised the film's choreography and fight scenes. He said that [...] "while time hasn't been kind to the best ass-kicking knuckle-draggers, Skin Trade is energetic, and winsome." [...] In his opinion, the movie hails from a [...] "decadent period of action cinema [...] when every renegade cop had a private vendetta, a pet charity/social concern, and a few lousy quips in his back pocket." [...] He summed up his review by saying: [...] "ou can teach a new dog old tricks, though <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> want to is anyone's guess." [...] The Action Elite's Eoin Friel also enjoyed the film; he awarded four out of five stars, and praised the choreography, stunts and fight scenes. Unlike Schager or Vishnevetsky, Friel had no issues with Jaa's fluency in English, and even felt he [...] "handled English pretty well".|$|E

So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter against the Oilers in 1973, Butkus pounced on a fumble in the end zone for the only {{touchdown}} of his career. Houston tight end Mack Alston accused Butkus of intimidating the officials, saying he [...] "grabbed the ball and started yelling 'touchdown, touchdown, after which [...] "the officials looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and called it a touchdown." [...] His season was cut short after nine games by a lingering right knee injury, which he had been playing through for years, but was further agitated after it gave out in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons. Prior to the 1974 season an orthopedic surgeon told him, [...] "I don't know how a man in your shape can play football or <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> even want to." [...] The injury ultimately forced him to retire in May 1974 at age 31.|$|E
