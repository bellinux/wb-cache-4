5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E

He consults his sister Meg for her opinion and she lists her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.|$|E
5|$|Ebner has {{additionally}} written narrative fiction (novels, short stories, short prose), {{essays and}} poems. His poetry {{is written in}} German and Catalan. Supported by a subsidy for literature from the Austrian government, he went to Andorra in 2007 to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> about {{the country in the}} Pyrenees. He also translated the novel L'Absent written by the Catalan author Josep Navarro Santaeulàlia, into German. Ebner's cultural essays about Catalan culture, such as that of Barcelona and Andorra, have been published by the magazines Literatur und Kritik and Zitig. His first collection of short stories, Lose (Destinies), was published in 2007. Of its 45 stories, twenty-two had already been printed in newspapers, literary magazines or anthologies. In 2008, Ebner published two other books of narrative fiction, among them the short novel Hominide.|$|E

5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
5|$|The Tang Empire was at {{its height}} of power up {{until the middle of}} the 8th century, when the An Lushan Rebellion (December 16, 755 – February 17, 763) {{destroyed}} the prosperity of the empire. An Lushan was a half-Sogdian, half-Turk Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the Khitans of Manchuria with a victory in 744, yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful. He was given great responsibility in Hebei, which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than one hundred thousand troops. After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, Yan state. Despite early victories scored by Tang General Guo Ziyi (697–781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's die-hard frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an. While the heir apparent raised troops in Shanxi and Xuanzong fled to Sichuan province, they called upon the help of the Uyghur Khaganate in 756. The Uyghur khan Moyanchur was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride. The Uyghurs helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk. Even Abbasid Arabs assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion. The Tibetans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the Tibetan Empire had fallen apart in 842 (and the Uyghurs soon after) the Tang were in no position to reconquer Central Asia after 763. So significant was this loss that half a century later jinshi examination candidates were required to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> on the causes of the Tang's decline. Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757, this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel Shi Siming was killed by his own son in 763.|$|E

25|$|The {{rhetoric and}} {{composition}} pedagogy {{developed in the}} late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as “CTR.” CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product—the “essay”— which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits “discovery procedures,” diminishes the “importance of the writer,” and restricts writer engagement with audience. Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31) In {{an experiment}} designed to examine attitude {{change in the}} communicator {{as a function of}} the prior opinions and nature of his audience three variables, each with two levels, were studied: the prestige of an audience (high and low), the perceived beliefs of that audience (pro and con) and the type of essay subjects were to write (proattitudinal and counterattitudinal). All essays concerned the dispensation of birth control pills by the Student Health Center. It was predicted that subjects' post speech opinions on the topic would be affected by the prior opinions of his audience only when the audience was high in prestige. This hypothesis was not supported. It was found, unexpectedly, that subjects who <b>wrote</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> to <b>a</b> low prestige audience changed their private attitudes to a greater extent than subjects who <b>wrote</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> to <b>a</b> high prestige audience. It was also found that both audience position and type of essay significantly affected subject's tendency to drop out of the experiment. Subjects who <b>wrote</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> to <b>an</b> audience thought to oppose the dispensation of birth control pills by the Student Health Center or who <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> counterattitudinal <b>essay</b> "dropped out" to a greater extent than those subjects who <b>wrote</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay</b> to <b>a</b> pro audience or <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> pro-attitudinal <b>essay...</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It {{has been said about}} our modern times that, 'Invention is the mother of necessity.'

[...] In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is your role model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges.

500|$|Stone {{then tried}} to gain {{practical}} speaking experience. Although women students could debate {{each other in their}} literary society, it was considered inappropriate for them to participate in oral exercises with men; women members of the collegiate rhetoric class were expected to learn by observing their male classmates. So Stone and first-year student Antoinette Brown, who also wanted to develop skill in public speaking, organized an off-campus women’s debating club. After gaining a measure of competence, they sought and received permission to debate each other before Stone’s rhetoric class. The debate attracted a large student audience as well as attention from the Faculty Board, which thereupon formally banned women’s oral exercises in coeducational classes. Shortly thereafter, Stone accepted a challenge from a former editor of a county newspaper to a public debate on women’s rights, and she soundly defeated him. She then submitted a petition to the Faculty Board, signed by most members of her graduating class, asking that women chosen to write graduation essays be permitted to read them themselves, as men so honored did, instead of having them read by faculty members. When the Faculty Board refused and Stone was elected to <b>write</b> <b>an</b> <b>essay,</b> she declined, saying she could not support a principle that denied women “the privilege of being co-laborers with men in any sphere to which their ability makes them adequate.” ...|$|E
