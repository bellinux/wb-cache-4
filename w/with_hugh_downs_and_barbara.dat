50|$|Barbara Walters, {{though not}} the first to cross the line between news and {{personality}} stories, is for many the quintessential news-media icon. Her career dates back to the 1950s, and her current prominence at ABC is largely due to celebrity interviews, with a long running co-anchorship on 20/20 <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and,</b> later, John Stossel until 2004, and her overlapping morning infotainment show The View.|$|R

In addition to continuing with his technical and production innovations, Eddy initiated many highly popular programs, including Junior Jamboree (puppeteers, later becoming Kukla, Fran and Ollie), the Chicago Zoo with Marlin Perkins (later Wild Kingdom), news <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> <b>and</b> the first live broadcasts of many sports: baseball (Chicago Cubs remote from Wrigley Field), college football (Notre Dame remote from South Bend), boxing, wrestling, and golf.|$|R

However, on January 3, 1777, in a skirmish {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Princeton, <b>with</b> General <b>Hugh</b> Mercer <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wounded, Haslet tried to rally Mercer's brigade and was himself shot in the head and killed instantly. Nevertheless, they did rally and a surprising victory was won to complement the earlier one at Trenton. The [...] "corps of loyalists" [...] he defeated at Mamaroneck was led by the famous Indian fighter Robert Rogers (soldier). Legend has it that Washington wept over his corpse on the battlefield and notes by Washington's stepson confirm that Washington did come across Haslet's body at Princeton, but does not mention any shedding of tears.|$|R

The only exception was an interview <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> but that was during the post-race coverage. In addition, Luke Walton interviewed Evel Knievel in the pit area {{during the early stages}} of the race. Knievel was making his first visit to the 500, as a guest of the A. J. Foyt team.|$|R

In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, {{and all of its}} 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).|$|R

50|$|Edd Hall {{served as}} {{announcer}} on The Tonight Show from 1992 until 2004. Hall occasionally appeared in skits {{during the opening}} monologue. These skits often involved slapstick injury to Hall (by using a stunt double, dummy, or film clip), such as vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot. Unlike his predecessors on Tonight (i.e. McMahon <b>with</b> Carson, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>with</b> Jack Paar), Hall did not serve as a sidekick for Leno during his tenure on Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show.|$|R

The original network daytime series, Concentration, appeared on NBC for 14 years, 7 months, and 3,770 telecasts (August 25, 1958 - March 23, 1973), the longest run of any game show on that network (Wheel of Fortune was a month shy of tying that record when the initial NBC run ended on June 30, 1989). This series was hosted by <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> later by Bob Clayton, but for a six-month period in 1969, Ed McMahon hosted the series. The series began at 11:30 AM Eastern, then moved to 11:00 and finally to 10:30. Nearly all episodes of the NBC daytime version were produced at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City.|$|R

Maddox likened the write-in to an attempt to [...] "slip into the back door like a thief in the night" [...] and called upon Arnall to renounce the drive. Several celebrities endorsed the Arnall write-in, including television personality <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> singers Peter, Paul, and Mary, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis, Jr. The Georgia civil rights activist Hosea Williams challenged Callaway on a myriad of issues important to liberals and claimed that the Republican nominee had purchased the endorsement of the Atlanta Journal.|$|R
2500|$|From 1952 to 1964, {{a notable}} {{member of the}} cast was a woman, often an entertainer, the Today Girl.

He {{had led the}} {{proposal}} team and as director of engineering and operations, he oversaw the Apollo program at AC Spark Plug. The program included a guidance and navigation system, an optical system, and a computer. Atwood's organization became the prime contractor. When asked about his contribution to the Apollo Program, Atwood would always downplay his contribution and let his people take the credit. In fact his contribution was [...] "tremendous" [...] said Hugh Brady, Atwood's program manager for Apollo. Atwood was involved with NASA at the launches at Cape Kennedy, led the negotiations for getting contracts and had total management responsibility. His interface with General Motors management was also {{very important to the}} program. Atwood also represented General Motors on nationwide television's Today Show <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs.</b> Atwood would reflect later that it was this appearance was his [...] "greatest risk". Atwood spent 30 minutes explaining to an anxious 20 million viewers what was happening with the Apollo 8 astronauts as they circled incommunicado around {{the far side of the}} Moon on Christmas Eve morning, 1968.|$|R

Some of his most memorable sketches included vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot, getting [...] "attacked" [...] by actors in large animal costumes, or Leno would discover Hall [...] "missing" [...] from the studio and would go in search of him - eventually finding Edd in a ridiculous place or situation.|$|R

5000|$|Walters {{first became}} known as a {{television}} personality in the early 1960s, {{when she was a}} writer and segment producer of [...] "women's interest stories" [...] on the NBC News morning program The Today Show, where she began work <b>with</b> host <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs.</b> As a result of her outstanding interviewing ability and her popularity with viewers, she received more airtime on the program. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the program, she had no input in choosing a successor for Downs when he left in 1971, and Frank McGee was hired. In 1974, at the time of McGee's death, Walters became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a title on an American news program.|$|R

In her autobiography, she describes this era before the Women's Movement as {{a time when it was}} believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting [...] "hard news". Previous [...] "Today Girls" [...] (whom Walters called [...] "tea pourers") included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons and Lee Meriwether. Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews. One very well received film segment was [...] "A Day in the Life of a Novice Nun," [...] edited by then first assistant film editor Donald Swerdlow (now Don Canaan) who was subsequently promoted to become a full film editor at NBC News. She had a great relationship <b>with</b> host <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> for years. When Frank McGee was named host, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974, when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host.|$|R

When Riggs was contacted to take Parisyan's place he jumped at the chance, despite having fought at UFC 55 just a month earlier.

Despite his efforts, Riggs could not mount a significant challenge; <b>Hughes</b> took him <b>down</b> <b>and</b> submitted him with a kimura from half-guard just minutes into {{the first round of the}} fight.|$|R

Dave Garroway (1913–1982) also arrived on the NBC airwaves via WMAQ with his 1160 Club playing big band and jazz in the 1940s. Garroway was also responsible for organizing a series of local jazz concerts and establishing a Chicago lounge [...] "Jazz Circuit" [...] in 1947 which revived interest in the music genre.
