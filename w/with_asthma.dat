Cytokine production was assessed in supernatants by using the Cytometric Bead Array. Patients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma</b> were subsequently randomized to oral calcitriol or placebo therapy, and identical studies were repeated. ResultsPatients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma</b> produced significantly increased IL- 17 A and IFN-γ levels compared with those in patients <b>with</b> SS <b>asthma,</b> although it was evident that cells from individual patients might overproduce {{one or the other of}} these cytokines. Production of IL- 17 A was inversely and production of IL- 13 was positively associated with the clinical response to prednisolone. Oral calcitriol, compared with placebo, therapy of the patients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma</b> significantly improved dexamethasone-induced IL- 10 production in vitro while suppressing dexamethasone-induced IL- 17 A production. This effect mirrored the previously demonstrated improvement in clinical response to oral glucocorticoids in calcitriol-treated patients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma.</b> ConclusionsIL- 17 Ahigh and IFN-γhigh immunophenotypes exist in patients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma.</b> These data identify immunologic pathways that likely underpin the beneficial clinical effects of calcitriol in patients <b>with</b> SR <b>asthma</b> by directing the SR cytokine profile toward a more SS immune phenotype, suggesting strategies for identifying vitamin D responder immunophenotypes...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those <b>with</b> <b>asthma</b> or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions.

Methods: Bronchial and transbronchial biopsies from healthy controls, patients with controlled atopic and patients <b>with</b> uncontrolled atopic <b>asthma</b> were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix molecules: collagen, versican, biglycan, decorin, fibronectin, EDA-fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 and tissue-inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3. Results: In central airways we found increased percentage areas of versican and decorin in patients <b>with</b> uncontrolled <b>asthma</b> compared to both healthy controls and patients <b>with</b> controlled <b>asthma.</b> Percentage area of biglycan was significantly higher in both central airways and alveolar parenchyma of patients with uncontrolled compared to controlled asthma.

BACKGROUND: Diffuse airway mucus {{obstruction}} is an important feature of severe and fatal asthma. MUC 5 AC and MUC 5 B are the principal gel-forming mucins found in airway mucus. The mucin composition of airway mucus likely affects its functional properties. METHODS: We quantified the principal airway mucins MUC 5 AC and MUC 5 B in the sputum of age-matched children with acute and stable asthma and healthy control subjects by using Western blotting. RESULTS: Sputum samples from 38 children (13 <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma,</b> 15 <b>with</b> stable <b>asthma,</b> 10 control subjects) were obtained. Sputum MUC 5 AC concentrations were 7. 6 μg/mL in control subjects, 22. 4 μg/mL in those <b>with</b> stable <b>asthma</b> (P =. 17), and 44. 7 μg/mL in those <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma</b> (P <. 05). MUC 5 B concentrations showed less variation, with 156. 2, 222. 3, and 254. 8 μg/mL in control subjects, those <b>with</b> stable <b>asthma,</b> and those <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma,</b> respectively. The greater MUC 5 AC concentration in those <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma</b> resulted in a significantly altered MUC 5 B:MUC 5 AC ratio between control subjects and those <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma</b> (P <. 05). Significant differences in MUC 5 B glycoforms were present between the groups, with the low-charge-only glycoform being found uniquely in those <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Increased MUC 5 AC and the presence of a low-charge-only MUC 5 B glycoform significantly altered mucin composition in children <b>with</b> acute <b>asthma.</b> These changes may be important contributory factors to the airway mucus obstruction observed during acute asthma.

Healthy individuals and patients <b>with</b> allergic <b>asthma</b> were experimentally infected with low-dose (10 TCID 50) rhinovirus 16. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and exhaled breath condensate (for mass spectrometry by UPLC-MS/MS) were obtained before and after rhinovirus challenge. IDO activity was not induced by rhinovirus infection in either group, despite increases in cold scores. However, baseline pulmonary IDO activity was lower in patients <b>with</b> allergic <b>asthma</b> than in healthy individuals. In contrast, systemic tryptophan and its catabolites were markedly higher in patients <b>with</b> allergic <b>asthma.</b> Moreover, systemic quinolinic acid and tryptophan were associated with eosinophil cationic protein (r= 0. 43 and r= 0. 78, respectively) and eosinophils (r= 0. 38 and r= 0. 58, respectively) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peak asthma symptom scores after rhinovirus challenge (r= 0. 53 and r= 0. 64, respectively).

MethodsBronchial brushings from 40 participants in the Bronchoscopic Exploratory Research Study of Biomarkers in Corticosteroid-refractory Asthma (BOBCAT) study were evaluated by using 16 S ribosomal RNA–based methods. Relationships to clinical and inflammatory features were analyzed among microbiome-profiled subjects. Secondarily, bacterial compositional profiles were compared between patients <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma</b> and previously studied healthy control subjects (n =  7) and patients <b>with</b> mild-to-moderate <b>asthma</b> (n =  41). ResultsIn patients <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma,</b> bronchial bacterial composition was associated with several disease-related features, including body mass index (P < . 05, Bray-Curtis distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance; PERMANOVA), changes in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores (P < . 01), sputum total leukocyte values (P = . 06), and bronchial biopsy eosinophil values (per square millimeter, P = . 07). Bacterial communities associated with worsening ACQ scores and sputum total leukocyte values (predominantly Proteobacteria) differed markedly from those associated with body mass index (Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes). In contrast, improving/stable ACQ scores and bronchial epithelial gene expression of FK 506 binding protein (FKBP 5), an indicator of steroid responsiveness, correlated with Actinobacteria. Mostly negative correlations were observed between biopsy eosinophil values and Proteobacteria. No taxa were associated with a TH 2 -related epithelial gene expression signature, but expression of TH 17 -related genes was associated with Proteobacteria.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess IL- 13 expression in sputum and bronchial biopsy specimens from subjects <b>with</b> mild-to-severe <b>asthma.</b> METHODS: Sputum IL- 13 concentrations were measured in 32 control subjects, 34 subjects <b>with</b> mild <b>asthma,</b> 21 subjects <b>with</b> moderate <b>asthma,</b> and 26 subjects <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma.</b> Enumeration of mast cells, eosinophils, and IL- 13 + cells in the bronchial submucosa and airway smooth muscle (ASM) bundle was performed in 7 control subjects, 14 subjects <b>with</b> mild <b>asthma,</b> 7 subjects <b>with</b> moderate <b>asthma,</b> and 7 subjects <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma.</b> RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with measurable IL- 13 in the sputum was increased in the mild asthma group (15 / 34) and severe asthma group (10 / 26) compared with that seen {{in the control group}} (4 / 32; P =. 004). IL- 13 + cells were increased within the submucosa in all asthma severity groups compared with control subjects (P =. 006). The number of IL- 13 + cells were increased within the ASM bundle in the severe <b>asthma</b> group compared <b>with</b> that seen in the other groups (P <. 05). Asthma control questionnaire scores positively correlated with sputum IL- 13 concentrations (R(s) = 0. 35, P =. 04) and mast cells in the ASM bundle (R(s) = 0. 7, P =. 007). IL- 13 + cells within the submucosa and ASM correlated with sputum eosinophilia (R(s) = 0. 4, P < or =. 05). CONCLUSIONS: IL- 13 overexpression in sputum and bronchial biopsy specimens is a feature of severe asthma...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tumour {{necrosis}} factor {alpha} (TNF{alpha}) {{is a major}} therapeutic {{target in}} a range of chronic inflammatory disorders characterised by a Th 1 type immune response in which TNF{alpha} is generated in excess. By contrast, asthma is regarded as a Th 2 type disorder, especially when associated with atopy. However, as asthma becomes more severe and chronic, it adopts additional characteristics including corticosteroid refractoriness and involvement of neutrophils suggestive of an altered inflammatory profile towards a Th 1 type response, incriminating cytokines such as TNF{alpha}. Methods: TNF{alpha} levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 26 healthy controls, 42 subjects <b>with</b> mild <b>asthma</b> and 20 <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma</b> were measured by immunoassay, and TNF{alpha} gene expression was determined in endobronchial biopsy specimens from 14 patients <b>with</b> mild <b>asthma</b> and 14 <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma.</b> The cellular localisation of TNF{alpha} was assessed by immunohistochemistry. An open label uncontrolled clinical study was then undertaken in 17 subjects <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma</b> to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with the soluble TNF{alpha} receptor-IgG 1 Fc fusion protein, etanercept. Results: TNF{alpha} levels in BAL fluid, TNF{alpha} gene expression and TNF{alpha} immunoreative cells were increased in subjects with severe corticosteroid dependent asthma. Etanercept treatment was associated <b>with</b> improvement in <b>asthma</b> symptoms, lung function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Conclusions: These findings may be of clinical significance in identifying TNF{alpha} as a new therapeutic target in subjects <b>with</b> severe <b>asthma.</b> The effects of anti-TNF treatment now require confirmation in placebo controlled studies...|$|R
