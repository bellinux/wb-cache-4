The analysis was carried out on the basis of daily thermal data (the average daily air temperature, the minimum and maximum daily air temperature), cloudiness and precipitation. The data was obtained from a meteorological station belonging to the Department of Climatology at the Faculty of Earth Sciences at the University of Silesia. <b>Weather</b> <b>types</b> were established according to <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> classification after Woś (2010). 48 <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> were specified {{on the basis of a}} combination of 3 selected meteorological elements (temperature, cloudiness, precipitation). The number of days in the year and the frequency of particular thermal <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> <b>weather</b> subtype, weather classes and <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> were characterized, and the changeability of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> was analyzed. Furthermore, sequences of days with specific <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> were described. The analysis conducted has lead to the conclusion that, during the research period, the weather structure for the city of Sosnowiec was characterized by a great number of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> observed, with relatively low frequency of occurrence. Weather throughout the year was dominated by warm <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> (3 [...] , 2 [...] , 2 [...] ), with weather marked as 310 – very warm, moderately cloudy, without precipitation (12. 9 %) recorded as the most frequent, followed by 221 – moderately warm, very cloudy, with precipitation (11. 6 %), and 210 – moderately warm, moderately cloudy, without precipitation (11. 4 %) as the least frequent one. A diversification in the number of particular classification units in consecutive years of the examined 15 -year period does not display significant variability.

We investigated the effect modification of aeroallergens on the association between CO, O 3, NO 2, SO 2, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and asthma hospitalisation rates in seven synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> We developed single air pollutant models, adjusted for the effect of aeroallergens and stratified by synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> and pooled relative risk estimates for asthma hospitalisation in ten Canadian cities.

However, aeroallergens did not significantly modify relative risk for any pollutant in the DT or MT <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> or for PM 10 in any <b>weather</b> <b>type.</b> Thus, there is a modifying effect of aeroallergens on the association between CO, O 3, NO 2, SO 2, PM 2. 5 and asthma hospitalisations that differs under specific synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} relationship between Lamb-Jenkinson <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and surface ozone concentration variation, thus widening the application of the <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> analysis of air quality at 4 sites in this region. The long-range transport patterns associated with high-ozone events were classified into trajectories from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and in the vicinity of southern Sweden (VIC). The VIC type, characterized by short and whirling curves, represented more than 40 % of the high-ozone events at the studied rural sites. More than half of the high-ozone events occurred under high-pressure condi-tions, belonging to <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> A (anticyclones). The high correlation coefficient between annual counts of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> A and those of long-range transport pattern VIC confirmed the strong link between stagnant weather conditions and high-ozone events, especially during the summer. Furthermore, a strong linear anticorrelation was detected between high-ozone events and annual counts of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> C (cyclones) during the summer. This relationship implies that the frequency of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> C is a useful indicator for low risk of summertime high-ozone events in southern Sweden.

Determination of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the Northwest Anatolia was carried out by interpretations of the synoptic maps (00 : 00 GMT), atmospheric events and climatic elements. Thirteen <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> that are occurred depending on seven genetic systems were determined for the study area.

40|$|The present PhD {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the study of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> that occur over two Greek stations, Athens and Thessaloniki. More specifically, the aim of the study is to distinguish primary weather patterns so that the investigation into the relationship between weather patterns and circulation types will be more effective. For this purpose, data of several surface meteorological parameters have been employed in addition to NCEP/NCAR data referring to the 500 hPa level and finally the calendar of an automatic classification of circulation types according to Maheras et al (2000 a). On the first step, the Besancenot (1990) classification of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> has been applied for both of the stations. A new classification of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> has been created {{as a result of the}} low or even zero frequencies of occurrence for some of the Besancenot <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> as well as the very high percentage of occurrence of the “unfavorable conditions” <b>weather</b> <b>type.</b> The new grouping of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> reflects better the conditions over the two Greek stations. Twelve <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> have been created for the cold and eleven for the warm period of the year. Significant differences are observed mainly due to the particular characteristics of each meteorological parameter at each of the stations. Rainy days are more in Thessaloniki whereas the overall amount of precipitation is higher in Athens. During the warm period the days that are related with episodes of discomfort feeling are relatively higher in Thessaloniki. Furthermore, a new method for the automatic classification of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> is presented which combines meteorological parameters, reflecting air mass characteristics at the surface, with synoptic conditions prevailing over an area. Five quantitative meteorological parameters are used in the procedure: temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind velocity and sunshine duration. In addition, two qualitative variables related to the prevailing circulation type and whether it is cyclonic or anticyclonic are also included. <b>Weather</b> <b>types</b> are defined using a relatively new method of cluster analysis, Two-Step Cluster Analysis, which allows the simultaneous use of both quantitative and qualitative variables. For Athens, six <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are created, whereas for Thessaloniki five are produced. For both stations, only two <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are related to anticyclonic situations. The majority of the identified <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> correspond to a distinctive and well-defined synoptic situation. Each <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> differs from the others, not only in terms of the circulation conditions referring to it, but also with reference to meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation. Finally, Discriminant Analysis is applied in order to determine the relationships between circulation types in the middle troposphere and prevailing <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> By means of a Stepwise Discriminant Analysis model, the most important variables from the 500 hPa level are found and are used to generate the necessary functions that can discriminate <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> over the two stations. The first function discriminates the days into cyclonic and anticyclonic ones, the second function dissociates two of the most predominant <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> according to the position (latitude and longitude) of the center of the circulation type while the rest of the functions use appropriate grid points parameters in order to separate the rest of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> with regard to their thermo-dynamical characteristics. The results of the evaluation of the aforementioned procedure are considered to be very satisfactory (> 80 %). ...|$|R

40|$|A set of 12 daily <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> {{has been}} {{obtained}} for the New Zealand region from the 51 -year NCAR/NCEP dataset by using a two-stage classification procedure (rotated T-mode principal component analysis followed by convergent K-means clustering). Analysis of this classification confirms previous studies and provides further insight into the variation features of the regional synoptic weather on the seasonal, interannual and longer-time scales. There are seasonal variations in both intensity and frequency of synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> For example, southern highs are more frequent in summer and autumn, while troughs and lows occur more often in winter and secondarily spring. The high and low centres of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> {{tend to be more}} intense in winter than summer. The frequency and lifetime of synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> fluctuate on the interannual and decadal scales; there exist significant correlations between frequencies of individual <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In all seasons, the frequencies of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> can change with phases of SOI. The most significant changes in <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> frequencies during the negative SOI phase occur in spring, and characterized by more frequent occurrence of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> which provide prevailing southwesterly to westerly winds and reduced prominence of anticyclonic situations. The most significant changes in type frequencies during the positive SOI phase occur in summer, with more frequent anticyclonic types but less frequent cyclonic types. The frequency change in winter seems different from other seasons, although consistent with previous studies. In addition, the probability of extremely frequent occurrence or lack of occurrence of certain <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> during a month also varies significantly with S OI phases and with seasons, indicating that the chance for extreme weather conditions to occur is conditional on SOI. The results can be useful for climate forecasts, studies of climate extremes, air pollution, climatic impacts on human health and other environmental problems. 17 page(s...|$|R

ObjectiveTo investigate the air pollution–mortality relationship within <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and seasons, and to determine which combination of atmospheric conditions may pose increased health threats in the elderly age categories. MethodsThe relative risk of mortality (RR) due to air pollution was examined using Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) within specific <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Analysis was completed by <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and age group (all ages, ≤ 64, 65 – 74, 75 – 84, ≥ 85 years) in ten Canadian cities from 1981 to 1999. ResultsThere was significant modification of RR by <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and age. When examining the entire population, <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O 3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> with the all-age RR of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1. 055 (95 % CI 1. 026 – 1. 085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). On average, RR increased by 2. 6, 3. 8 and 1. 5 % for the respective pollutants between the ≤ 64 and ≥ 85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days. ConclusionsWe identified a significant modification of RR for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Efforts should be targeted at minimizing pollutant exposure to the elderly and/or all age groups with respect to <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> in question...|$|R

The seasonal contribution of each synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> to the aerosol concentration was deduced from the aerosol annual cycles while the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence was estimated by means of the diurnal cycles. Since aerosols are scavenged by precipitation, the diurnal cycle of the CO concentration was also used to identify polluted air masses. SO 2 and NO x concentrations were used as precursor tracers for new particle formation and growth, respectively. The aerosol optical parameters and number concentration show elevated loadings during advective <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> during the December–March period and for the convective anticyclonic and convective indifferent <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> during the April–September period.

This paper presents examples of classifications of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> based on atmospheric circulation data from 1881 - 1993. These <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are defined by an objective statistical method introduced by Lund (1963). The method aims to classify every day in terms of one of 10 - 15 different <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> The data used are daily-gridded sea level pressure (SLP) data on a 10 ° latitude, 5 ° longitude grid in the area 70 °W- 50 °E, 30 °N- 85 °N (North Atlanti c and Europe). Each pressure map is correlated to every other pressure map and correlation coefficients r (i,j) are calculated. Thus, two identical maps give r (i,j) = 1. It is considered {{reasonable to assume that}} the better the correlation, the greater is the similarity between the two weather situations represented by the pressure maps. Hence, it is reasonable to include all situations showing a high degree of correlation in the same <b>weather</b> <b>type.</b> A close relationship exists between the <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and <b>weather</b> elements (air temperature, radiation, precipitation) for a given location.

40|$|A low-lying {{country as}} The Netherland {{is prone to}} coastal flooding, and its risk may be {{enhanced}} by global-warming induced climate change. Sea level rise has been historically considered as the key factor in coastal retreat, but waves also play an important erosive role along the coast, which can also {{be affected by the}} changing climate. During the last years, important advances have been achieved in climate modeling, with a very detailed characterization of the different components of the climate system, for the present and for different future scenarios. However, characterization of future ocean waves is still a matter of discussion and ongoing research. In this thesis, a statistical downscaling methodology based on <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> has been chosen to model the present wave climate and explore potential changes in future waves. These changes are quantified in terms of the impact of these variations in the longshore sediment transport. The methodology is applied to Noordwijk, selected as a representative location of the central Dutch coast. The statistical downscaling methodology is based on a classification procedure of the predictor into similar atmospheric patterns over the wave generation areas, namely the <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Then, the wave data is grouped according to the occurrence of the <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> The predictor is built from the sea level pressure fields (SLP) and the squared SLP gradients, while the predictant wave climate is characterized by significant wave height, wave peak period and mean wave direction of wind sea and swell components, resulting in unimodal or bimodal sea states. The chronology of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> is modeled using an autoregressive logistic model, which incorporates the seasonality, the interannual variability and the persistence observed from the historical data. For each <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> wave parameters are modeled using the categorical distribution for the sea-state type, non-parametric kernel density functions for the central-mass regime and two generalized Pareto distributions for the lower and upper tails of wave height and wave period data. The statistical dependence between wave parameters for each sea state is included using a vine-copula approach, where the bivariate dependence of H_s and T_p is modeled using the AC skew t copula and the remaining relations are considered to be Gaussian. The effect of climate change is studied using SLP predictors from the global circulation model ACCESS 1. 0, under the RCP 8. 5 scenario and period 2070 - 2099. The statistical model is applied to identify changes in the occurrence probability of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the future. The importance of these changes are quantified in terms of the wave-induced longshore sediment transport using the process based model Unibest TC. The longshore sediment transport distribution for each <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> is computed and afterwards the changes in gross and net transports are estimated using the present and future probabilities of the <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> In terms of the <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> the results of this work suggest changes in the occurrence probability of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the future, with variations of ± 60 % with respect to present climate, and no relevant changes in the sequence of <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> neither in terms of the transition probability matrix nor in terms of the persistence of each <b>weather</b> <b>type.</b> In terms of longshore sediment transport, significant changes are detected in the transport associated with some of the <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> For the remaining <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> the changes are in the order of the model uncertainty. Taking into account the contributions from all <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> a net increase of the southward directed net longshore sediment transport with respect to the historical period is detected. This increase is driven by a decrease in northwards transport and a lower decrease in southwards transport. This result is in line with a poleward shift of the North Atlantic storm track reported in other studies. Most importantly, weather-type based climate classification has in this thesis been succesfully proven to be a reliable tool to analyze the wave climate at the location of interest. Furthermore, the statistical downscaling also provides a climate emulator that captures the climate dynamics at different time scales, which can be used for stochastic simulations of the atmospheric and wave climate, either for the recent past or future projections...|$|R

In the second stage, support vector regression (SVR) is used to construct five forecasting models—one for each <b>weather</b> <b>type.</b> In the last stage, a fuzzy inference algorithm is used to select an appropriate forecasting model to achieve more accurate results. The work presented in [13] proposes a hybrid model for one-day ahead hourly PV power forecasting; this work is an extension of [35]. The proposed method comprises three stages: data classification stage, training stage and forecasting updating stage. The classification stage is developed using Fuzzy K-Means clustering algorithm; the objective is to classify the historical PV power data into five <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> according to the verbal weather forecast of the TCWB (Taiwan Center Weather Bureau). In the second stage, RBFNN is used to construct five forecasting models, one for each <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> and a fuzzy inference algorithm is used to select an appropriate forecasting model. In the last stage, the forecasts are updated every 3  h to cope with the possible fluctuation of PV power.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed {{by means of the}} Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north-south gradients in the influence of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and the increase in the frequency of A <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> it is not sufficient to explain the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transportation}} literature {{in general and}} the travel behaviour literature specifically, there is no consensus on the representation of weather in behavioural models, ranging from studies that use direct meteorological measurements, such a continuous variable for inches of rainfall or temperature, to indicator variables (which themselves are often subjectively derived) for qualitative weather assessments. To explore the representation of weather, this paper develops constructs of weather based upon cluster analysis of various daily weather characteristics and test the validity of these weather representations against two dimensions of travel behaviour: mode share and trip generation. Using Sydney, AUS as a case study, ten years of hourly weather data for the region are reduced using a two-stage cluster analysis technique, resulting in 17 meteorologically distinct <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> These <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are then tested for their correlation with one way of data from the Sydney area Household Travel Survey. Initial results comparing mode shares with <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> indicate that the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> can be further reduced into fewer types. The inclusion of these <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> into models of trip generation show improved model performance; however, the results are weak with respect to contributing to a final valid set of weather constructs. More work {{needs to be done to}} explore the representation of weather in travel behaviour models and the overall effect of weather on travel choices...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} solar {{variability}} on weather and climate in central Europe {{is still not}} well understood. In this paper we use a new time series of daily <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> to analyse {{the influence of the}} 11 -year solar cycle on the tropospheric weather of central Europe. We employ a novel, daily <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> classification over the period 1763 – 2009 and investigate the occurrence frequency of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> under low, moderate, and high solar activity level. Results show a tendency towards fewer days with westerly and west-southwesterly flow over central Europe under low solar activity. In parallel, the occurrence of northerly and easterly types increases. For the 1958 – 2009 period, a more detailed view can be gained from reanalysis data. Mean sea level pressure composites under low solar activity also show a reduced zonal flow, with an increase of the mean blocking frequency between Iceland and Scandinavia. <b>Weather</b> <b>types</b> and reanalysis data show that the 11 -year solar cycle influences the late winter atmospheric circulation over central Europe with colder (warmer) conditions under low (high) solar activity...|$|R
40|$|A <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> {{classification}} scheme was implemented {{for the construction}} of a wind atlas to mainland Portugal. This methodology produced 26 different <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> computed by geostrophic vorticity at mean sea level pressure. Applying a simple calculus scheme, it is possible to find the most likely representative day for each <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> if a meteorological database with wind data is available. Each selected day can be simulated by a mesoscale model (e. g.

Empirical models for assessment {{as well as}} for forecast of medical-meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> at the seaside climatic zone in Palanga were developed. It was based on the data of meteofactors (atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, temperature, oxygen density in atmosphere, cyclone fronts, etc.) {{as well as on the}} occurrence of meteotropical reactions of cardiovascular function collected during 8 -year period. The empirical models allow objectively assess and forecast 3 <b>types</b> of medical-meteorological <b>weather</b> types: favourable, unfavourable and very unfavourable weather. Classification model assessed favourable <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> in 56. 1 %, unfavourable in 31. 7 % and very unfavourable in 12. 2 %, while forecast was of favourable <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> in 52. 4 %, unfavourable in 46 % and very unfavourable in 1. 6 % of days. Developed model enables more precise weather estimation and forecast meteotropical reactions promoting development of preventive measures of cardiovascular complications for reduction of negative weather impact on health in coronary artery diseases patients.

We report the relative risk of mortality from all non-accidental, respiratory-, and cardiovascular-related causes, associated with exposure to four air pollutants, by <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and season, in 10 major Canadian cities for 1981 through 1999. We conducted this multi-city time-series study using Poisson generalized linear models stratified by season and each of six distinctive synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Statistically significant relationships of mortality due to short-term exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone were found, with significant modifications of risk by <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> season, and mortality cause.

40|$|Oporto is {{a medium}} size {{city on the}} NW coast of Portugal with {{approximately}} 300 000 inhabitants that has experienced an intense urbanization process especially after 1970. Results from daily field work from November 2003 to January 2005 show several different thermal nocturnal pattern in Paranhos, Oporto, some of which we conclude can easily be related to different <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Our main purpose is to demonstrate the diversity of Oporto’s climatic subsystem resolution processes under generically similar <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> as found during our period of itinerant measurements. Our research underlines {{the idea that the}} latitude, the strength of the winds from west, the Douro’s river presence and the altimetric diversity are not sufficient to erase the influence of urban metabolism on the energy city balance. From the analysis of the various examples selected, it is possible to state that there is a significant relationship between the <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and the magnitude and pattern of the “urban heat islands”. The “urban heat-island” was specially evident on days of strong stability, weak barometric gradient, weak wind and frequent periods of calm, conditions normally associated with the presence of anticyclonic situations, but which we have found also under the influence of cyclonic <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> We conclude however that it is not absolutely true that the “urban heat-island” is weaker under cyclonic than anticyclonic <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> On the majority of the days with cyclonic weather and good mixing conditions we frequently verified a disturbance in the explicatory capacity of the two geographic factors considered - distance from the sea and altitude ( [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonality}} {{and characteristics}} of rainfall in the UK are altering under a changing climate. Summer rainfall is generally decreasing whereas winter rainfall is increasing, particularly in northern and western areas (Maraun et al., 2008) and recent research suggests these rainfall increases are amplified in upland areas (Burt and Ferranti, 2010). Conditional analysis {{has been used to}} investigate these rainfall patterns in Cumbria, an upland area in northwest England. Cumbria was selected {{as an example of a}} topographically diverse mid-latitude region that has a predominately maritime and westerly-defined climate. Moreover it has a dense network of more than 400 rain gauges that have operated for periods between 1900 and present day. Cumbria has experienced unprecedented flooding in the past decade and understanding the spatial and temporal changes in this and other upland regions is important for water resource and ecosystem management. The conditional analysis method examines the spatial and temporal variations in rainfall under different synoptic conditions and in different geographic sub-regions (Ferranti et al., 2009). A daily synoptic typing scheme, the Lamb Weather Catalogue, was applied to classify rainfall into different <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> for example: south-westerly, westerly, easterly or cyclonic. Topographic descriptors developed using GIS were used to classify rain gauges into 6 directionally-dependant geographic sub-regions: coastal, windward-lowland, windward-upland, leeward-upland, leeward-lowland, secondary upland. Combining these classification methods enabled seasonal rainfall climatologies to be produced for specific <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and sub-regions. Winter rainfall climatologies were constructed for all 6 sub-regions for 3 <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> - south-westerly (SW), westerly (W), and cyclonic (C); these <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> contribute more than 50 % of total winter rainfall. The frequency of wet-days (> 0. 3 mm), the total winter rainfall and the average wet day rainfall amount were analysed for each rainfall sub-region and <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> from 1961 - 2007 (Ferranti et al., 2010). The conditional analysis showed total rainfall under SW and W <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> to be increasing, with the greatest increases observed in the upland sub-regions. The increase in total SW rainfall is driven by a greater occurrence of SW rain days, and there has been little change to the average wet-day rainfall amount. The increase in total W rainfall is driven in part by an increase in the frequency of wet-days, but more significantly by an increase in the average wet-day rainfall amount. In contrast, total rainfall under C <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> has decreased. Further analysis will investigate how spring, summer and autumn rainfall climatologies have changed for the different <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and sub-regions. Conditional analysis that combines GIS and synoptic climatology provides greater insights into the processes underlying readily available meteorological data. Dissecting Cumbrian rainfall data under different synoptic and geographic conditions showed the observed changes in winter rainfall are not uniform for the different <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> nor for the different geographic sub-regions. These intricate details are often lost during coarser resolution analysis, and conditional analysis will provide a detailed synopsis of Cumbrian rainfall processes against which Regional Climate Model (RCM) performance can be tested. Conventionally RCMs try to simulate composite rainfall over many different <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and sub-regions and by undertaking conditional validation the model performance for individual processes can be tested. This will help to target improvements in model performance, and ultimately lead to better simulation of rainfall in areas of complex topography...|$|R
40|$|Synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>typing</b> {{depends on}} the method and its implementation. This paper {{demonstrates}} the utility of a 2 -phase batch self-organising map procedure (CP 2) in comparison with a procedure (CP 1) consisting of T-mode principal component analysis followed by convergent K-means clustering, for classifying the synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> over east Australia. Four classifications were obtained for the 52 -year NCEP/NCAR dataset, one from CP 1 and three from CP 2. These classifications were examined in terms of grouping quality, mean type maps, type frequencies, lifetime and transitions, and {{in relation to the}} Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results showed that the classifications derived from different procedures are inter-confirmative and capture a similar set of major synoptic situations influencing east Australia, each having counterparts in previous studies and conforming well to local synoptic experience. In particular, this study demonstrates that CP 2 is a promising tool for the purpose of <b>weather</b> <b>typing</b> with a two-fold utility: CP 2 can perform data projection (neighbourhood width > = 1) and provide a flexible means for visualising the broad distribution of the daily weather patterns in the dataset; and the procedure can also conduct cluster analysis (neighbourhood width = 0) and produce results equ ivalent to those from CP 1. It was found that performing data clustering or data projection may affect the inference associated with type frequencies. While focusing on methodology, the analysis has also shown that the frequency of synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> fluctuates on the seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. From the 1970 s to 1995 there was a decline in the occurrence of a few <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> associated with an east-coast trough extending over New South Wales from the north, and a slight increase in the activity of some anticyclonic types. Significant correlations were also identified between SOI and frequencies of synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> on the annual and seasonal timescales. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{version of}} the Lamb <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> classification scheme was employed to characterize daily circulation conditions in Saudi Arabia from 1960 to 2005. Daily gridded fields of sea level pressure (SLP) from both the NCEP/NCAR and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis data (ERA 40) were used as input data for this classification. The output catalog included 10 basic types, which describe the direction and vorticity of airflow in the region (i. e., cyclonic, anti-cyclonic, and directional). In general, our findings indicate that cyclonic (C) days represent the most frequent type among all days, with 69. 2 % of the annual count of days from 1960 to 2005, followed by SE directional flows (21 %). It was also determined that airflows originating from the Indian Ocean (i. e., S, SE, and E) are more frequent than those from the Mediterranean and Red Seas (i. e., W, NW, and SW). The defined <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> were assessed {{for the presence of}} inter-annual and intra-annual trends using the Mann–Kendall tau statistic. The trend analysis suggests statistically significant changes in the frequencies of a majority of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> from 1960 to 2005. The relationship between the daily occurrence of rainfall and the frequency of individual <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> was also described using daily rainfall data from a network of 87 weather observatories.
