5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E

25|$|Studies of {{a speech}} {{community}} that presuppose the existence of that community may reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> and overlapping identities for individuals. Furthermore, studies of gay male language use often look at middle class European Americans who are out as gay {{to the exclusion of}} other subgroups of the LGBTQ community, and hence may draw misleading conclusions about the community as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Community-based program {{design is}} a social method for {{designing}} programs that enables social service providers, organizers, designers and evaluators to serve specific communities in their own environment. This program design method depends on the participatory approach of community development often associated with community-based social work, and is often employed by community organizations. From this approach, program designers assess the needs and resources existing <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> and, involving community stakeholders in the process, {{attempt to create a}} sustainable and equitable solution to address the community's needs.|$|E

This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place in a community of interested readers.|$|E
25|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2010 -11 were {{set by the}} school board at 24.0700 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's {{assessed}} value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account {{for the vast majority}} (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{entities}} {{in possession}} of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally {{for as long as}} that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded information should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient’s death to investigate illnesses <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case).|$|E

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|From early colonial days, {{when some}} English and German {{settlers}} came {{in search of}} religious freedom, America has been profoundly influenced by religion. That influence continues in American culture, social life, and politics. Several of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of like-minded people: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans (Congregationalists), Pennsylvania by British Quakers, Maryland by English Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Despite these, {{and as a result}} of intervening religious strife and preference in England the Plantation Act 1740 would set official policy for new immigrants coming to British America until the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Microbiology {{is a broad}} {{scientific}} discipline pertaining {{to the study of}} that life which is best viewed under a microscope. It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. Microbial ecology is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community,</b> as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment. Both rely on techniques such as sample collection from diverse environments, metagenomics, DNA sequencing, and statistics.|$|E

25|$|By {{identifying}} {{risk factors}} present <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> and creating solutions {{to decrease the}} incidence of injury, trauma referral systems may help to enhance the overall health of a population. Injury prevention strategies are commonly used to prevent injuries in children, who are a high risk population. Injury prevention strategies generally involve educating the general public about specific risk factors and developing strategies to avoid or reduce injuries. Legislation intended to prevent injury typically involves seatbelts, child car-seats, helmets, alcohol control, and increased enforcement of the legislation. Other controllable factors, {{such as the use}} of drugs including alcohol or cocaine, increases the risk of trauma by increasing the likelihood of traffic collisions, violence, and abuse occurring. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines may increase the risk of trauma in elderly people.|$|E
25|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2015-16 were {{set by the}} Blackhawk School Board at 59.1200 mills in Beaver County and 18.5000 mills in Lawrence County.

Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth, as they create a significant disparity in taxation <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> and across a region. Property taxes in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania apply only to real estate – land and buildings – and is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions, and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E
