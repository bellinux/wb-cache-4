500|$|The Molloy {{character}} {{is based on}} actor David Niven's performance as the character A. J. Raffles, a gentleman thief, in the 1939 film Raffles. The music heard {{at the beginning of}} the episode during the burglaries is taken from the film The Pink Panther, in which Niven played The Phantom, a similar character. Flanders tells Homer that his Shroud of Turin beach towels were stolen during one of the burglaries. Apu protects the Kwik-E mart with a rifle in a way similar to many of the images of Korean Grocery store owners during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.] Homer's dream of riding a nuclear bomb into oblivion is a reference to the famous scene from the film [...] Homer's line [...] "So I said, Look buddy, your car was upside-down <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>here.</b> And as for your grandmother, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that!" [...] is a reference to Flannery O'Connor's short story [...] "A Good Man Is Hard to Find". The scene of Homer and Principal Skinner talking in front of the museum is a reference to a scene from the television series Dragnet. In a reference to the plot of the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Molloy sends the residents of Springfield on a hunt for a treasure that is buried under a big letter. The ending sequence of the episode also references the film by using the same music and camera angles. In another scene that references It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Bart tricks American actor Phil Silvers into driving his car into a river, just like Silvers's character did in the film.|$|E

Gee it was swell. I’ve read it about eight times already. I miss you SO much darling, and it’s only been about four hours since I last saw you. I[t] seemed funny to put you on a train for a change. Say what’s this about you losing your job? I guess since you didn’t say anything about it this weekend it’s O. K. now, n’est ce pas? Honey, try to wear your hair up next weekend, please. Then we can go to New York and be glamorous. I’ll bet you look nice when you get up in the morning. I’m serious now, no kidding. Remember this morning around six o’clock? You didn’t have any makeup on and you were very groggy and sleepy, and you had just brushed your hair—You looked wonderful. You know darling, you’re very pretty. This was a nice weekend. I {{thought it was going to}} be a stinker about ten Saturday night. I was in an awful mood, honey. Whenever you see I’m in a mood like that darling, just turn your head so I can see your eyes, or smile in the wonderful way that you do, or, oh I could name a thousand other things about you that are a sure cure, things that I love, the small things that add so much to my love toward you. You know, hon, we seem to have the same moods together. That’s good. You’re just perfect, honey, too perfect to be true. But—who was it that you kissed goodnight on the first night you went out with him? Huh? We did do a lot of talking this weekend didn’t we, or at least I did. Maybe I said too much, but I believe in being frank, and not keeping anything from each other, and I know you do. I’d much rather have me tell you now about my—er—should I say escapades, than someone else later. God, I wish this war was over too, darling, I think it will take at least two years to finish this job. It’s going to be a long, tough, filthy fight, angel, but it will be worth it, for we’re fighting for freedom, this wonderful country, for people like you and your family, and our happiness. Darling, it will be worth it. And honey, you’re helping the war effort, not only by buying bonds as you do, but by the seemingly unimportant things that you do like sending packages overseas, or writing to fellas over there. Keep it up honey, and that will be your contribution, one of the best. Oh, and by the way, you do a lot to keep up the morale of one certain very important member of our Air Corps, and I don’t mean “Hap” Arnold, (or do you write to him too). By the way, I love you. And remind me to remind you to tell me how wonderful I am. Well hon, I kinda fell [sic] like it’s going to snow tomorrow, so I guess we’ll have good weather and fly all day. I’ll be thinking of you always (I like that word, now.) That would be a good song for us honey. Do you like “always”? It would be very appropriate ‘cause I know “I’ll be loving you,—always” my darling. Give my love to your mother. Did I say goodby [sic] to her today. I can’t remember.

When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old woman's leather; (ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK) i hadn't no more than got it off when i wished i hadn't done it, for awhile before that {{i made up my mind}} to be a square bloke, for months on your word, but forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip (EASY TO GET)--but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything. & she tumbled (DISCOVERED) her leather was off (GONE)--is this it says i, giving it to her--well if you aint honest, says she, but i hadn't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a hurry. <b>When</b> <b>i</b> <b>got</b> <b>here</b> i had $1 and 25 cents left & i didn't get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote (FOR A DECK HAND)--The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for moons (LARGE, ROUND SEA-BISCUIT) & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe (PICKING POCKETS) again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once anyhow, but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get off wos, Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake, amen; & i kept a thinking, of it over and over as i went along--about an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done writing. As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it, & I grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street, & when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive--the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little & I grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped--the gentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook hands with me and gave me a $50 green back, & my asking the Lord to help me come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i couldn't drop the reigns nor say nothing--he saw something was up, & coming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my head just then to ask him for work; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job--says he, jump in here & lets talk about it, but keep the money--he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes, for i used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive horses, he told me he wanted a man for that work, & would give me $16 a month & bord me. You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my little room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square it, & to bless you for putting me up to it, & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs (CLOTHES) & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and morning, & ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown (that's his name) came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible--he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no--he asked me how it was i read the bible instead of papers & books--Well Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in prison & about you, & how i had almost done give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when I asked him; & the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it, & i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months--he talked to me like a father for a long time, & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i didn't fear no one giving me a back cap (EXPOSING HIS PAST LIFE) & running me off the job--the next morning he called me into the library & gave me another square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would help me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling book, a Geography & a writing book, & he hers me every nite--he lets me come into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to understand my bible better.|$|E
