40|$|Abstract. For given sets A, B, and Z {{of natural}} numbers where {{the members of}} Z are z 0, z 1, [...] . in {{ascending}} order, one says that A <b>is</b> <b>selected</b> from B by Z if A(i) = B(zi) for all i. Furthermore, say that A <b>is</b> <b>selected</b> from B if A <b>is</b> <b>selected</b> from B by some recursively enumerable set, and that A <b>is</b> <b>selected</b> from B in n steps iff there are sets E 0, E 1, [...] ., En such that E 0 = A, En = B, and Ei <b>is</b> <b>selected</b> from Ei+ 1 for each i < n. The following results on selections are obtained in the present paper. A set is ω-r. e. {{if and only if}} it can <b>be</b> <b>selected</b> from a recursive set in finitely many steps if and only if it can <b>be</b> <b>selected</b> from a recursive set in two steps.
