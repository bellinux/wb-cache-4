5|$|Ashurbanipal was {{designed}} by Fred Parhad, an Iraqi-born artist of Assyrian descent. Parhad rejected formal arts studies at the University of California, Berkeley and relocated to New York, where the Metropolitan Museum of Art allowed him to study its Assyrian collection. The work was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts {{under the direction of}} its president, Narsai David. The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation also claims to have commissioned the work. Funds <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> Assyrians throughout the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1942, E.J.H. Corner, the {{assistant}} Director of Gardens in the Straits Settlement, {{with the support}} of Sir Shenton Thomas, met a group of Japanese scientists and nobles with the intention of protecting the invaluable collections of the Library and museum. He was later enlisted by Professor Hidezo Tanakadate to assist in re-establishing the library and museum.

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1860 as Agaricus chlorophos. The original specimens <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the Bonin Islands by American botanist Charles Wright in October 1854 {{as part of}} the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition of 1853–56. Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the species to the genus Mycena in an 1887 publication. Daniel Desjardin and colleagues redescribed the species and set a lectotype specimen in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished {{in the line of}} duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent French {{attempts}} to supply their one remaining colony on Guadeloupe were minor, {{most of the}} brigs sent were seized without reaching the island. The only significant attempt, launched in November 1809, achieved initial success {{in the destruction of}} the British frigate HMS Junon on 13 December, but ultimately failed when the two armed storeships, Loire and Seine were destroyed on 18 December in a battle with a British squadron off the southern coast of Guadeloupe. During the autumn and winter, British forces <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> across the Caribbean at Fort Royal, Martinique, under Cochrane and Beckwith for the invasion of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The species syntypes <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> San Diego Bay, California. The {{specific}} epithet dipterura {{is derived}} from the Latin di ("two"), ptero ("wing"), and ura ("tail"), referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail. Rat-tailed stingray is a former common name for this species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, based on morphology, determined the diamond stingray and the bluntnose stingray (D.say) of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species, that likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma). In addition, the two were found to be the second-most basal taxa in their genus, after the common stingray (D.pastinaca).|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} from Ceylon by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1847; soon after (1852), specimens <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> South Carolina USA. Later, the fungus was described under {{a variety of}} names: Lentinus chrysopeplus from Cuba; Agaricus sabriusculus and Agaricus lacunosa from New York; Collybia lacunosa from Michigan; and Omphalia scabriuscula in Connecticut. As Canadian mycologists Redhead and Ginns explain in a 1980 article on the species, since its original 1847 description, C.asprata has been given 28 names, and placed in 14 different genera.|$|E

5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E
