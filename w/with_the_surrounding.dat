5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E

5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material.

5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E

Rateliff described Strahd as a then-unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities of a player character class; that is, a vampire magic-user. This design enables him to combine his own powers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> environment, making him a difficult opponent to defeat.|$|E

5|$|After the {{suspicious}} {{death of his}} wife Drogo fled England, and the castle was reassigned by William the Conqueror to Odo, the Count of Aumale. In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to bring in valuable revenue to the earls, but would also have helped to defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side. The castle-guard system lapsed, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> estates paying their rents in cash instead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16 or 17, Cadron met a {{travelling}} salesman named Jean-Marie Jetté, possibly while at a family gathering, and married him on October 7, 1811 at the Church of Lavaltrie. Jean-Marie was the brother of Paul Jetté, Cadron's uncle by marriage, {{and at the time}} the two met he was in his thirties. After the wedding, Rosalie Cadron took her husband's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron-Jetté. Jean-Marie moved into Cadron-Jetté's parents' house with her, and undertook a new career as a farmer. In 1811, that house, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> land and outbuildings, was donated to Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie by Cadron-Jetté's parents, on the condition that the parents be allowed to live there until their death, and that Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie assume the care of Cadron-Jetté's sister Sophie until her age of majority.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population.

Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography.
