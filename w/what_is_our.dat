500|$|In {{a meeting}} at Arrowsic, Maine in 1717 Shute and representatives {{of some of the}} Wabanakis {{attempted}} to reach some agreement concerning colonial encroachment on Native lands and the establishment of provincially operated trading posts. [...] The Kennebec sachem (chief) Wiwurna objected not only to the establishment of settlements on their lands, but also the construction of forts, and claimed sovereign control of those lands. [...] Shute, who often rudely interrupted Wiwurna, bluntly reasserted British claims to the territory. [...] The Wabanakis were willing to accede to existing illegal settlements if a proper boundary was delineated beyond which settlement would not be allowed; Shute responded [...] "We desire only <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> own, and that we will have." [...] This ambiguous response, and the treaty that was ultimately agreed, did not satisfy the Wabanakis.|$|E
2500|$|Now the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can {{shape our}} {{military}} establishment to fit <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> policy, {{instead of having}} to try to be ready to meet the enemy's many choices. [...] That permits of a selection of military means instead of a multiplication of means, [...] As a result, it is now possible to get, and share, more basic security at less cost.|$|E

5000|$|Does this {{contract}} adequately describe all essential work / expectations, {{is there a}} schedule and <b>is</b> it enforceable? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> remedies, if any? ...|$|R
2500|$|The Occupy Central with Love and Peace {{movement}} who {{had vowed}} to launched a massive civil obedience occupation {{at the city}} centre of Central, Hong Kong if the constitutional reform proposals did not reach the international standard of free and fair election slammed Beijing's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office. [...] "Genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected," [...] its statement said. [...] "The decision of the NPC Standing Committee has deprived people with different political views {{of the right to}} run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions, thereby perpetuating 'handpicked politics.'" [...] It said it would go on with their Occupy Central plan in the rally where several thousand people turned out opposing Beijing's plan on 31 August night. Occupy Central co-founder Benny Tai told the crowd, [...] "our hope is that people gathered here will be dauntless civil resisters. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> hope? Our hope is that today Hong Kong has entered a new era, an era of civil disobedience, an era of resistance." ...|$|E

6000|$|Do we pride {{ourselves}} on being something? Shall we pride {{ourselves on}} health and strength? A tile falling off the roof, a little powder and lead {{in the hands of}} a careless child, can blast us out of this world in a moment--whither, who can tell? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> cleverness--our strength of mind? A tiny blood vessel bursting on the brain, will make us in one moment paralytic, helpless, babblers, and idiots. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of the world? That of a man, who is forcing his way alone through a thick and pathless wood, where he has never been before, to a place which he has never seen. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> wisdom--What does a wise man say of his? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> amazement when, {{much earlier}} than we expected, we saw Mr. Fordyce driving up in his phaeton, and heard the story he had to tell.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where's the half-and-half? Fanny, {{go over to}} the 'Keys' and get the beer. Here's sixpence.' And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> astonishment when Fanny got up as if to go! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How are we to-day,' said Mr Pecksniff, jocosely, 'and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> plans? Are {{we ready}} {{to go and see}} Tom Pinch's sister? Ha, ha, ha! Poor Thomas Pinch!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove,' he thought, 'the plot thickens. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> only Plunkett {{doing out}} of the House when the door is locked, I wonder.' ...|$|E
60|$|B. B. Ah yes. Precisely. Thank you. Dubedat, of course. Well, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> friend Dubedat? A {{vicious and}} ignorant {{young man with}} a talent for drawing.|$|E

6000|$|... 5. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>our</b> first {{plays in}} the modern sense? What {{influence}} did the classics exert on the English drama? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> meant by the dramatic unities? In what important respect did the English differ from the classic drama? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mogul, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> great forefathers about? Still pulling {{to pieces}} that sublime fabric of a constitution, which has so {{long been the}} wonder of the world, and my especial admiration?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have stayed}} long enough," [...] said the Elves at length, [...] "we have {{many things to}} show you. Come now and see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> dearest work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “God sends wrinkles, but <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> face?” she digressed {{in a tone}} {{of great}} humility. “We shall have glorious faces in Paradise. But {{meantime}} God has permitted me to preserve a smooth heart.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There may <b>be</b> {{truth in}} <b>what</b> you say," [...] said the Templar, darkly smiling. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>our</b> hopes should the allies {{withdraw}} their forces, and leave Palestine in {{the grasp of}} Saladin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{these are}} foolish {{things to all}} the wise, [...] And I love wisdom more than she loves me; [...] My {{tendency}} is to philosophise [...] On most things, from a tyrant to a tree; [...] But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies. [...] <b>What</b> <b>are</b> we? and whence came we? <b>what</b> shall <b>be</b> [...] <b>Our</b> ultimate existence? <b>what</b> <b>'s</b> <b>our</b> present? [...] Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Supper will {{be served}} at six. I have only just {{returned}} from the country, and have heard no news. I suppose that no intimation has been received as to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> destination and whither we shall march?" ...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{frequent}} questions that the public and decision makers ask climate scientists are: What {{do we know about}} past climate? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> uncertainties? <b>What</b> do we know about the causes of climate variations and change? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> uncertainties on causes? The scientific methods of climate re-analysis (henceforth, reanalysis) and attribution play important roles in helping to address such questions. This Chapter is intended to provide readers with an initial foundation for understanding the nature and scientific roles of reanalysis and attribution, as well as their potential relevance for applications and decision making. These subjects are then discussed in detail in the following chapters...|$|R
