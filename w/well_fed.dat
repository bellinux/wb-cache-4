However, Schindler, {{with a combination of}} diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E
5|$|Rose Levin was {{a capable}} cook, and, though the {{household}} {{was not well}} off, Levin was <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> and acquired an interest in food that in adult life {{became one of the}} regular themes of his journalism. The cuisine was traditional Jewish, with fried fish as one cornerstone of the repertoire, and chicken as another – boiled, roast, or in soup with lokshen (noodles), kreplach or kneidlach. As an adult Levin retained his love of Jewish cookery along with his passion for French haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> or producing eggs.|$|E
50|$|The name Las Vegas {{was given}} to the area in 1829 {{by a member of the}} Antonio Armijo trading party that was {{traveling}} to Los Angeles, and stopped for water there on the Old Spanish Trail from New Mexico. At that time, several parts of the valley contained artesian wells surrounded by extensive green areas; Las Vegas means the meadows in Spanish. The flows from the <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> the Las Vegas Wash, which runs to the Colorado River.|$|R

5|$|The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200,000 {{individuals}} {{and during the}} spring and fall, they {{take part in the}} longest elk migration in the continental U.S. Elk in the southern regions of Yellowstone National Park and in the surrounding National Forests migrate south towards the town of Jackson, Wyoming, where they winter for up to six months on the National Elk Refuge. Conservationists there ensure the herd is <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> during the harsh winters. Many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in Montana, mainly to the north and west.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when <b>well</b> <b>fed.</b> Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

5|$|The oldest part of {{the temple}} was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a {{location}} for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> by the ancient lake, and a temple {{was built on the}} filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were <b>well</b> <b>fed.</b> The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

Water for grazing was sourced from <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> by “natural springs.” Wells were established at Pondalowie Bay and Browns Beach during the 1850s and allowed “the establishment of sheep stations at Cape Spencer, Carribie and Stone Hut in the 1860s.” Cropping was carried out within the locality with “poor yields due to the intense coastal environment and soil infertility.” After 1927, land under cultivation increased due to “a better understanding of the importance of trace elements (mainly manganese).” ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{landmarks}} in the town, the most famous of which is the 12th-century St. Mary's church in the town centre, renowned for its crooked spire, the combined result of the warping of its oak timbers, and damp-induced rot where the timber spire sits on the masonry tower. Across the road from the churchyard is The <b>Wells,</b> <b>fed</b> from a local spring and for centuries serving as a public water supply. In 2010, for reasons as yet unexplained, the inflow to The Wells ceased for a while, and has only been intermittent since then. To the west of the church is the recently refurbished Market Hall, which now houses a number of facilities including the Tourist Information Centre.|$|R

Another large green area precedes the entrance to the main house and to the east side are the former stables. Farther east is large bricked terrace with French-mosaic tiles, a pool and fountain. The pool is fed by water from three <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> by a cenote located under the terrace. The edge of the pool is stone. There also is a cistern with stone stairs.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of surface water dictates {{human and animal}} activity in arid zones. Although typically small, hidden, and inaccessible, springs and <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> by local aquifers were the only sources of reliable water across vast areas of inland Australia until the last century. Compared to larger, more accessible water sources such as riverine waterholes and Great Artesian Basin discharge springs, their history is sketchy and poorly documented, although rich in intrigue and mythology. Since the expansion of artificial waters and motorised transport, many of these small oases have become forgotten, and their location and permanence are now less well-known than for thousands of years. We examine the distribution, hydrogeology, cultural history, and biological values of Tertiary sandstone springs in western Queensland based on a review of historical literature, interviews with long-term residents, and extensive field surveys.

50|$|Ras el Ain, (راس العين) (Lit. Fountain-head; The {{head of the}} Spring), is a place abounding with immense fountains, with {{reservoirs}} and aqueducts 6 km {{south of}} Tyre, and ca. 77 km south of Beirut, in the South Governorate (Liban-Sud), in the municipality of Batouliyat. The place lies in a very green and fertile plain, about one kilometer from the sea coast. It is a popular tourist destination, owing to its artesian <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> by underground springs and collected in stone reservoirs that have been maintained through the ages. It has been {{the main source of}} water for ancient Tyre since Phoenician days. One of the reservoirs fed the arched aqueducts of the Roman period, and which once stretched all the way to Tyre. Remains of these aqueducts, exhibiting strong and excellent masonry, with round arches and a continuous cornice above them, can still be seen today, and a short stretch of the original aqueduct is still used today in Tyre's present-day waterworks.A reference to this place is mentioned in the 3rd century Mosaic of Rehob as Rosh Mayya (Fountain-head).|$|R

25|$|Sidewinders have an {{extraordinarily}} accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females {{of about five}} years.

Thus, energetics apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the harsh}} discipline, gladiators {{represented}} a substantial investment for their lanista and were otherwise <b>well</b> <b>fed</b> and cared for.

Romans considered barley inferior to wheat— a punishment for legionaries replaced their wheat ration with it— {{but it was}} thought to strengthen the body. Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen.

40|$|Iodine is a biophilic element, {{with one}} stable isotope, I- 127, and one {{long-lived}} radioisotope, I- 129. Radioiodine originates {{in the surface}} environment almost entirely from anthropogenic activities such as nuclear fuel reprocessing in Europe and thus provides a unique point source tracer. Very few studies have evaluated the geochemical behavior of I isotopes in the subsurface. In this study, the concentrations of I- 129 and I- 127 were measured in <b>wells</b> <b>fed</b> {{by a series of}} artificial recharge ponds in the Forebay Area of the Orange County ground water basin (California, USA) to evaluate their potential use as hydrological tracers. To substantiate interpretation of I- 129 and I- 127 concentration data, the aquifer system was evaluated using the literature values of aquifer water mass age based on H- 3 /He- 3, Xe and delta(18) O tracer data. The aquifer data demonstrate the nearly conservative behavior of I- 129 with I- 129 /I- 127 ratios likely reflecting variations in source functions as well as climatic conditions, and with inferred particle-water partition coefficients (K-d) of 0. 1 cm(3) g(- 1) or less.
