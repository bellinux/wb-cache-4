5|$|For sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400m relay and {{the indoor}} 400metres), each athlete must run the race within their {{allocated}} lane {{from start to}} finish. If an athlete leaves their lane or steps on the line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, {{the beginning of the}} 800m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.|$|E
5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place to crack the defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest. Their plan was to land their main force on the Beauport shore east of the Saint Charles River, and have it cross the river in the fleet's boats, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> guns. When the landing force was on the heights west of Quebec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and {{the banks of the}} river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Anderitum is {{recorded}} in the Notitia Dignitatum as {{the base of the}} praepositus numeri Abulcorum – an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that they were an elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably {{in the form of a}} single detachment, at Anderitum. They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or perhaps even a single band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were {{recorded in the}} Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> being {{split into two}} groups. In {{the first group of}} twelve runners, Wilson topped the session, 0.46 seconds ahead of the HVM Racing machine of Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro—one of four female drivers in the race—with Alex Tagliani in third position. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Power, Takuma Sato and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Hunter-Reay topping his second session of the day. Hélio Castroneves, Briscoe, Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power recorded the fastest lap time, holding off the British pair Wilson and Franchitti. Hunter-Reay, Kanaan and Tagliani finished between fourth and sixth, and would be {{the other half of the}} drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Franchitti saved his best lap of qualifying to the last possible moment, taking his thirteenth career IndyCar Series pole position, and his 24th in American open-wheel racing. Tagliani took second on the grid, on his début with the FAZZT Race Team. Wilson took third ahead of Hunter-Reay, Power and Kanaan.|$|E
5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} to reset his vehicle and a yellow flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over {{the rest of the field}} and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although he had enough electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop to switch into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive in clean air and undercut the field. The rest of the field followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|E

30|$|The {{processes}} of enhancing CBM recovery by injecting CO 2 <b>with</b> heat include <b>the</b> {{processes of}} gas seepage–adsorption–diffusion–heat transfer in a porous medium. <b>The</b> seepage <b>field,</b> coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> diffusion <b>field</b> through flow velocity and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> adsorption <b>field</b> through source terms, is coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heat transfer <b>field</b> by controlling convection heat transfer. The multiple gas adsorption <b>field,</b> coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> diffusion <b>field</b> through <b>the</b> concentration distribution and <b>the</b> seepage <b>field</b> through <b>the</b> partial pressure, is coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heat transfer <b>field</b> by <b>the</b> {{relationship between the}} adsorption constant and temperature. When <b>the</b> heat transfer <b>field</b> {{is influenced by the}} seepage velocity, the temperature distribution will also affect the permeability distribution, gas density and gas viscosity in <b>the</b> seepage <b>field.</b> Meanwhile, it will also affect the adsorption constant in <b>the</b> adsorption <b>field,</b> {{so that it can be}} coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> multiple gas adsorption <b>field.</b> <b>The</b> porosity and permeability will also be affected by the in situ stress environment.|$|R
