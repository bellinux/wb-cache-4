A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride salt and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by <b>water</b> <b>washing.</b> Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.|$|E

25|$|Like other {{corrosive}} {{acids and}} alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose proteins and lipids in living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently cause chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness upon contact with eyes. Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature {{if there is}} water, such as water vapor. Thus, protective equipment, like rubber gloves, safety clothing and eye protection, should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of <b>water.</b> <b>Washing</b> is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} UDDTs serve {{indigenous}} communities who live along small rivers {{as well as}} ecotourism operations in the Amazonian part of the country. In these regions, piped water supply is often lacking, clay-rich soils do not permit infiltration of wastewater, and the groundwater level is usually high. These factors make other types of toilets {{or other forms of}} excreta management problematic. For example, local governments and ecotourism operations often install flush toilets that drain straight into rivers or into holes in the ground, where the water is intended to drain but cannot, since the soil is mostly impermeable clay. Coupled with the abundant local rainfall, these pits tend to fill very fast and overflow into the nearest streams. The streams get easily contaminated with fecal matter, as they are often quite small and there is not much dilution with clean river water. This leads to health hazards for the communities who use these rivers for drinking <b>water,</b> <b>washing,</b> swimming, and fishing.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} PGR is {{composed}} of one chemical compound normally produced in the leaves of plants, originating from chloroplasts, especially when plants are under stress. In general, it acts as an inhibitory chemical compound that affects bud growth, and seed and bud dormancy. It mediates changes within the apical meristem, causing bud dormancy and the alteration of the last set of leaves into protective bud covers. Since it was found in freshly abscissed leaves, it was thought {{to play a role}} in the processes of natural leaf drop, but further research has disproven this. In plant species from temperate parts of the world, it plays a role in leaf and seed dormancy by inhibiting growth, but, as it is dissipated from seeds or buds, growth begins. In other plants, as ABA levels decrease, growth then commences as gibberellin levels increase. Without ABA, buds and seeds would start to grow during warm periods in winter and be killed when it froze again. Since ABA dissipates slowly from the tissues and its effects take time to be offset by other plant hormones, there is a delay in physiological pathways that provide some protection from premature growth. It accumulates within seeds during fruit maturation, preventing seed germination within the fruit, or seed germination before winter. Abscisic acid's effects are degraded within plant tissues during cold temperatures or by its removal by <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> in out of the tissues, releasing the seeds and buds from dormancy.|$|E

500|$|At this point, both fleets were sailing {{generally}} east, {{away from}} the bay, with winds from the north-northeast. The two lines were approaching at an angle so that the leading ships of the vans of both lines were within range of each other, while the ships at the rear were too far apart to engage. The French had a firing advantage, since the wind conditions meant they could open their lower gun ports, while the British had to leave theirs closed to avoid <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> onto the lower decks. The French fleet, which was in a better state of repair than the British fleet, outnumbered the British {{in the number of}} ships and total guns, and had heavier guns capable of throwing more weight. In the British fleet, [...] and , two ships of the West Indies squadron that were among the most heavily engaged, were in quite poor condition. Graves at this point did not press the potential advantage of the separated French van; as the French centre and rear closed the distance with the British line, they also closed the distance with their own van.

[...] When Arbuthnot spotted the French fleet to his northeast at 6 am on March 16, they were about [...] east-northeast of Cape Henry. [...] Arbuthnot came about, and Destouches ordered his ships to form a line of battle heading west, with the wind. [...] Between 8 and 9 am the winds began shifting, but visibility remained poor, and the two fleets manoeuvred for several hours, each seeking {{the advantage of the}} weather gage. [...] By 1 pm the wind had stabilised from the northeast, and Arbuthnot, with superior seamanship, was coming up on the rear of the French line as both headed east-southeast, tacking against the wind. [...] Destouches, in order to escape this position, gave orders to wear ship in sequence, and brought his line around in front of the advancing British line. [...] With this manoeuvre he surrendered the weather gage (giving Arbuthnot the advantage in determining the attack), but it also positioned his ships relative to the wind such that he could open his lower gundecks in the heavy seas, which the British could not do without the risk of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> onto the lower decks.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the scale}} of {{concrete}} production throughout the world, there is potential for implementing methodologies that reduce {{the environmental impact of}} concrete processes. One intriguing solution is utilizing concrete <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> as mixing <b>water.</b> Concrete <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> is the water created by concrete production. If <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> can be reused, this would provide a safe disposal of the water and save millions of gallons of potable water per year (Indiana, 2014). For this to become a realistic option for concrete plants, {{it is important that the}} <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> does not decrease the compressive strength of concrete, otherwise the cost of additional cementitious materials to offset the compressive strength decrease will outweigh any financial benefit of recycling the <b>wash</b> <b>water.</b> Therefore, the purpose of this research project is to examine the effects of <b>wash</b> <b>water</b> on the compressive strength of concrete.
