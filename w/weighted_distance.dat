50|$|The {{weighted}} {{version of}} the minimum covering circle problem takes as input a set of points in a Euclidean space, each with weights; {{the goal is to}} find a single point that minimizes the maximum <b>weighted</b> <b>distance</b> to any point. The original minimum covering circle problem can be recovered by setting all weights to the same number. As with the unweighted problem, the weighted problem may be solved in linear time in any space of bounded dimension, using approaches closely related to bounded dimension linear programming algorithms, although slower algorithms are again frequent in the literature.|$|E

40|$|Nearest {{neighbor}} (NN) classification assumes locally constant class conditional probabilities, and {{suffers from}} bias in high dimensions {{with a small}} sample set. In this paper, we propose a novel cam <b>weighted</b> <b>distance</b> to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality. Different from the existing neighborhood-based methods which only analyze a small space emanating from the query sample, the proposed nearest neighbor classification using the cam <b>weighted</b> <b>distance</b> (CamNN) optimizes the distance measure based on the analysis of inter-prototype relationship. Our motivation comes from the observation that the prototypes are not isolated. Prototypes with different surroundings should have different effects in the classification. The proposed cam <b>weighted</b> <b>distance</b> is orientation and scale adaptive {{to take advantage of}} the relevant information of inter-prototype relationship, so that a better classification performance can be achieved.
