Lower areas in the Bottoms are sprinkled with wetlands that are populated by myriad aquatic species including turtles, frogs and beaver. <b>Water</b> <b>fowl</b> and wading birds are common throughout the marsh as well as along much of the Kishwaukee River itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{sheltered}} coastal bays of Marlborough {{supported a}} small Māori population possibly {{as early as}} the 12th century. Archaeological evidence dates Polynesian human remains uncovered at Wairau Bar to the 13th century. The rich sea and bird life of the area would easily have supported such small communities. As the Māori population of the area increased, they developed the land to sustain the growing population. In the early 1700s canals and waterways were dug among the natural river courses, allowing for the first forms of farming in the area including that of fish and native <b>water</b> <b>fowl.</b> A total of approximately 18km of channels are known to have been excavated before the arrival of European settlers. Māori in the Marlborough Region also cultivated crops, including kumara (sweet potato).|$|E

50|$|Evidence for {{adaptation}} is best investigated {{among the}} Andean birds. The <b>water</b> <b>fowls</b> and cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera) {{are found to}} have undergone significant molecular modifications. It is now known that the α-haemoglobin subunit gene is highly structured between elevations among cinnamon teal populations, which involves almost entirely a single non-synonymous amino acid substitution at position 9 of the protein, with asparagine present almost exclusively within the low-elevation species, and serine in the high-elevation species. This implies important functional consequences for oxygen affinity. In addition, there is strong divergence in body size in the Andes and adjacent lowlands. These changes have shaped distinct morphological and genetic divergence within South American cinnamon teal populations.|$|R
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} dates {{the earliest}} habitation of Native Americans in Utah to about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Paleolithic people lived near the Great Basin's swamps and marshes, which had {{an abundance of}} fish, birds, and small game animals. Big game, including bison, mammoths and ground sloths, also were attracted to these water sources. Over the centuries, the mega-fauna d, this population {{was replaced by the}} Desert Archaic people, who sheltered in caves near the Great Salt Lake. Relying more on gathering than the previous Utah residents, their diet was mainly composed of cattails and other salt tolerant plants such as pickleweed, burro weed and sedge. Red meat appears to have been more of a luxury, although these people used nets and the atlatl to hunt <b>water</b> <b>fowl,</b> ducks, small animals and antelope. Artifacts include nets woven with plant fibers and rabbit skin, woven sandals, gaming sticks, and animal figures made from split-twigs. About 3,500 years ago, lake levels rose and the population of Desert Archaic people appears to have dramatically decreased. The Great Basin may have been almost unoccupied for 1,000 years.|$|E

In a wetland, multiple of habitats are available in a small area which attracts different species of <b>water</b> <b>fowls.</b> A preliminary survey of wetland birds were conducted in March 2017. Six selected wetlands were surveyed in Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, India. Species diversity and total number of birds were calculated. Totally 2, 675 birds belonging to 132 species and 26 families under 15 orders were recorded. Of the total wetland birds recorded, 86 % were least concern and 10 % were near threatened species, 2 % not recognized species and 2 % vulnerable species were recorded. The study also revealed that the wetland harbors plenty of resident as well as few migratory birds. Hence this study was taken up to assess the status of wetlands and this site could be protected for these birds...|$|R

There are areas with high prevalence of mango (Mangifera indica), mahua (Madhuca longifolia), sal (Shorea robusta), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) trees. Some of the wild animals of the district are the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), antelok (Anelok cervicapra), pig (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Conis aureus), fox (Vulpes bengalensis), hare (Lepus ruficandatus), monkey (Macaca mulatta), wild cat (Felis bengalensis) and the porcupine (Hystric leucura). Several species of game birds are also seen, including the peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the black partridge (Frencolinus francolinus) and the gray partridge (Francalinus pondicervanus). A number of migratory <b>water</b> <b>fowls</b> visit the <b>water</b> bodies of the district in winter, such as the goose (Anser anser), common teal (Anas crecca), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), white-eyed pochard (Aythya rufa) and the wigeon (Mareca penelope).

500|$|Alligator gar are {{relatively}} passive, seemingly sluggish solitary fish, but voracious ambush predators. [...] They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily piscivores, {{but they will}} also ambush and eat <b>water</b> <b>fowl</b> and small mammals that may be floating on the surface. [...] Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface, and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach. [...] They lunge forward, and with a sweeping motion grab their prey, impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth.|$|E
500|$|The body of an {{alligator}} gar is torpedo shaped, usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. Their scales {{are not like}} the scales of other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales which are bone-like, diamond-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of {{an alligator}} gar has a dual row of large sharp teeth which are used to impale and hold prey. [...] Alligator gar are stalking, ambush predators, primarily piscivores, but they will also ambush and eat <b>water</b> <b>fowl</b> and small mammals they find floating on the water's surface.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{discovery}} of novel viruses using {{next generation sequencing}} (NGS) technologies including DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq, has greatly expanded our understanding of viral diversity in recent years. The timely identification of novel viruses using NGS technologies is also {{important for us to}} control emerging infectious diseases caused by novel viruses. In this study, we identified a novel duck coronavirus (CoV), distinct with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using RNA-Seq. The novel duck-specific CoV was a potential novel species within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as indicated by sequences of three regions in the viral 1 b gene. We also performed a survey of CoVs in domestic fowls in China using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), targeting the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene. A total of 102 CoV positives were identified through the survey. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral N sequences suggested that CoVs in domestic fowls have diverged into several region-specific or host-specific clades or subclades in the world, and IBVs can infect ducks, geese and pigeons, although they mainly circulate in chickens. Moreover, this study provided novel data supporting the notion that some host-specific CoVs other than IBVs circulate in ducks, geese and pigeons, and indicated that the novel duck-specific CoV identified through RNA-Seq in this study is genetically closer to some CoVs circulating in wild <b>water</b> <b>fowls.</b> Taken together, this study shed new insight into the diversity, distribution, evolution and control of avian CoVs...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} Pasteurella multocida causes fowl cholera, {{a highly}} contagious and severe disease in chicken and <b>water</b> <b>fowls.</b> The disease {{is not well}} described in less intensive production systems, including scavenging family poultry production in developing countries. P. multocida was isolated from 25. 9 % of healthy looking ducks and 6. 2 % of chickens from free range family poultry farms and at slaughter slabs at marked. On experimental infection with 1. 2 – 2. 0 x 108 organisms of the P. multocida type strain (NCTC 10322 T), 12 week-old chickens expressed fowl cholera clinical signs significantly more times (372) than those of 4, 8 and 16 week chicken (173, 272, 187) and more signs were severe. In family ducks the 8 week-old birds expressed clinical signs significantly more times (188) than those of other age groups (117, 80, and 83) and severe signs were more frequent. P. multocida transmitted from seeder birds (n= 12) to sentinel birds (n= 30), which developed clinical signs, {{and in some cases}} lesions of fowl cholera and allowed bacterial re-isolation, whether infected ducks served as seeder for chicken or chicken served as seeder for ducks. This study has documented the occurrence of P. multocida among healthy-appearing family poultry in tropical setting, and demonstrated that age susceptibility is highest in 12 week old family chicken and 8 week old family ducks when challenged with a low virulent strain of P. multocida. It has further demonstrated that cross transmission of fowl cholera may happen between family ducks and chickens and vice versa...|$|R
