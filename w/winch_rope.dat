40|$|With the {{increase}} of importance of bioenergy, the whole tree harvesting system was reconsidered. As a simple way of a whole tree harvesting system, this study analyzed two winching procedures in terms of productivity and influence from terrain conditions. One of the winching procedures was observed on flat terrain, where the felled trees were scattered and then, one-by-one, attached to the <b>winch</b> <b>rope.</b> The other was observed on a steep terrain, where the felled trees were concentrated in a line and then attached, at one time, to the <b>winch</b> <b>rope.</b> A significant difference caused by slope conditions appeared only in the reeling velocity. When increasing the harvested volume in a cycle, the productivity increased. The difference in productivity between two sites was slight with the same harvested volume. By the one-by-one procedure, the full volume harvested in a cycle was only skidded from the nearest felling points, while the bundled procedure skidded the full volume from various points including the farthest point. The one-by-one procedure will save the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> tension and reduce engine acceleration. Fuel consumption, therefore, will be decreased by applying the one-by-one procedure instead of the bundled procedure. Additionally, reducing the weight of felled trees by natural drying in a forest is effective for reducing fuel consumption not only in transportation but also in winching operation, and for enhancing the calorific value of bioenergy...|$|E

40|$|For {{achieving}} a high-quality and efficient management of forest ecosystems (Pentek et al. 2010), {{it is necessary}} to provide an optimally distributed network of primary and secondary forest road infrastructure. The openness of forest areas, the need to describe the existing situation and the tendency to rationalize the existing road network were described with traditional openness (density of forest roads). Traditional openness is a well-known parameter that has represented the size of the basis determined by the level of the achieved existing primary and secondary road density {{for a long time in}} forestry. In many previous researches, different authors described the current state with traditional openness of the secondary forest road network (Rebula 1983, Zdjelar 1990). Traditional openness is a numeric data that says little about the quality of road distribution on the observed areas. It represents only the quantity and distribution of primary and secondary forest roads. The transitional form of themodern view of the subject matter is a combination of traditional openness andmean skidding distance (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007). Relative openness has, lately, (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007) been increasingly used as a variable that describes more precisely and accurately the actual state of forest road infrastructure and defines the need for further opening of forests. The basic terrain characteristics (Šikić et al. 1989) such as relief altitudes, slopes and indented terrains determine the terrain configuration such as: the plain, hilly and mountainous terrains. Generally, relief and terrain can also be divided into plain and bumps, where the plains are – lowlands and plateaus, and bumps are – elevations (hills, highlands, mountains) and troughs (valleys, basins, river basins). The relative openness is both a quantitative and qualitative parameter (Pentek 2010), which gives a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, and expresses the ratio of surface forest area opened by forest roads and the total forest area in percentage terms. It is the parameter that (Pentek 2002), with a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, gives the possibility of establishing open and unopened areas, and offers to designers the option of choosing the most appropriate version of forest road routes. The relative openness is determined by the buffer method and the procedure consists in laying down the buffered areas around the forest road infrastructure. Primary and secondary relative openness can be distinguished depending on the category of forest roads. The secondary relative openness provides information on quantity and spatial distribution of secondary forest road network. The procedure of determining the secondary relative openness is very similar to the process of determining the primary relative openness, but for the calculation of the buffer zone width around skid roads, skid trailsor cable-yarder lines, the mean skidding distance is not taken into account. Depending on applied timber harvesting technologies, the following parameters can be used:• <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length,• forwarder cranes,• length of the cable yarder rope for sideward skidding. The primary forest road infrastructure is taken into consideration when calculating the secondary relative openness because the components of the primary forest road infrastructure can be used in winching roundwood. The importance of the quality of spatial distribution of secondary forest roads (skid roads and skid trails) is determined by the fact that with the same density of secondary roads, if their distribution is bad, the distance of timber extraction is twice bigger than when their distribution is carefully defined (Knežević 1980, Rebula 1981, Rebula 1983). The secondary forest opening depends on the relief area in which the procedure of fine opening is carried out, as well as on the applied (possible) timber harvesting technologies. On flat terrains, which allow skid road and skid trail routes to be laid out perpendicular to the contour lines, forest areas are opened in the shape of a rectangle network, i. e. components of secondary forest road network are separated from the primary components at right angle, and the components of lower order are also separated from those of higher order at right angle, within the network of secondary forest roads. Laying out the network of secondary forest roads in the plain area is not a major problem due to the fact that tractors can move in all directions, which makes the performance of the procedure very simple; no excavating is required, but only removing the stumps of cut trees. Here the system of secondary forest roads is represented through skid trails, which are in fact the defined timber extraction routes – the so called – parallel pattern. On subhilly and hilly terrains with developed hydrographic network and indented relief interlaced with coves and ditches, skid roads and skid trails, adapting to and following the terrain configuration, crawl along the waterways and bays, and at final parts of the watercourses they can be branched in fan-shaped pattern, in the so-called plumose pattern and fishbone pattern. In mountainous areas with large slope, skid roads and skid trails are developed on the slopes following them in an appropriate, allowable, positive longitudinal upward inclination – fishbone pattern. In karst terrain with abundant karst phenomena, particularly sinkholes, the routes of skid roads should be laid out on passes between sinkholes, and in other parts of the forest area they must be adapted to the relief configuration. Laying out skid roads in sinkholes is not justified because of uphill timber skidding, especially from deep sinkholes with steep slopes – irregular pattern. The research area was the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar«, Forest Office Perušić, Forest Administration Gospić. It is an integral part of North Velebitmassif, extending in the east to west direction. Due to its location and altitude, it is considered a high mountain area. The total area of forest management units amounts to 2, 413. 14 ha. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are the steep mountainous terrain and indented, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 20 – 40 °. These features suggest the need for good primary and secondary forest openness. The annual allowable cut (26. 36 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness of the completeManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar« is 9. 97 m per ha, while the openness of secondary forest roads is only 26. 74 m per ha. If only the selected area is taken into consideration, then the primary openness is 27. 13 m per ha, while the secondary openness is 45. 19 m per ha. Researches were carried out in the selection forests of the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume«, Forest Office Opatija, Forest Administration Buzet. The total area of management units is 1, 950. 87 ha. TheManagement Unit »Veprinačke šume« is part of the mountain Ćićarija. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are steep and indented mountainous terrain, rich with karst phenomena, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 5 – 30 °. Based on these features, the need for an effective primary and secondary openness is obvious. The annual allowable cut (41. 59 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness is 8. 58 m/ha, or 16. 78 m/ha, if the old Italian public road with a superstructure made of crushed gravel is taken into account. The secondary openness is 101. 94 m/ha. The objectives of this study were defined through the following phases of work:• establishment of the secondary forest road cadastre,• analysis of the secondary relative openness for the selected skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length,• designing (development) of the secondary forest road network. In the selected subcompartments of the ManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar«, 123 skid roads were investigated of a total length of 46, 656 m. The research area covers 942. 10 hectares and the secondary openness with skid roads is 49. 52 m per ha. In the analysis of the secondary relative openness, the value of access to an area of 45 m was chosen based on the skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length. Due to the terrain slope and surface barriers, the selected <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length was corrected by 10 % because of the increased directional felling. The analysis of conditions in the selected subcompartments of the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar« showed a lack of the secondary relative openness. In order to achieve excellent secondary relative openness, a fine opening of further research areas was done for the selected <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length. When improving (upgrading) the existing network of secondary forest roads, the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length of less than 45 mwas selected as relevant, with the aim of providing work humanization and adapting to the demanding terrain conditions. For this version, a high number of conceptual routes were designed – 83 new skid roads of a total length of 46, 438. 91 m. The newly designed secondary forest road network reached the secondary relative openness of 90. 47 %, by which excellent openness was achieved. Such secondary relative openness was achieved with a density of only 106. 88 m per ha of skid roads. The terrain of the observed area is mountainous and this is why the whole management unit was not taken into consideration. The rest of the management unit is extremely steep and has a protective character. The mountainous terrain is quite steep, but only slightly indented and rather unchanging, which explains the smaller traditional openness required to achieve excellent secondary relative openness than was the case in the previous studies (Jeličić 1983, Rebula and Zdjelar 1983, 1990). Asignificant contribution to a more efficient network of the secondary forest roads is provided by the application ofmodern technologies andmethods in the planning of secondary forest roads. Surveys conducted in the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume« cover 1, 326. 10 ha of forest area and include 629 skid roads of a total length of 152, 893. 44 m. The reason for such a large number of skid roads lies in the fact that the terrain is mountainous, very indented with a large amount of karst phenomena, and hence a higher number of skid roads is necessary because of large terrain indentation. In the researched area the existing secondary relative openness is very good (according to Pentek 2002), and it amounts to 83. 13 %. Traditional secondary openness is 134. 39 m per ha, and it includes the primary roads: the public roads and forest roads with skidding possibilities. The secondary relative openness was determined for three different skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> lengths: 30, 45 and 60 meters. The chosen <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length was decreased by 10 % because of the terrain slope and surface barriers. The surface barriers, spatial distribution of standing trees in the stand and directed trees felling were also taken into consideration. The corrected values were increased by the average value of timber assortments because it is enough to reach only the top of an individual assortment to increase the total area of reach of a tree. Designing new conceptual routes had to be done to improve the existing secondary road network to an excellent level of the secondary relative openness, which was achieved with 42 new skid roads of a total length of 14, 332 m. The secondary relative openness in this case amounts to 90. 13 %, and the road density is 144. 12 m per ha. In the Republic of Croatia harvesting is done by ground machinery, cable-yarders are very rare, and helicopters and other forms of air transport are not applied. Therefore, good primary and especially secondary forest openness by forest roads is extremely important. Comparing the results with previous studies in similar conditions (Rebula 1983 and Zdjelar 1990), the optimal secondary relative openness was achieved with less total length of secondary forest roads. A similar result was obtained by research of the terrain with similar characteristics in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Jeličić 1983), according to which secondary openness of 100 m per ha was recommended in even-aged forests and up to 200 m per ha in selection forests. In earlier studies (Pentek et al. 2008), in similar terrains, secondary forest road network optimization has been done for a various number of <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> lengths: 30, 40, 50 and 60 meters. Due to terrain conditions, horizontal barriers, existing secondary forest road network and in order to provide work humanization, the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length of 40 m was selected. The current secondary relative openness was 78. 42 %. By designing 23. 03 km of new skid roads, an excellent secondary relative openness of 90 % has been achieved with the traditional secondary openness of 113. 47 m per ha. Comparing the results with previous studies (Pičman and Pentek 2003), taking into account the particularities of individual research areas, results in constantly developing methods for estimating the existing and optimizing future networks of secondary forest roads, thus {{achieving a}}n excellent secondary relative openness with lower density of secondary forest roads. Planning a network of secondary forest roads is significantly determined by the existing secondary forest road infrastructure, which often directs further opening. The analysis of the current situation showed that the forest area is opened by the existing network of secondary roads two or even several times more than necessary, thus reducing the efficiency coefficient of the existing road network. This is the result of unsystematic forest opening in the past. It is therefore very important to use the modern methods of forest opening in the forest areas where the procedure of fine opening has been applied from the start, or where the secondary openness is very bad...|$|E

Due to its location and altitude, it is considered a high mountain area. The total area of forest management units amounts to 2, 413. 14 ha. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are the steep mountainous terrain and indented, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 20 – 40 °. These features suggest the need for good primary and secondary forest openness. The annual allowable cut (26. 36 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness of the completeManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar« is 9. 97 m per ha, while the openness of secondary forest roads is only 26. 74 m per ha. If only the selected area is taken into consideration, then the primary openness is 27. 13 m per ha, while the secondary openness is 45. 19 m per ha. Researches were carried out in the selection forests of the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume«, Forest Office Opatija, Forest Administration Buzet. The total area of management units is 1, 950. 87 ha. TheManagement Unit »Veprinačke šume« is part of the mountain Ćićarija. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are steep and indented mountainous terrain, rich with karst phenomena, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 5 – 30 °. Based on these features, the need for an effective primary and secondary openness is obvious. The annual allowable cut (41. 59 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness is 8. 58 m/ha, or 16. 78 m/ha, if the old Italian public road with a superstructure made of crushed gravel is taken into account. The secondary openness is 101. 94 m/ha. The objectives of this study were defined through the following phases of work: • establishment of the secondary forest road cadastre, • analysis of the secondary relative openness for the selected skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length, • designing (development) of the secondary forest road network. In the selected subcompartments of the ManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar«, 123 skid roads were investigated of a total length of 46, 656 m. The research area covers 942. 10 hectares and the secondary openness with skid roads is 49. 52 m per ha. In the analysis of the secondary relative openness, the value of access to an area of 45 m was chosen based on the skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length. Due to the terrain slope and surface barriers, the selected <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length was corrected by 10 % because of the increased directional felling. The analysis of conditions in the selected subcompartments of the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar« showed a lack of the secondary relative openness. In order to achieve excellent secondary relative openness, a fine opening of further research areas was done for the selected <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length. When improving (upgrading) the existing network of secondary forest roads, the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length of less than 45 mwas selected as relevant, with the aim of providing work humanization and adapting to the demanding terrain conditions. For this version, a high number of conceptual routes were designed – 83 new skid roads of a total length of 46, 438. 91 m. The newly designed secondary forest road network reached the secondary relative openness of 90. 47 %, by which excellent openness was achieved. Such secondary relative openness was achieved with a density of only 106. 88 m per ha of skid roads. The terrain of the observed area is mountainous and this is why the whole management unit was not taken into consideration. The rest of the management unit is extremely steep and has a protective character. The mountainous terrain is quite steep, but only slightly indented and rather unchanging, which explains the smaller traditional openness required to achieve excellent secondary relative openness than was the case in the previous studies (Jeličić 1983, Rebula and Zdjelar 1983, 1990). Asignificant contribution to a more efficient network of the secondary forest roads is provided by the application ofmodern technologies andmethods in the planning of secondary forest roads. Surveys conducted in the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume« cover 1, 326. 10 ha of forest area and include 629 skid roads of a total length of 152, 893. 44 m. The reason for such a large number of skid roads lies in the fact that the terrain is mountainous, very indented with a large amount of karst phenomena, and hence a higher number of skid roads is necessary because of large terrain indentation. In the researched area the existing secondary relative openness is very good (according to Pentek 2002), and it amounts to 83. 13 %. Traditional secondary openness is 134. 39 m per ha, and it includes the primary roads: the public roads and forest roads with skidding possibilities. The secondary relative openness was determined for three different skidder <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> lengths: 30, 45 and 60 meters. The chosen <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length was decreased by 10 % because of the terrain slope and surface barriers. The surface barriers, spatial distribution of standing trees in the stand and directed trees felling were also taken into consideration. The corrected values were increased by the average value of timber assortments because it is enough to reach only the top of an individual assortment to increase the total area of reach of a tree. Designing new conceptual routes had to be done to improve the existing secondary road network to an excellent level of the secondary relative openness, which was achieved with 42 new skid roads of a total length of 14, 332 m. The secondary relative openness in this case amounts to 90. 13 %, and the road density is 144. 12 m per ha. In the Republic of Croatia harvesting is done by ground machinery, cable-yarders are very rare, and helicopters and other forms of air transport are not applied. Therefore, good primary and especially secondary forest openness by forest roads is extremely important. Comparing the results with previous studies in similar conditions (Rebula 1983 and Zdjelar 1990), the optimal secondary relative openness was achieved with less total length of secondary forest roads. A similar result was obtained by research of the terrain with similar characteristics in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Jeličić 1983), according to which secondary openness of 100 m per ha was recommended in even-aged forests and up to 200 m per ha in selection forests. In earlier studies (Pentek et al. 2008), in similar terrains, secondary forest road network optimization has been done for a various number of <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> lengths: 30, 40, 50 and 60 meters. Due to terrain conditions, horizontal barriers, existing secondary forest road network and in order to provide work humanization, the <b>winch</b> <b>rope</b> length of 40 m was selected. The current secondary relative openness was 78. 42 %. By designing 23. 03 km of new skid roads, an excellent secondary relative openness of 90 % has been achieved with the traditional secondary openness of 113. 47 m per ha. Comparing the results with previous studies (Pičman and Pentek 2003), taking into account the particularities of individual research areas, results in constantly developing methods for estimating the existing and optimizing future networks of secondary forest roads, thus {{achieving a}}n excellent secondary relative openness with lower density of secondary forest roads. Planning a network of secondary forest roads is significantly determined by the existing secondary forest road infrastructure, which often directs further opening. The analysis of the current situation showed that the forest area is opened by the existing network of secondary roads two or even several times more than necessary, thus reducing the efficiency coefficient of the existing road network. This is the result of unsystematic forest opening in the past. It is therefore very important to use the modern methods of forest opening in the forest areas where the procedure of fine opening has been applied from the start, or where the secondary openness is very bad...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an indirect method of determining exposure to vibration of skidder driv- ers using the Fleet Manager System. The hand-arm exposure of workers to vibration is expressed as energy equivalent A(8), which {{is determined by}} the procedure clearly described in the international standards ISO 5349 - 1 - 2001 and ISO 2631 - 1 - 1997. A(8) is a value that depends not only on the vibration level in certain operating procedures, but also on the duration of exposure (duration of each skidder working procedure). Research was done on the skidder Ecotrac 120 V equipped with the Fleet Manager System (FMS). The role of the FMS is to measure engine speed and duration of a certain engine speed during the working day. The analysis of the working days was performed in the aim to connect skidder working elements (driving, winching, pulling out of <b>winch</b> <b>rope,</b> etc.) with engine speeds. Vibration on the steering wheel and seat of the skidder Ecotrac 120 V was measured by vibrometer with triaxial accelerometer (Brüel and Kjaer 4447) at different engine rotational speeds. The exposure to vibration of a skidder driver on a daily basis A(8) was calculated using data of the summarized durations at certain skidder engine rotational speeds measured by the FMS and the measured level of vibrations at specific engine rotational speeds...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the position and density of a secondary road network in the group-selection management system. The research was conducted in the economic unit Prosara in the north west of the Republic of Srpska. The network of skid roads in the analyzed sections was recorded using the GPS devices Garmin GPS 60 and Garmin Map 62 st, and the analysis software package used was ESRI ArcInfo 10. 1. Adhering to the general guidelines, the slope of skid roads was analyzed within six predefined intervals: 0 - 12 %, 12 - 16 %, 16 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 % and over 40 %. Relative openness with a secondary road network was determined for a maximum distance between the skid roads of 130 m and it ranged from 82. 62 % to 96. 37 %. Such openness was classified as very good and excellent. Together with all factors related to stand and terrain characteristics, it appears that in all the compartments, the density of the secondary network of skid roads is adequate for the application of a skidder with a winch, without extending above the maximum length of the <b>winch</b> <b>rope.</b> Out of the total length of analyzed skid roads, 24 % is within an appropriate slope interval for a planned conversion to truck roads, whereas 37 % is the maximum slope from the ecological point of view. The average terrain slope for the whole analyzed area is 26. 4 %. Such moderately sloping terrain is suitable for the construction of skid roads with low investment and small environmental impact. Due to their specific configuration, the main skid roads were designed along the ridge, while the secondary and tertiary skid roads most often separated from them at the maximum slope, forming an irregular fish bone shape...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Achieving NASA's Space Exploration Vision {{scientific}} objectives {{will require}} human access into cratered and uneven terrain {{for the purpose}} of sample acquisition to assess geological, and perhaps even biological features and experiments. Operational risk management is critical to safely conduct the anticipated tasks. This strategy, along with associated contingency plans, will be a driver of EVA system requirements. Therefore, a medical contingency EVA scenario was performed with the Haughton-Mars Project/NASA to develop belay and medical evacuation techniques for exploration and rescue respectively. Methods: A rescue system to allow two rescuer astronauts to evacuate one in incapacitated astronaut was evaluated. The systems main components were a hard-bottomed rescue litter, hand-operated <b>winch,</b> <b>rope,</b> ground picket anchors, and a rover-winch attachment adapter. Evaluation was performed on 15 - 25 deg slopes of dirt with embedded rock. The winch was anchored either by adapter to the rover or by pickets hammered into the ground. The litter was pulled over the surface by rope attached to the winch. Results: The rescue system was utilized effectively to extract the injured astronaut up a slope and to a waiting rover for transport to a simulated habitat for advanced medical care, although several challenges to implementation were identified and overcome. Rotational stabilization of the winch was found to be important to get maximize mechanical advantage from the extraction system. Discussion: Further research and testing needs to be performed to be able to fully consider synergies with the other Exploration surface systems, in conducting contingency operations. Structural attachment points on the surface EVA suits may be critical to assist in incapacitated evacuation. Such attach points could be helpful in microgravity incapacitated crewmember transport as well. Wheeled utility carts or wheels that may be attachable to a litter may also aid in extraction and transport. Utilizing parts of the rover (e. g. seats) to deploy as a litter may be considered. Testing in simulated 1 / 6 -g to determine feasibility of winch operation and anchor establishment will further reduce implementation uncertainties...|$|E
