5|$|On 18 November 2010, Tao won Singapore's first {{gold medal}} at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, in the 50metres butterfly. Her time of 26.10seconds <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> best as well as a {{national}} record. She had achieved silver in the 100metres butterfly on 13 November.|$|E
5|$|Another {{one of the}} men {{gave the}} {{surprising}} testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|DeForest Kelley, {{the actor}} who portrayed {{physician}} Leonard McCoy on Star Trek, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> favorite of John Belushi. Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley. Kelley overheard Belushi discussing the Saturday Night Live parody of Star Trek with William Shatner, and mentioned {{to both of them}} that he had not yet seen the sketch. Belushi immediately escorted Kelley to his office on the lot and had him watch it on videotape.|$|E

5|$|His loyalty {{the crown}} {{was such that}} in 1460 the Yorkists proclaimed him {{one of their most}} mortal enemies among the king's supporters. They also claimed that Beaumont, along with the earls of Wiltshire and Shrewsbury, orchestrated the Yorkists' {{attainder}} at the 1459 Coventry parliament, in order to seize the Yorkists' lands. It is likely that they were the public focus of the Yorkists' enmity in a way that Henry VI's queen (to whom he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> adviser), Margaret of Anjou could not be.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 he {{published}} another non-fiction book, Whitby Lore and Legend, having retired to Whitby via South Africa. A Schoolmaster's Apologia: Memories of Eighty Years was {{his collection of}} memoirs, published by Abbey Press, Whitby, in 1948. His time at CRGS is documented in his 1948 collaboration, Some Chapters in the History of the Royal Grammar School Colchester, with the one time Mayor of Colchester, Sir William Gurney Benham, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> friend of Shaw Jeffrey and {{first president of the}} Old Colcestrian Society.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Lord Dunsany, {{the tale}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> {{favorite}} of Lovecraft's and has remained popular since his death. Considered {{one of the}} best short stories of Lovecraft's early period, aspects of The Cats of Ulthar would be referenced again in the author's works The Other Gods and The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. It was first published in the literary journal Tryout in November 1920 and now resides in the public domain.|$|E

5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for those {{individuals}} who served in Vietnam {{for a period of}} at least six months. Although it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter's port and starboard bridge wings since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|E

5|$|After the {{departure}} of Damien Duff to Newcastle United, Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt he had worn for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff. The season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> success for Drogba as he hit 33 goals in all competitions (more than his tally in the previous two seasons combined), including 20 in the Premier League to win the Golden Boot. In doing so, {{he became the first}} Chelsea player since Kerry Dixon in 1984–85 to reach 30 goals in a season, scoring 20 in the Premier League, six in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the votes}} in {{parliament}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of electoral reform.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in their}} history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in {{alliance}} with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> possession of Aleppo's royal family, {{and took a}} large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea that was used for ideological purposes, as {{it was meant to}} echo Gilgamesh's deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen {{in the context of the}} alliance with Qatna. The MarioteQaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.|$|E

5|$|Education <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> {{priority}} of Rutherford's, {{as evidenced by}} his retention {{of the office of}} Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the University of Alberta. In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs. In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing; the prize still exists today as the Rutherford Memorial Medal in English. In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.|$|E
5|$|Illinois v. Hemi Group, LLC, 622 F.3d 754 (7th Cir. 2010), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> {{jurisdiction}} case {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois' ruling finding personal jurisdiction based on Internet transactions. In the initial filing, the state of Illinois sued Hemi Group LLC (Hemi) for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents over the Internet in violation of state law and for failing to report those sales in violation of federal law. Hemi moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction, but the district court found that the Internet transactions provided a basis for Hemi to be sued in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s Muller {{was active}} for his businesses, and {{travelled}} to the Congo Conference in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In {{the same year}} he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the Gold Coast, for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out {{with his father and}} younger brother Abram Muller, about both personal and business matters. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.|$|E

As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan.

5|$|On defense, Clemson {{defensive}} end Da’Quan Bowers led all defenders with 11 total tackles, {{including one for}} loss. Bowers' performance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> best for him and was the second-most in ACC Championship Game history. For Georgia Tech, Mario Edwards was the leading tackler with seven, including two assisted tackles. Tech's Jerrard Tarrant, who had five tackles, the second-most on the team, also had one interception and returned it 50 yards. The interception and return, Tarrant's first of the season, was the longest in ACC Championship Game history. Georgia Tech's other interception was fielded by Dominique Reese, for no return.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally {{had the chance}} to appoint the {{governor}} of his choosing: Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role. Although the post was ceremonial, Oliphant brought energy to the role, and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.|$|E
