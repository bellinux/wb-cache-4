5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E

It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

His parents, who ran a business selling tea cosies, put their son's name down in advance for private schools, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how {{they were going to}} pay the fees, until at the last moment, when he was 13, they made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys for each of their children. These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business with sufficient success to be able to pay the fees for Clarkson to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.|$|E

25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E

In the film Arthur Curry starts off <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that he is half-Atlantian, due to his mother being the princess of Atlantis and promised to someone else; in the present she is the Queen, {{and trying to keep}} Arthur's half-brother Orm under control after Darkseid's attack in Justice League: War cost the King of Atlantis his life. At the time, Arthur has just lost his father and is being watched over by Mera, his mother's loyal right-hand woman. After Black Manta orders an assassination attempt on him, Arthur is brought to the royal armory by Mera; there, he dresses in what would become his costume. Arthur confronts Orm, {{with the help of the}} Justice League, but learns that Orm murdered their mother so he could wage war against the surface world. In the midst of the battle, Arthur learns Black Manta had manipulated Orm and summons a shark to swallow him. Thanks to Cyborg's technology, they are able to play Orm's confession of murder to the troops; Arthur takes his place as king, wanting to bridge the surface and Atlantian worlds in peace. Much to his annoyance, Arthur is given the codename Aquaman by Shazam.|$|E

This was the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, the first being Mat Beck's [...] "Wetwired". [...] Goodwin was inspired to write the episode after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, a series of essays by Oliver Sacks, in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring a man who could recall every detail of his childhood. Goodwin {{came up with the idea}} of having Fox Mulder waking up in a strange place <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how he got there.

500|$|While Chahi had a {{clear idea}} of how to {{implement}} his game engine, he mostly improvised when creating the actual content of the game, allowing the game to develop [...] "layer by layer without knowing where it was going." [...] He planned on creating a science fiction game that was similar to Karateka and Impossible Mission. Because he wanted to create a dramatic, cinematic experience, the game features no HUD or dialog, giving the player only a representation of the surrounding game world during both gameplay elements and the cutscenes progressing the story. However, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of the technical limitations he would face while building out the story, he focused more on creating ambiance, rhythmic pacing, and narrative tension to the game. Chahi resorted to developing his own tool with a new programming language through GFA BASIC coupled with the game's engine in Devpac assembler, to control and animate the game, interpreted in real-time by the game engine, effectively creating his own animation sequencer.|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{traveled}} to Tokyo in 2001 {{to prepare for}} this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers.

500|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Monk makes several discoveries in his ongoing {{search for the}} man who killed his wife. He {{discovered}} that the car bomb was indeed meant for Trudy and was built by a man named Warrick Tennyson (Frank Collison), who was hired by a six-fingered man named Frank Nunn (Courtney Gains). In the sixth-season finale, he finally catches up with Nunn, who claims to be yet another pawn <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why Trudy was killed. This turns out {{to be part of a}} larger plot to have Nunn set up another bombing and then frame Monk for killing him; he is shot before Monk can have him arrested or convince him to surrender the name of his employer in Trudy's murder. Once Monk is cleared in Nunn's death, the police find correspondence from Nunn dating back to the era of Trudy's death. There are no names discovered, but there is a reference to the person responsible, referred to as [...] "The Judge". In the two-part series finale, [...] "Mr. Monk and the End", it is revealed that [...] "The Judge" [...] is Ethan Rickover, an actual courtroom judge portrayed by Craig T. Nelson.|$|E

2500|$|Knowledge of the {{traditional}} Polynesian methods of navigation was widely lost after contact with and colonization by Europeans.

The seeding agents move according to the Flocking mechanism and exchange opinions with Bounded Confidence algorithm. Unwitting agents can be infected by seeding agents and achieve the opinions.

2500|$|The term [...] "Minoan" [...] {{refers to}} the mythical King Minos of Knossos. Its origin is debated, but it is {{commonly}} attributed to archeologist Arthur Evans (1851–1941). Minos was associated in Greek mythology with the labyrinth, which Evans identified with the site at Knossos. However, Karl Hoeck had already used the title Das Minoische Kreta in 1825 for volume two of his Kreta; {{this appears to be}} the first known use of the word [...] "Minoan" [...] to mean [...] "ancient Cretan". Evans probably read Hoeck's book, and continued using the term in his writings and findings: [...] "To this early civilization of Crete as a whole I have proposed—and the suggestion has been generally adopted by the archaeologists of this and other countries—to apply the name 'Minoan'." [...] Evans said that he applied it, not invented it. Hoeck, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that the archaeological Crete had existed, had in mind the Crete of mythology. Although Evans' 1931 claim that the term was [...] "unminted" [...] before he used it was called a [...] "brazen suggestion" [...] by Karadimas and Momigliano, he coined its archaeological meaning.|$|E

For example, Superboy first meets a teenage Hal Jordan (Green Lantern); his Earth-Two counterpart, Clark Kent (Kal-L) as a teen; [...] and Toby Manning (the villain Terra-Man) as a boy in the Old West, [...] all years after his first [...] "adult" [...] meetings with them were published. In a backup feature entitled [...] "Superboy's Secret Diaries'", the new series also explored Clark's first couple years as Superboy.

2500|$|While on her lecture tour in Boise, Idaho, Ogden {{announced}} a revelation directing her {{to establish a}} religious colony dedicated to [...] "the truth". She returned to New Jersey <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of a location for the project, but was convinced it must be in a wilderness area far from city life. Ogden explained that she had received ‘a description and a mental picture of the place and knew it was on virgin soil, far removed from city life,’ {{as well as in}} the ‘intermountain country.’ [...] Through friends she learned of available land in San Juan County, Utah, and after visiting the area she made up her mind. She claimed that the location of their commune matched her vision. A group of 21 disciples, mostly from the Boise area, followed her to Dry Valley in southeastern Utah in September 1933. Intending to start a collective farm, the group first tried to buy some irrigated ranch land on Indian Creek, but they could not pay the asking price. Ogden offered the owner membership in the colony and a guarantee of eternal life, but to no avail. They settled on a tract of barren desert near Church Rockthe site, according to Ogden, of Christ's Second Comingand began to build the Home of Truth.|$|E
