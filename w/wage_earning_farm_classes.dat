The journey via Caldbeck, Penrith, Appleby, Leeds, Sheffield, Chatsworth, Nottingham, Leamington, Oxford and Uxbridge took thirty-three days. During his travels, he visited old acquaintances and made many new ones. He visited steel works at Sheffield and lace manufacturers in Nottingham. As {{a member of a}} rural community, he took a particular interest in agricultural matters and noted in his journal that the highest <b>wages</b> <b>earned</b> by <b>farm</b> labourers was two shillings and eight pence (13p) per day. Upon his arrival in London, he learned of Alderman Mechi's experimental farm at Tiptree Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, and sought to visit it. Mechi’s modern methods, his technique of irrigation using liquid manure, his advanced sowing procedures and the novelty of housing livestock on boards above the ground left a memorable impression. Upon his return, he tried to convince his father to adopt modern scientific solutions. Although his father preferred the traditional methods, he allowed his son to experiment on a farm in his own right. [...] In 1863 Lawson and George Moore of Whitehall, Mealsgate invited Mechi to explain his methods to an invited audience of fifty practical farmers.|$|R

40|$|During {{the course}} of development, wages and labor {{productivity}} are much higher in the nonfarm {{sectors of the economy}} than in agriculture. In this paper, we examine the sources and consequences of wage and productivity gaps in the U. S. from 1800 to 2000. We build a quantitative general equilibrium model that closely matches the two-century long paths of farm and non-farm labor productivity growth, schooling, and fertility in the U. S. The family farm emerges as an important institution that contributes to differences in wages and labor productivity. Income from farm ownership compensates farm workers for the relatively low labor productivity and <b>wages</b> <b>earned</b> in agriculture. <b>Farm</b> ownership, along with the higher cost of raising children off the farm, generated a two-fold gap in labor productivity across the farm and nonfarm sectors in the 19 th century US. Consequently, the reallocation of labor from farming to industry raised the average annual growth rate of output per worker by about half a percentage point over the 19 th century. The paper also draws some lessons from the quantitative analysis of U. S. economic history for currently developing countries.

40|$|Access to {{employment}} plays {{a critical role}} in the recovery and functioning of people with schizophrenia. We have investigated the effectiveness of treatments to enhance employment outcomes for people with schizophrenia and evaluated the potential moderators of these outcomes. A literature search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane Databases, MEDLINE, ProQuest XML, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Grey literature databases, references lists of the retrieved articles and specialized journals in the field were also inspected. Job placement, job tenure and <b>wages</b> <b>earned</b> were tested. Risk ratios were extracted for job placement and standardized mean differences were calculated for job tenure and <b>wages</b> <b>earned.</b> Twenty-five randomized controlled trials published between 1986 and December 2015 were analyzed. Engaging in a vocational intervention increases the likelihood of obtaining a competitive job (risk ratio (RR) = 2. 31, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 85 – 2. 88) and has a positive impact on hours worked in any job (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0. 42, 95 % CI: 0. 16 – 0. 68). There was no evidence of intervention efficacy with regard to <b>wages</b> <b>earned</b> from competitive employment. Participation in rehabilitative vocational treatment is not sufficient to ensure work participation for people with schizophrenia.
