The finite <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out}} of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E
