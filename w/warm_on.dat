500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was <b>warm.</b> <b>On</b> the evening of 15July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as {{he was at the}} Blomfield Road house. Walley {{accompanied}} Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and turned to see her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fishermen}} traded metal {{items for}} beaver robes made of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. They used the robes to keep <b>warm</b> <b>on</b> the long, cold return voyages across the Atlantic. These castor gras in French (or [...] "beaver coat" [...] in English) became prized by European hat makers {{in the second}} half of the 16th century, as they converted the pelts to fur felt. The discovery of the superior felting qualities of beaver fur, along with the rapidly increasing popularity of beaver felt hats in fashion, transformed the incidental trading of fishermen in the sixteenth century into a growing trade in the French and later English territories in the next century.|$|E

2500|$|Hong Kong style waffle, in Hong Kong {{called a}} [...] "grid cake" [...] or [...] "grid biscuits" [...] (格仔餅), is a waffle usually made and sold by street hawkers and eaten <b>warm</b> <b>on</b> the street. It {{is similar to}} a {{traditional}} waffle but larger, round in shape and divided into four quarters. It is usually served as a snack. Butter, peanut butter and sugar are spread {{on one side of the}} cooked waffle, and then it is folded into a semicircle to eat. Eggs, sugar and evaporated milk are used in the waffle recipes, giving them a sweet flavor. They are generally soft and not dense. Traditional Hong Kong style waffles are full of the flavor of yolk. Sometimes different flavors, such as chocolate and honey melon, are used in the recipe and create various colors. Another style of Hong Kong waffle is the eggette or gai daan jai (鷄蛋仔), which have a ball-shaped pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The ideal {{temperature}} for serving a particular wine {{is a matter}} of debate by wine enthusiasts and sommeliers, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally enhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at [...] "cellar temperature" [...] (...) [...] Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees. [...] Red wines are generally perceived best when served chambré ("at room temperature").

2500|$|In {{general the}} Barossa Valley has a {{continental}} climate but its series of transverse valleys and sloping hills does produce {{a wide range}} of mesoclimates. Temperatures vary from very <b>warm</b> <b>on</b> the valley floors to progressively cooler at higher altitudes on the hillsides and further North in the valley. Despite its reputation as a [...] "warm climate region", many of the Barossa Valley's climate figures are not that dissimilar from the relatively cooler Margaret River in Western Australia-though the Barossa Valley does have a wider diurnal temperature range. During the [...] heat summation and mean temperatures during the October to April growing season, the region receives about 1710 heating degree days with mean average temperatures during the crucial ripening month of January being around 70°F (21.4°C). Rainfall during the growing season averages only around 6.3 inches (160mm), with average relative humidity around 39%, which means that viticultural irrigation is often used. The exception is many of the old vine vineyards on the slightly cooler western side of the valley which is often dry-farmed without irrigation.|$|E

30|$|The global surface {{temperature}} {{is predicted to}} increase by 1.0 – 3.7  °C {{by the end of}} this century and the Tibetan Plateau, “the Third Pole of the Earth”, is one of the most sensitive regions to climatic warming (Fu et al. 2015; IPCC 2013). To better understand and predict the effect of such <b>warming</b> <b>on</b> alpine ecosystems, many warming experiments are performed; however, no studies are conducted in agricultural ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau (Zhang et al. 2015). The croplands are experiencing obvious <b>warming</b> <b>on</b> the Tibetan Plateau (Shen et al. 2014) and about 80  % of the population lives in the cropland areas of the Tibet (Yang et al. 1996).
