[...] He assembled a talented frontline in Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Jimmy McIntosh, and Alex Munro; with an emphasis on entertaining football. The Seasiders finished in ninth place and reached the 1948 FA Cup Final. On 23 April 1948, the eve of the final, Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award. Despite taking the lead twice in the match, Blackpool lost out 4–2 to Matt Busby's Manchester United in the final, with Matthews assisting Mortensen for Blackpool's second.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} torture on {{the series was}} {{discussed}} by President Bill Clinton who stated {{that he does not}} feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but [...] "If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and you should be prepared to take the consequences." [...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

500|$|On the {{day before}} the invasion, US President Gerald R. Ford and US Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met with Indonesian {{president}} Suharto and reportedly gave their approval for the invasion. In response to Suharto saying [...] "We want your understanding if it was deemed necessary to take rapid or drastic action [...]" [...] Ford replied, [...] "We will understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem and the intentions you have." [...] Kissinger similarly agreed, though he had fears that the use of U.S.-made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny, talking of their desire to [...] "influence the reaction in America" [...] so that [...] "there would be less chance of people talking in an unauthorised way." [...] The US also hoped the invasion would be swift and not involve protracted resistance. [...] "It is important that <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> succeeds quickly," [...] Kissinger said to Suharto.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

A few days after his death, the {{recorded}} anti-cigarette public service announcement was shown on all the major US television networks and in many other countries. In it, he expressed his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial after discovering how sick he was, and that his death was imminent. He then looked directly into the camera for 30 seconds and said, [...] "Now that I'm gone, I tell you: Don't smoke. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> just don't smoke.

If the rewrite doesn't work, we can use the song on a future Whitney project, maybe her greatest hits album." [...] Rich and Friedman ultimately rewrote the entire lyric except for the title. They then redemoed the song and sent the new version to Davis. Davis, Jackson and everyone involved loved the new version of [...] "Run to You", so the song was finally set for the movie.|$|E

2500|$|Raging Bull {{came about}} when De Niro read the [...] {{on the set}} of The Godfather Part II. Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming {{he had no idea what}} Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp." [...] His overall opinion of sport in general is, [...] "Anything with a ball, no good." [...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E
