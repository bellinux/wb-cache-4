5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions.

For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E

Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> time required to deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz.

Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
