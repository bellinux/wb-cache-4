60|$|No! By little {{children}}, St. John means here {{children in}} age,--of course CHRISTIAN {{children and young}} people, for he was writing only to Christians. He speaks to those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been christened, and brought up, more or less, as christened children should be. But, no doubt, when he says little children, he means also all Christian people, whether they be young or old, whose souls are still young, and weak, and unlearned. All, however old they may be, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been confirmed--I do not merely mean confirmed by the bishop, but confirmed by God's grace,--all those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet come to a full knowledge of their own sins,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet been converted, and turned to God with their whole hearts and wills, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet made their full choice between God and sin,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet fought for themselves the battle which no man or angel can fight for them--I mean the battle between their selfishness and their duty--the battle between their love of pleasure and their fear of sin--the battle, in short, between the devil and his temptations to darkness and shame, and God and His promises of light, and strength, and glory,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been converted to God, to them St. John speaks as little children--people who are not yet strong enough to stand alone, and do their duty on God's side against sin, the world, and the devil.

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage.

Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E

Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding for someone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{devoted his life to}} him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E

30|$|The {{second and}} third pairs of columns are the same {{estimation}} with the sample divided into those farm managers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> utilized risk management tools and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> Respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used price risk management tools {{were more likely to}} purchase the offered margin insurance if they had more years of operator education. In contrast to the group of respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools, however, the margin level for those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used price risk management tools was positive and significant. All else constant, a higher margin offers more profit protection. Respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance as operator education increased and as they were closer to insolvency. Further, California respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance than were Wisconsin respondents (the omitted State category).|$|R

The Doctor becomes overly involved in Craig's life, becoming the star player in Craig's local football club, filling in {{for him at the}} call centre when Craig falls ill, and encouraging Sophie to follow her dream of travelling overseas to help animals. Craig, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet professed his love for Sophie, becomes upset; he accosts the Doctor and demands that he leave, which forces the Doctor to reveal his history and his reason for being in the flat.|$|E
5|$|Since turning {{professional}} in 2000, Cancellara has ridden for four professional teams. He has achieved great {{success in the}} classic monuments; he has won Paris–Roubaix three times, the Milan–San Remo once, and the Tour of Flanders three times.

His success has not been limited to just time trials and classics, as he has won general classification of the Tirreno–Adriatico, Tour de Suisse, and the Tour of Oman. In 2008, he won gold in the individual time trial and silver in the men's road race at the Summer Olympics.

5|$|Trondheim {{is later}} {{attacked}} by a Norwegian pirate whaler named Olafsson, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> aged despite being on the ship {{for the past two}} days. Mulder, Scully, and Trondheim eventually begin to age unnaturally. Scully develops a theory that the Ardent is sailing near a metallic object beneath the ocean, and that it has caused free radicals to rapidly oxidize their bodies and age them. When Mulder notices that the ship's sewage pipe is the only one not corroded through, the agents realize that something from the ocean contaminated the Ardents potable water and led to the aging; Olafsson's men remained unaffected due to their consumption of recycled water from the sewage system. Desperate to survive, Trondheim kills Olafsson after he reveals the secret, and sets out to keep the water for himself.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E

He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of}} the family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|It is {{announced}} {{that there will}} be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy, leaving her to take Homer's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison, releasing the prisoners. Therefore, Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie. He tears up Bart's ticket to prove that he means business. Bart begs to be given another punishment, but Homer refuses. After the film's release, Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> seen it. Two months later, the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough. However, Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick. Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by paying for a ticket, but learns that Homer went to the theater and instructed the employees to not sell tickets to him. Eventually, the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won, to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart is in no doubt headed for a better life.|$|E
