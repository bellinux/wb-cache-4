5|$|The urban {{district}} council {{presided over a}} huge increase in population as the Metropolitan Railway gave rise to many new development opportunities.

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex.

Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior and {{roof of the}} original 1931 building as a Seattle city landmark, having approved a recommendation from the Landmarks Preservation Board.

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory, {{also known}} as Project Y, was a secret {{laboratory}} established by the Manhattan Project and operated by the University of California during World War II. Its mission was to design and build the first atomic bombs. Robert Oppenheimer was its first director, from 1943 to December 1945, when he was succeeded by Norris Bradbury.

The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of Zagori acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of folk medicine.

5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem <b>while</b> <b>preserving</b> their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, <b>while</b> <b>preserving</b> their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
40|$|In image {{acquisition}} process, {{the quality of}} microscopic images will be degraded by electrical noise, quantizing noise, light illumination etc. Hence, image preprocessing is necessary and important to improve the quality. The background noise and pulse noise are two common types of noise existing in microscopic images.

5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center <b>while</b> <b>preserving</b> the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem <b>while</b> <b>preserving</b> their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as Metavid and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid's removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, <b>while</b> <b>preserving</b> its archive of government-produced content. C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert's performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner from YouTube. After concerns by some webloggers, C-SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event. On March 7, 2007 C-SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current, future, and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non-commercial copying, sharing, and posting of C-SPAN video on the Internet, excluding re-syndication of live video streams. The new policy {{did not affect the}} public's right to use the public domain video coverage of the floor proceedings of the U.S. House and Senate.|$|E
