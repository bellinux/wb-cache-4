Especially in children, it is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Intoxication symptoms are observed in the early phase because of a high volume of distribution and a high degree of plasma protein binding. Plasmapheresis is very effective in poisonings with amitriptyline, theophylline, diltiazem, carbamazepine, L-thyroxin, verapamil and heavy metals including mercury.

40|$|Osteoporosis {{that is by}} far {{the most}} common {{metabolic}} bone disease, has been defined as a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. Anabolic therapy with teriparatide, recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH 1 - 34), stimulates bone formation and resorption and improves trabecular and cortical microarchitecture. Teriparatide is indicated for the treatment of men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture, including those who have failed or are intolerant of previous osteoporosis therapy. In conclusion, although teriparatide seems quite effective in the treatment of osteoporosis, it may cause life-threatening hypercalcemia. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored if symptoms of hypercalcemia are present during teriparatide treatment. Sustained hypercalcemia due to teriparatide treatment can not be seen in literature so we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> severe hypercalcemia may develop due to teriperatide...|$|R

Presentation of case: We present an unusual scapular fracture that occurred with a rare mechanism. A 23 -year-old male patient who led an active sports life for 10 years and played ice hockey for the last 5 years. In a competition, he felt a sudden pain in his right scapula after hit the puck. He did not experience any direct trauma to his shoulder and {{there was no evidence of}} any pathological fracture. The fracture was isolated in the scapular body and it was classified as type 4, according to Hardegger classification. The was patient immobilized with a Velpau bandage for three weeks and then treated with physiotherapy for shoulder rehabilitation. Discussion: The fracture mechanism was likely a disharmonius contracture of the agonist and antagonist muscles of the shoulder joint while hitting the puck. Conclusion: Scapular fractures are generally seen along with other injuries, but in this case we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> care has <b>to</b> been taken to diagnose an isolated scapular fracture while assessing shoulder pain...|$|R
