5|$|At age 15, Redding {{left school}} to help financially support his family; {{his father had}} {{contracted}} tuberculosis and was often hospitalized, leaving his mother as the family's primary income earner. He worked as a well digger, as a gasoline station attendant and occasionally as a musician. Pianist Gladys Williams, a locally well-known musician in Macon and another <b>who</b> <b>inspired</b> Redding, often performed at the Hillview Springs Social Club, and Redding sometimes played piano with her band there. Williams hosted Sunday talent shows, which Redding attended with two friends, singers Little Willie Jones and Eddie Ross.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and <b>who</b> <b>inspired</b> him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin was {{foremost}} a painter; {{he came to}} ceramics around 1886, when he {{was taught}} by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond <b>who,</b> <b>inspired</b> by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles.|$|E
5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V <b>who</b> <b>inspired</b> Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|The loud {{volume of}} the band's live show {{influenced}} the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The <b>Who</b> <b>inspired</b> mod revival bands, particularly the Jam, which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius <b>who,</b> <b>inspired</b> by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E
5|$|Susan Eloise Hinton (better {{known as}} S. E. Hinton) is an American author who {{is best known}} for writing young adult fiction. The Outsiders was Hinton's first {{published}} book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen. Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage gangs and alienated youth in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s. The Outsiders has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, The Outsiders became a movie, and was later released onto DVD. After experiencing a writer's block and going into a state of depression, Hinton met somebody in her freshmen biology class, <b>who</b> <b>inspired</b> her to continue writing.|$|E
5|$|Some bootlegs {{consist of}} private or {{professional}} studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These {{might be made}} from private recordings {{not meant to be}} widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The <b>Who,</b> <b>inspired</b> the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the Nuggets series of albums.|$|E
