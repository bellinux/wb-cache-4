From the Sea of Galilee north to Lake Hula the boundary was drawn between 50 and 400 meters east of the upper Jordan River, keeping that stream entirely within Mandatory Palestine.

Sectional {{electric drives}} are used on different sections {{of a machine}} where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making the paper sheet shrinks as it passes around steam heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919.

25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the original cover.

Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E

On {{the west side}} of the road, a 40-foot <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> of ground was removed, revealing one grave and potentially destroying others. The contractor reported the find to Kent County Council, who through Maidstone Museum contacted archaeologist Brian Philp, who initiated a six-day rescue excavation under the auspices of the new Kent Archaeological Research Groups' Council's emergency scheme. They excavated and recorded 14 graves, and recorded another 2 in a pipe-trench. In November 1966, further construction revealed more graves, this time on the east side of the A21. With further construction proposed, Philp and his team launched a largescale rescue excavation of the western end of the cemetery through the West Kent Border Archaeological Group, assisted by other groups in the region and the Council for Kentish Archaeology. In total, they revealed 68 graves, and the small hut. KARU discovered four further graves in an isolated group to the west of the cemetery in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The Northern {{boundary}} between the British and French mandates was defined in broad terms by the Franco-British Boundary Agreement of December 1920. That agreement placed {{the bulk of the}} Golan Heights in the French sphere. The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise border and mark it on the ground. The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923. Under the treaty, Syrian and Lebanese residents would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lake Hula, Lake Tiberias, and the Jordan River as citizens of the Palestine Mandate, but the government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of the lakes. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to include as much water sources as possible to Palestine during the demarcating negotiations. These constant demands influenced the negotiators and finally led to the inclusion of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the Jordan river, Lake Hula, Dan spring, and part of the Yarmouk. The High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, had demanded full control of the Sea of Galilee. The new border followed a 10-meter <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> along the northeastern shore.|$|E

500|$|The Exchange, on Princes Street 400 metres {{south of}} The Octagon, was the {{original}} financial heart of the city, but the CBD has drifted north to its current location on George Street. Princes Street still contains many of the city's older and more stately business properties, particularly in the few blocks from The Exchange south. This area is also the lowest part of the street, as it descends from the remains of Bell Hill. [...] This area, now several hundred metres inland {{from the edge of}} the Otago Harbour, was the site of the original landing place of settlers from the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin. The two ships, the John Wickliffe and the Philip Laing, arrived in early 1848. As they could not negotiate the harbour, they set anchor at the Otago Heads. Settlers from the ships travelled by smaller rowing boat from there to Dunedin. Massive reclamation of the area led to the creation of a <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> of land, since occupied by commercial premises, warehousing, and the main rail line. The original nature of the site is reflected in the names of Jetty Street and Water Street, both of which cross Princes Street close to the Exchange.
