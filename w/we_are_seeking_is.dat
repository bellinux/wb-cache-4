As Ogden Nash points out, one does not expect to encounter English words containing LLL-or, for that matter, EEE or SSS. Re cently, I had occasion to peruse a listing of tetragrams derived from the Second Edition of Webster's International Unabridged Dictionary and found that these triplets apparently do occur in English words. The list was obtained by putting every word in the dictionary on IBM punch cards and then sorting for four-letter groupings. The results are printed in alphabetical order and show EEER, LLLE and SSSH each appearing {{in at least one}} English word. Was this a machine error, or do such words actually exist? By diligent combing of the list, it is possible to add one more letter to each chain by searching for the tetragram ending with the triplet. In this way we find that we are looking for words contai. ning CEEER, ALLLE and ESSSH. We also find that there is a word with OSSSH. In all cases it seems likely that we are dealing with compound words made up of a word ending in a doublet and a suffix appended without a hyphen.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the unity and {{diversity}} of psychologyhas always been of special interest to psychologists of personality. For example, in the handbook by Brody and Ehrlichman (2000), the final chapter covers two points: {{the first of these}} is biological integration; the second is the integration of the different psychological methods. In Funder’s book (2001) we find, both in the third chapter devoted to methodology and {{in the rest of the}} chapters, an effort to integrate the knowledge from behavioural genetics, evolutionism, psychoanalysis, social psychology, the psychology of learning, of motivation and of cognition, attained through different approaches and methodologies, to conclude, in the final chapter, with an explicit proposal for the integration of cognitive social psychology and psychology of the personality. In Pervin’s (1998) manual, we find from the first chapter onwards an integrated conception of the three most important methodologies for psychology: clinical, correlational and experimental. From the point of view of content this author considers, following Schrest (1976), that psychology of personality can’t be sustained, only, on individual differences so it needs the knowledge of emotions, cognitions and social scenarios in order to describe the psychological organization of the person. It is interesting to consider the expression «sharing objectives», used by Pervin for describing what he understands by integration, which (as we can see in the remaining chapters of his book) would consist in considering as elements of personality not only traits, but also cognitions and motivations. However, as we shall see below, in the last decade many psychologists from different specialities and fields have become keenly interested in this controversy. UNITY BASED ON INTEGRATION It important to stress that when we refer to the possible need for a single, unified psychology it should not be confused with any of the major theories that have been developed in the past, since these theories were constructed on the basis of a reduction of the object of study, while what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>is</b> to maintain the complexity of the object of study of psychology.

40|$|In 1920, J. W. Alexander proved that, if M 3 is {{a closed}} {{orientable}} three-dimensional manifold, then {{there exists a}} covering M 3 →S 3 that branches over a link [same Bull. 26 (1919 / 20), 370 – 372; Jbuch 47, 529]. In the paper under review, the author proves a precision, piquant reformulation of Alexander's result: M 3 is a closed orientable three-manifold, {{then there is a}} threefold irregular covering M 3 →S 3 that branches over a knot; exactly two points of M 3 cover each point of the singular set (the branching knot), one point with index of branching one; the other, with index of branching two. H. M. Hilden has independently proved the same theorem [ibid. 80 (1974), 1243 – 1244]. Suppose that g is the genus of M 3, let both Xg and Xg′ denote a handlebody of genus g, and let φ:∂Xg→∂Xg′ be a homeomorphism for which Xg∪φXg′ is a Heegard splitting of M 3. Let B and B′ both denote three-cells, and let A be a collection of g+ 2 disjoint arcs properly imbedded in B; let A′ be a similar collection of arcs in B′. Hilden constructs two irregular three-fold coverings p:Xg→B and p′:Xg′→B′; the covering p branches over A and the covering p′, over A′. The homeomorphism φ:∂Xg→∂Xg′ (or a homeomorphism isotopic to φ) projects to a homeomorphism γ:∂B→∂B′ such that γ(A∩∂B) =A′∩∂B′ and such that A∪γ|(A∩∂B) A′ is a knot in B∪γB′, the three-sphere. The branched covering <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>is</b> p∪p′:Xg∪φXg′→B∪γB′. The author proves the theorem differently. Let L denote two unliked trivial knots, K 1 and K 2, in S 3, and let Σ 3 denote the symmetric group on 0, 1, 2. The assignment of a meridian of Ki to the transposition (0 i) (i= 1, 2) induces a representation π 1 (S 3 −L) →Σ 3 and, thereby, a three-fold irregular covering, p:Σ 3 →S 3, branched over L. The manifold Σ 3 is S 3, and p− 1 (Ki) contains exactly two curves, one with branching index one, the other, K˜i, with branching index two (i= 1, 2). Furthermore, the curves of p− 1 (Ki) are unknotted and unlinked. Now surgery on an appropriate μ-link L in Σ 3 produces the manifold M 3 [W. B. R. Lickorish, Ann. of Math. (2) 82 (1965), 414 – 420]. We can assume that each component of L cuts K˜ 1 ∪K˜ 2 in exactly two points, and we can find a second-regular neighborhood Vj for each component kj of L such that p(Vj) is a three-cell and such that p(Vj) ∩L consists of two disjoint arcs (j= 1,⋯,μ). Appropriate surgery on the solid tori V 1,⋯,Vμ in Σ 3 induces surgery on the corresponding three-cells p(V 1),⋯,p(Vμ), and one obtains a three-fold, irregular covering M 3 →S 3, branched over a link. Then, applying tools he developed in a previous paper [Rev. Mat. Hisp-Amer. (4) 32 (1972), 33 – 51], the author modifies the covering so that branching occurs over a knot. ...|$|E
40|$|It is our {{intention}} {{in the course}} of the development of this thesis to give an account of how intersubjectivity is "eidetically" constituted by means of the application of the phenomenological reduction to our experience in the context of the thought of Edmund Husserl; contrasted with various representative thinkers in what H. Spiegelberg refers to as "the wider scene" of phenomenology. That is to say, we intend to show those structures of both consciousness and the relation which man has to the world which present themselves as the generic conditions for the possibility of overcoming our "radical sol itude" in order that we may gain access to the mental 1 ife of an Other as other human subject. It is clear that in order for us to give expression to these accounts in a coherent manner, along with their relative merits, it will be necessary to develop the common features of any phenomenological theory of consdousness whatever. Therefore, our preliminary inquiry, subordinate to the larger theme, shall be into some of the epistemological results of the application of the phenomenological method used to develop a transcendental theory of consciousness. Inherent in this will be the deliniation of the exigency for making this an lIintentional ll theory. We will then be able to see how itis possible to overcome transcendentally the Other as an object merely given among other merely given objects, and further, how this other is constituted specifically as other ego. The problem of transcendental intersubjectivity and its constitution in experience can be viewed as one of the most compelling, if not the most polemical of issues in phenomenology. To be sure, right from the beginning we are forced to ask a number of questions regarding Husserl's responses to the problem within the context of the methodological genesis of the Cartesian Meditations, and The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. This we do in order to set the stage for amplification. First, we ask, has Husserl lived up to his goal, in this connexion, of an apodictic result? We recall that in his Logos article of 1911 he adminished that previous philosophy does not have at its disposal a merely incomplete and, in particular instances, imperfect doctrinal system; it simply has none whatever. Each and every question is herein controverted, each position is a matter of individual conviction, of the interpretation given byaschool, of a "point of view". 1. Moreover in the same article he writes that his goal is a philosophical system of doctrine that, after the gigantic preparatory work. of generations, really be-. gins from the ground up with a foundation free from doubt and rises up like any skilful construction, wherein stone is set upon store, each as solid as the other, in accord with directive insights. 2. Reflecting upon the fact that he foresaw "preparatory work of generations", we perhaps should not expect that he would claim that his was the last word on the matter of intersubjectivity. Indeed, with 2. 'Edmund Husserl, lIPhilosophy as a Rigorous Science" in Phenomenology and theCrisis 6 fPhilosophy, trans". with an introduction by Quentin Lauer (New York. : Harper & Row, 1965) pp. 74 [...] 5. 2 Ibid. pp. 75 [...] 6. 3. the relatively small amount of published material by Husserl on the subject we can assume that he himself was not entirely satisfied with his solution. The second question we have is that if the transcendental reduction is to yield the generic and apodictic structures of the relationship of consciousness to its various possible objects, how far can we extend this particular constitutive synthetic function to intersubjectivity where the objects must of necessity always remain delitescent? To be sure, the type of 'object' here to be considered is unlike any other which might appear in the perceptual field. What kind of indubitable evidence will convince us that the characteristic which we label "alter-ego" and which we attribute to an object which appears to resemble another body which we have never, and can never see the whole of (namely, our own bodies), is nothing more than a cleverly contrived automaton? What;s the nature of this peculiar intentional function which enables us to say "you think just as I do"? If phenomenology is to take such great pains to reduce the takenfor- granted, lived, everyday world to an immanent world of pure presentation, we must ask the mode of presentation for transcendent sub [...] jectivities. And in the end, we must ask if Husserl's argument is not reducible to a case (however special) of reasoning by analogy, and if so, tf this type of reasoning is not so removed from that from whtch the analogy is made that it would render all transcendental intersubjective understandtng impos'sible? 2. HistoticalandEidetic Priority: The Necessity of Abstraction 4. The problem is not a simple one. What is being sought are the conditions for the poss ibili:ty of experi encing other subjects. More precisely, the question of the possibility of intersubjectivity is the question of the essence of intersubjectivity. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>is</b> the absolute route from one solitude to another. Inherent in this programme is the ultimate discovery of the meaning of community. That this route needs be lIabstract" requires some explanation. It requires little explanation that we agree with Husserl in the aim of fixing the goal of philosophy on apodictic, unquestionable results. This means that we seek a philosophical approach which is, though, not necessarily free from assumptions, one which examines and makes explicit all assumptions in a thorough manner. It would be helpful at this point to distinguish between lIeidetic ll priority, and JlhistoricallJpriority in order to shed some light on the value, in this context, of an abstraction. 3 It is true that intersubjectivity is mundanely an accomplished fact, there havi. ng been so many mi. llions of years for humans to beIt eve in the exi s tence of one another I s abili ty to think as they do. But what we seek is not to study how this proceeded historically, but 3 Cf• Maurice Natanson;·TheJburne in 'Self, a Stud in Philoso h and Social Role (Santa Cruz, U. of California Press, 1970. rather the logical, nay, "psychological" conditions under which this is possible at all. It is therefore irrelevant to the exigesis of this monograph whether or not anyone should shrug his shoulders and mumble IIwhy worry about it, it is always already engaged". By way of an explanation of the value of logical priority, we can find an analogy in the case of language. Certainly the language 5. in a spoken or written form predates the formulation of the appropriate grammar. However, this grammar has a logical priority insofar as it lays out the conditions from which that language exhibits coherence. The act of formulating the grammar is a case of abstraction. The abstraction towards the discovery of the conditions for the poss; bi 1 ity of any experiencing whatever, for which intersubjective experience is a definite case, manifests itself as a sort of "grammar". This "grammar" is like the basic grammar of a language in the sense that these "rulesil are the ~ priori conditions for the possibility of that experience. There is, we shall say, an "eidetic priority", or a generic condition which is the logical antecedent to the taken-forgranted object of experience. In the case of intersubjectivity we readily grant that one may mundanely be aware of fellow-men as fellowmen, but in order to discover how that awareness is possible it is necessary to abstract from the mundane, believed-in experience. This process of abstraction is the paramount issue; the first step, in the search for an apodictic basis for social relations. How then is this abstraction to be accomplished? What is the nature of an abstraction which would permit us an Archimedean point, absolutely grounded, from which we may proceed? The answer can be discovered in an examination of Descartes in the light of Husserl's criticism. 3. The Impulse for Scientific Philosophy. The Method to which it Gives Rise. 6. Foremost in our inquiry is the discovery of a method appropriate to the discovery of our grounding point. For the purposes of our investigations, i. e., that of attempting to give a phenomenological view of the problem of intersubjectivity, it would appear to be of cardinal importance to trace the attempt of philosophy predating Husserl, particularly in the philosophy of Descartes, at founding a truly IIscientific ll philosophy. Paramount in this connexion would be the impulse in the Modern period, as the result of more or less recent discoveries in the natural sciences, to found philosophy upon scientific and mathematical principles. This impulse was intended to culminate in an all-encompassing knowledge which might extend to every realm of possible thought, viz., the universal science ot IIMathexis Universalis ll • 4 This was a central issue for Descartes, whose conception of a universal science would include all the possible sciences of man. This inclination towards a science upon which all other sciences might be based waS not to be belittled by Husserl, who would appropriate 4 This term, according to Jacab Klein, was first used by Barocius, the translator of Proclus into Latin, to designate the highest mathematical discipline.. 7. it himself in hopes of establishing, for the very first time, philosophy as a "rigorous science". It bears emphasizing that this in fact was the drive for the hardening of the foundations of philosophy, the link between the philosophical projects of Husserl and those of the philosophers of the modern period. Indeed, Husserl owes Descartes quite a debt for indicating the starting place from which to attempt a radical, presupositionless, and therefore scientific philosophy, in order not to begin philosophy anew, but rather for the first time. 5 The aim of philosophy for Husserl is the search for apodictic, radical certitude. However while he attempted to locate in experience the type of necessity which is found in mathematics, he wished this necessity to be a function of our life in the world, as opposed to the definition and postulation of an axiomatic method as might be found in the unexpurgated attempts to found philosophy in Descartes. Beyond the necessity which is involved in experiencing the world, Husserl was searching for the certainty of roots, of the conditi'ons which underl ie experience and render it pOssible. Descartes believed that hi~ MeditatiOns had uncovered an absolute ground for knowledge, one founded upon the ineluctable givenness of thinking which is present even when one doubts thinking. Husserl, in acknowledging this procedure is certainly Cartesian, but moves, despite this debt to Descartes, far beyond Cartesian philosophy i. n his phenomenology (and in many respects, closer to home). 5 Cf. Husserl, Philosophy as a Rigorous Science, pp. 74 ff. 8 But wherein lies this Cartesian jumping off point by which we may vivify our theme? Descartes, through inner reflection, saw that all of his convictions and beliefs about the world were coloured in one way or another by prejudice: [...] . at the end I feel constrained to reply that there is nothing in a all that I formerly believed to be true, of which I cannot in some measure doubt, and that not merely through want of thought or through levity, but for reasons which are very powerful and maturely considered; so that henceforth I ought not the less carefully to refrain from giving credence to these opinions than to that which is manifestly false, if I desire to arrive at any certainty (in the sciences). 6 Doubts arise regardless of the nature of belief - one can never completely believe what one believes. Therefore, in order to establish absolutely grounded knowledge, which may serve as the basis fora "universal Science", one must use a method by which one may purge oneself of all doubts and thereby gain some radically indubitable insight into knowledge. Such a method, gescartes found, was that, as indicated above by hi,s own words, of II radical doubt" which "forbids in advance any judgemental use of (previous convictions and) which forbids taking any position with regard to their val idi'ty.,, 7 This is the method of the "sceptical epoche ll, the method of doubting all which had heretofor 6 Descartes,Meditations on First Philosophy, first Med., (Libera 1 Arts Press, New York, 1954) trans. by L. LaFl eur. pp. 10. 7 Husserl,CrisiS of Eliroeari SCiences and Trariscendental Phenomenology, (Northwestern U. Press, Evanston, 1 7,p. 76. 9. been considered as belonging to the world, including the world itself. What then is left over? Via the process of a thorough and all-inclusive doubting, Descartes discovers that the ego which performs the epoche, or "reduction", is excluded from these things which can be doubted, and, in principle provides something which is beyond doubt. Consequently this ego provides an absolute and apodictic starting point for founding scientific philosophy. By way of this abstention. of bel ief, Desca'rtes managed to reduce the worl d of everyday 1 ife as bel ieved in, to mere 'phenomena', components of the rescogitans:. Thus:, having discovered his Archimedean point, the existence of the ego without question, he proceeds to deduce the 'rest' of the world with the aid of innate ideas and the veracity of God. In both Husserl and Descartes the compelling problem is that of establ ishing a scientific, apodictic phi'losophy based upon presuppos itionless groundwork [...] Husserl, in thi. s regard, levels the charge at Descartes that the engagement of his method was not complete, such that hi.

That <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> a pseudoconvex (real) function such that the normal cone at each boundary point of each of its lower level sets contains the set value of the multivalued map at the same point.

For example, in the intestinal tissue the epithelial lining is organized into crypts that are maintained by a niche of stem cells. The behavior of the system 'as a whole' is considered {{to emerge from the}} functioning and interactions of its parts. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> here <b>is</b> a conceptual framework to demonstrate how the "fate" of intestinal crypts is an emergent property that inherently arises from the complex yet robust underlying biology of stem cells. Results We establish a conceptual framework in which to formalize cross-level principles in the context of tissue organization. To this end we provide a definition for stemness, which is the propensity of a cell lineage to contribute to a tissue fate. We do not consider stemness a property of a cell but link it to the process in which a cell lineage contributes towards tissue (mal) function. We furthermore show that the only logically feasible relationship between the stemness of cell lineages and the emergent fate of their tissue, which satisfies the given criteria, is one of dominance from a particular lineage. Conclusions The dominance theorem, conceived and proven in this paper, provides support for the concepts of niche succession and monoclonal conversion in intestinal crypts as bottom-up relations, while crypt fission is postulated to be a top-down principle. </p...|$|R

In 1661, the Jesuit Relations reported:What caused us greater concern was the intelligence that met us upon entering the Lake, namely, that the men deputed by our Conductor for the purpose of summoning the Nations to the North Sea, and assigning them a rendezvous, where they were to await our coming, had met their death the previous Winter in a very strange manner.

Using a disruptive experience in an immersive theatrical storytelling performance as a catalyst to deconstruct and raise consciousness about the author’s privilege and her own role in research, this article seeks to unpack the politics at play in qualitative research in social and political psychology. The extent to which our privileged role and our identity as researchers are nested in history, in systems, and in structures is explored, and the risk that this shields us {{from being able to}} truly understand the reality, or epistemology, of the vulnerable groups <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> to investigate, <b>is</b> examined. The notion of unknowing the researcher’s vulnerability in research is discussed, along with the ways in which systems and structures have allowed researchers to maintain emotional control and dominance in knowledge production. Moreover, through othering vulnerable emotions and legitimising a researcher’s position as emotion-free, value-free, neutral, and objective, we may continue to engender epistemological injustice. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of reflexivity and re-searching researchers’ humility as ways to address this challenge...|$|R
40|$|The article {{builds on}} prior {{arguments}} that research {{on issues of}} social justice in education has often lacked constructive engagement with education policy-making, and {{that this can be}} partly attributed to a lack of clarity about what a socially just education system might look like. Extending this analysis, this article argues that this lack of clarity is perpetuated by a series of contradictions and dilemmas underpinning ‘progressive’ debate in education, which have not been adequately confronted. At the heart are dilemmas about what constitutes a socially just negotiation of the binarised hierarchy of knowledge that characterises education in the UK, Australia and elsewhere. Three exemplar cases presented from contemporary education curriculum policy in England and Australia are used to illustrate these dilemmas. We then extend this argument to a series of other philosophical dilemmas which haunt education and create tensions or contradictions for those concerned with social justice. It <b>is</b> maintained that <b>we</b> need to confront these dilemmas in efforts to extend conceptual clarity in what it <b>is</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> to achieve, which in turn can better equip us to provide the empirical and conceptual information necessary to effectively engage policy-making to remediate inequalities in education...|$|R

Everyone, hopefully, is committed to truth as an ideal (and indeed logically must be, at the risk of self-referential incoherence), and the ideal of a world that is free from, or at least has a greatly diminished amount of, violence is widely shared.
