5000|$|European hares are {{primarily}} herbivorous. They may forage for wild grasses and weeds {{but with the}} intensification of agriculture, they have taken to feeding on crops when preferred foods are not available. During the spring and summer, they feed on soy, clover and corn poppy as well as grasses and herbs. During autumn and winter, they primarily choose winter wheat, and are also attracted to piles of sugar beet and carrots provided for them by hunters. They also eat twigs, buds and the bark of shrubs and young fruit trees during <b>winter.</b> <b>Cereal</b> crops are usually avoided when other more attractive foods are available, the species appearing to prefer high energy foodstuffs over crude fibre. When eating twigs, hares strip off the bark to access the vascular tissues which store soluble carbohydrates. Compared to the European rabbit, food passes through the gut more rapidly in the hare, although digestion rates are similar. They sometimes eat their own green, faecal pellets to recover undigested proteins and vitamins. [...] Two to three adult hares can eat more food than a single sheep.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{variables}} {{responsible for}} inter-annual {{variations in the}} <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> yield in Spain were identified and climate information was translated into crop production. Empirical orthogonal functions and correlation analyses were applied to regional and large-scale climate variables to ascertain the links between climate and <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> yield. Interactions between climate and <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> productivity in Spain can be summarized as follows: {{the start of the}} growing season depends on minimum temperature, and crop maturity is affected by drought, maximum temperature, sea-level air pressure, moisture fluxes, and the jet stream, as well as by indices of the Scandinavian Pattern, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Southern Oscillation. A statistical approach has been derived to describe variability in cereal productivity in Spain taking into account the previous potential predictors. In general, the best atmospheric conditions for increasing <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> productivity in Spain are warmer winters, cooler and wet springs, with prevalent meridional circulation at upper levels. The observed trend of increasing sea level pressure toward the western Mediterranean could cause a loss in the <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> yield.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} propose methods to {{identify}} croplands cultivated with <b>winter</b> <b>cereals</b> {{in the northern}} region of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Thus, temporal profiles of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS sensor, from April to December of the 2000 to 2008, were analyzed. Firstly, crop masks were elaborated by subtracting the minimum NDVI image (April to May) from the maximum NDVI image (June to October). Then, an unsupervised classification of NDVI images was carried out (Isodata), considering the crop mask areas. According to the results, crop masks allowed the identification of pixels with greatest green biomass variation. This variation might be associated or not with <b>winter</b> <b>cereals</b> areas established to grain production. The unsupervised classification generated classes in which NDVI temporal profiles were associated with water bodies, pastures, <b>winter</b> <b>cereals</b> for grain production and for soil cover.

40|$|Capsule. In winter, {{grassland}} sites {{had greater}} bird numbers compared to winter cereals, {{but a number}} of species of conservation concern were exclusively recorded on winter cereals. Aims. To compare the winter bird communities in grassland and <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> fields. Methods. Grassland and <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> fields were surveyed for overwintering birds in a landscape of mixed grassland and arable agriculture. Results. Generalized Linear Models demonstrated that total bird abundance, the mean abundance of the majority of ecological groups and that of several common species, were significantly greater in grassland compared with <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> fields. However, a number of species of conservation concern, e. g. Skylark Aluda arvensis, were observed only on <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> fields. Only a minority of bird variables showed a positive response to field size. Of these, total bird species richness and the Shannon and Simpson 2 ̆ 7 s diversity indices showed positive significant responses to increasing field size, which may alternatively and perhaps more correctly be interpreted as a positive response to field boundary density within the farmed landscape. Conclusions. Farmland habitats are important for the provision of overwintering resources for birds, and policy directed towards bird conservation should target the management of locally significant habitat types. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the proposed revision of the Common Agricultural Policy in 2014, particularly the proposed measure for crop diversification...|$|E

Therefore, in-field production practices would be helpful to aid in reduction of nitrate leaching and movement to water systems. One practice identified in the science assessment for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy is use of a <b>winter</b> <b>cereal</b> rye (Secale cereal L.) cover crop, where a mean 31 % (29 % standard deviation) nitrate-N reduction would be expected, but with a 6 % (22 % standard deviation) corn yield decrease (SP 435).

However, the impacts of winter rye on crop productivity differ among geographic areas and production systems, including the influence on N recycling and corn N fertilization requirement. With N returned to the soil as cover crop biomass degrades, is it immobilized by microbial processing of the cover crop biomass, or is it added to plant-available N during annual crop N uptake?

The data set comprised 17 NDVI/MODIS images, from April to December of the 2000 - 2008 series.

Then, an unsupervised classification of NDVI/MODIS images was carried out, considering the crop masking areas. The Isodata algorithm was used in this classification (five to ten classes and 100 iterations). According to results, the method of crop masking allowed to identify cropping areas with high NDVI variation, from April to December. The unsupervised classification could distinguish five crop classes.
