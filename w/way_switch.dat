500|$|Control of a Leslie {{speaker is}} {{normally}} catered for by an external two <b>way</b> <b>switch,</b> between two settings marked [...] "chorale" [...] and [...] "tremolo". The switch is mounted onto the controlling instrument, so the player can easily switch settings. Some earlier models {{were limited to}} [...] "off" [...] and [...] "tremolo", and some later models had all three settings. The switch can be used while notes are being played, {{and the sound of}} changing between the two settings is part of the characteristic sound. On both settings, the treble horn rotates slightly faster than the bass woofer; about 50 revolutions per minute (rpm) for [...] "chorale" [...] and 400 rpm for [...] "tremolo", compared to the woofer's 40 rpm and 340 rpm respectively.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other guitars in the S, SA, and SV line, SZ {{have only}} 3 <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> for its H-H configurations, while each pickup {{features}} an indidvidual volume knob. There's also one main tone knob.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} SZ, the Z has hybrid graphics, {{originally}} NVIDIA GeForce 9300M GS {{as well as}} Mobile Intel 4 Series Express 4500MHD chipsets; more recently the Nvidia chip is a 330m.

50|$|The Modern Player Telecaster {{is offered}} in two {{distinct}} styles: a Plus model and a Thinline model. The Plus utilizes a pine body, a standard Telecaster pickup {{in the neck}} position, a reverse wound single-coil strat-pickup in the middle position and a humbucker in the bridge position. It is equipped with coil tapping and a five <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> to provide seven different pickup combinations.|$|E
50|$|The station {{lay on a}} ledge 294 ft {{above sea}} level {{which had to be}} quarried into the hill side. The station was {{immediately}} outside a 1312 yd long tunnel through St. Boniface Down. A lack of space meant that a turntable was used to allow steam engines to runaround their trains. In later years this was replaced by a three <b>way</b> <b>switch.</b> The various tracks merged just before the tunnel and the locomotives had to enter the tunnel during their runround manoeuvres.|$|E
50|$|A major {{extension}} of Predator series, {{there are two}} different makes of the fretboard one made with rosewood and the other with maple. The fretboard made with rosewood is made in Korea and Vietnam. While the maple fretboard is only made in Vietnam. Its body is made using poplar. Made in the available colors, Black and Candy Apple Red, Sunburst, Metallic Dark Blue, or Metallic Titanium finish. It's made with 2 Peavey custom designed humbucking pickups, with a three <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> selector. Manufactured in 1999-2000.|$|E

5000|$|Later, another {{model of}} the Grabber was produced, called the Gibson G3. This bass had three {{stationary}} pickups mounted in the neck,bridge and middle positions. A three <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> {{was added to the}} control scheme so that the pickups could be activated as humbucking pairs; neck & middle, bridge & middle, or all three in humbucking configuration for the so-called [...] "buck and a half". Although very similar, the Grabber and G3 have different and unique sounds which lead players to prefer one over the other.|$|E
5000|$|The newest of {{the series}} the 'Predator Plus ST' is {{available}} in six colors; Gloss Black, Candy Apple Red, Topaz Blue, Transparent Purple, Transparent Amber and Transparent Black. It's made with 2 Peavey custom USA designed humbucking pickups, with a three <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> selector. The body is made of solid basswood, with a premium AAA quilt maple top on transparent finish versions, and binding. It has a maple bolt-on neck with 5 bolts and 25.5" [...] scale length. The fret board is made from rosewood and there are 24-frets that are 2.7 mm wide × 1.1 mm tall and 4 mm white dots are inlaid on the frets.|$|E

This wire is required when multiway switches will be used such as two 3 way switches used to control one or more lights from 2 separate locations. Depending on the configuration, typically black represents hot/feed from the service panel and the other black to the load (light), with the white and red serving as the travelers. In some variations, the white wire recoded (retaped) black will be required as a traveler.

50|$|In June 2016 ESP Guitars {{announced}} that Kelliher had started endorsing their guitars {{and that they}} would be releasing 2 signature models for him, the high end ESP Bill Kelliher and the more affordable LTD BK-600. The guitars are both of the Eclipse body style with full thickness mahogany bodies with no waist cut, 3 piece mahogany set through necks with 22 fret ebony fretboards and 24.75 scale lengths. Hardware wise they feature locking tuners and Tone Pros tunomatic and stoptail locking bridges. They use Bills signature Lace Dissonant Aggressor pickups wired with a 3 <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> and single volume and tone knobs. They will be available in Military Green Sunburst Satin finishes with bound bodies and headstocks and ESP flag inlays.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Fender marketed {{what they}} called their [...] "Tele-Bration" [...] year (a {{portmanteau}} of Telecaster and Celebration). This was the 60th anniversary of the Telecaster design, which was the original design by Leo Fender and the world's first successful, mass-produced, bolt-on neck guitar. As part of this, the American made Cabronita was created. Like the Custom Shop versions, these used TV Jones TV Classic pickups, but in a limited color pallet, and always with two pickups. The tone knob was deleted and in its place was a three <b>way</b> <b>switch.</b> This switch was a simple toggle design rather than a blade design, which was unusual for a Telecaster. These models were only manufactured {{for a short period}} of time. They cost slightly more than a Fender American Standard guitar, but priced at a fraction of a Custom Shop version.|$|E

5000|$|Forming {{the basis}} of the S3L {{inverter}} is a hard-switching three-level inverter of this kind with a T-type topology. This base design is supplemented by a snubber circuit consisting of a few passive components. It prevents the occurrence of simultaneously high values of voltage and current, and hence high power dissipation values, during the switching process. All switching processes therefore take place in a [...] "soft" [...] manner. In this <b>way</b> <b>switching</b> losses are largely avoided. Furthermore, because the snubber circuit functions, in principle, without losses, the conversion efficiency of the inverter remains high even for high values of the switching frequency.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} year, Fender began {{production of}} a less expensive Cabronita by shifting production to their Ensenada, Mexico factory and using their own Fidelitron pickups, under their Classic Series line of Telecasters. This pickup was similar in both look and design to the TV Jones pickup, sharing the same basic dimensions and mounting style. Although the tone was different, it still provided a high quality sound. Like the American version, the Mexican built (often informally abbreviated as MIM for Made in Mexico) had two pickups, a single volume control and a three <b>way</b> <b>switch.</b> At the same time, they also produced a Thinline version (semi-hollow) that was identical except for the body type. Most were built of alder, with the single exception of the white blonde models that used swamp ash, which allowed the grain to show through the translucent white finish. Unlike most imported Telecasters, it had 22 frets.|$|E
5000|$|In Mid-2007 Rondo {{introduced}} two {{variations on}} the standard SJM, one with 3 P-90 pickups, a 5 <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> and 2 tone controls (the same control arrangement as on the Fender Stratocaster). The output jack on this model {{is on the side}} of the guitar. Also introduced is a 24" [...] scale model, the same scale as the Fender Jaguar. They also changed the pickup covers and knobs on the sunburst and black models from cream to black in accordance with a popular user mod. A newer model (SJM-62H) is also available with two humbucker pickups instead of the soapbar P-90 and with knurled chrome metal control knobs instead of plastic. Another newer model is the SJM-62ST [...] "stop-tail" [...] version which features a bridge/tailpiece array much like that used on Gibson guitars, consisting of an intonable bridge and a stout, heavy fixed tailpiece anchored into the guitar body via threaded inserts and height-adjustable studs. This gives the guitar very good sustain characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 Vuorinen {{started using}} an ESP custom shop {{version of the}} Horizon known as the EV-1. The EV-1 has an alder body, maple neck (neck through construction), ebony fingerboard, Seymour Duncan pickups (a Duncan Custom TB-5 in the bridge, a SHR-1n Hot Rails in the middle, and a SH2-n Jazz in the neck), 5 <b>way</b> <b>switch,</b> single volume control and a gold Floyd Rose tremolo system. He {{regularly}} used two during live shows, a purple one tuned to DGCFAD and a white one tuned to EADGBE. After the release of Dark Passion Play in 2007 he toured with a new signature guitar, the EV-2. This was {{very similar to the}} purple EV-1, but now had a tone control and a large decal on the body known as the [...] "Harem Girl". The third incarnation of the series, the EV-3 appeared in 2012 featuring the Imaginaerum cover art and no middle pickup. On the band's 2012/13 Imaginaerum World Tour, Vuorinen used the EV-1 and EV-3. During rehearsals for Nightwish's eighth album Emppu has been using a new custom guitar, built for him by Ruokangas Guitars.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we perform µsec {{time scale}} {{analysis}} on energy consumption behavior of the SSD Write operation and exploit this information to extract key technical characteristics of SSD internals: channel utilization policy, page allocation strategy, cluster size, channel switch delay, <b>way</b> <b>switch</b> delay, etc. We found that some SSDs adopt a multi-page cluster as a write unit instead of a page. We found that SSDs adopt significantly different ways of exploiting channel-level and way-level parallelism to maximize write throughput, which governs the peak current consumption. The X 25 M(Intel) emphasizes the performance aspect of SSDs and linearly increases the channel parallelism as the IO size increases. The MXP(Samsung) puts more emphasis on energy consumption aspect of SSD and controls the degree of parallelism to reduce the peak current consumption. Cluster size of the X 25 M and the MXP correspond to one and eight pages, respectively. The current consumed when writing a page to NAND flash varies significantly depending on the NAND model(17 mA- 35 mA). ...|$|E
