5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On {{the advice of a}} cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Canada shortly thereafter, probably early in 1697. In 1698 {{he was assigned}} to the mission of the Immaculate Conception in the Illinois country (then under French control as part of Louisiana). The mission had been founded by Father Jacques Gravier and served a confederacy of tribes, among them the Kaskaskias, Cahokias, Peorias, Tamaroas and Michigameas. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> assignment Marest had hoped for on his first arrival in North America.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

He {{described himself as}} [...] "totally flabbergasted", adding [...] "I didn't really think it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> record {{that was going to}} win awards". Crowley promised to use the money to fund his music. He was one of eight nominees who performed at the awards ceremony. He is a friend of fellow nominee Valerie Francis.|$|E
500|$|Wenger was {{inspired}} by Borussia Mönchengladbach {{as a child and}} was later influenced by Total Football, a playing style developed by Rinus Michels at Ajax in the 1970s. He recollected the team as having [...] "perfect players everywhere and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> football I wanted to be playing myself". At Monaco, he employed a 4–4–2 formation, though he did trial 4–3–3, akin to Michels'. Wenger is an advocate of 4–4–2 as [...] "no other formation is as efficient in covering space", but has used it sparingly in recent seasons.|$|E

500|$|Beyond the European continent, folk metal is {{relatively}} rare {{with only a}} few known acts including the aforementioned The Lord Weird Slough Feg and their fellow Americans Agalloch. The latter's music [...] "made for a stark geographical anomaly, since its eclectic, avant-garde folk-metal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing one would expect to emerge from Scandinavia -- not Portland, Oregon." [...] Tuatha de Danann is another geographical anomaly with their Celtic metal from Brazil. Moreover there is also Skiltron who play Scottish Celtic Metal who hail from Argentina, Conrad a Folk Metal band from Barbados, The Nine Treasures from China, Orphaned Land from Israel, Myrath from Tunisia, Tengger Cavalry from Mongolia.|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> person who might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|Critics of Stelmach suggest that, as {{a farmer}} {{from the central}} part of the province, he is biased against Calgary and urban Alberta in general. They pointed to the fact that the city, which was {{considered}} the heartland of Jim Dinning's support during the leadership race, had only three members (Ron Liepert, Ron Stevens, and Greg Melchin) in his first eighteen-member cabinet (Stelmach supporters pointed out that Edmonton had only one minister, Dave Hancock). Stelmach also found himself in a feud with Calgary mayor Dave Bronconnier during his first year as premier as Bronconnier accused Stelmach of failing to keep a promise to the city regarding infrastructure spending during his first budget. Several Stelmach supporters suggested that the mayor, a Liberal, might be angling to take over as leader of the official opposition if Kevin Taft fumbled. During the by-election to fill Ralph Klein's Calgary Elbow seat, P.C. candidate Brian Heninger went so far as to tell a voter he'd like to choke his party's leader (Stelmach told media that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> enthusiasm he wanted from his MLAs). [...] Heninger was defeated by Liberal Craig Cheffins and, in the 2008 election, Calgary was the only area of the province in which Stelmach lost seats on his way to an increased majority.|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Justices {{could not}} agree, however, whether {{and to what}} extent the Eighth Amendment imposed a {{proportionality}} requirement in noncapital sentencing proceedings. Justice Antonin Scalia, as is typical of his originalist interpretation of the Constitution, introduced historical evidence in support of his argument that the Eighth Amendment imposes no proportionality requirement at all. Justice Anthony Kennedy argued in favor of a vague proportionality principle that allowed the Court to uphold Harmelin's sentence. And Justice Byron White argued that Harmelin's sentence <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "excessive" [...] sentence forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.|$|E

Nobody {{in those days}} did that. When {{he came out and}} started to sing, he just elevated that audience immediately. Within the first eight bars he had them {{in the palm of his}} hand."

Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, said Vang did not express any embarrassment over this cheating. Fadiman added [...] "it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao's reputation — as, for example Ted Kennedy's fudged Spanish exam at Harvard University tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> man who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules." ...|$|E
