30|$|It seems {{surprising}} that <b>wrack</b> {{did not have}} a strong effect on birds, but this is consistent with other studies. Dugan et al. (2003) found no association between winter shorebird richness or abundance with the mean cover of <b>wrack</b> on 15 southern California beaches, even though invertebrate prey availability was directly associated with wrack; only the abundance of snowy plovers and black-bellied plovers was associated with the amount of <b>wrack</b> on a beach. This previous study, though it measured <b>wrack</b> rigorously over two-weeks in the fall, did not match <b>wrack</b> and bird data from the same surveys, potentially explaining why our approach was able to detect broader associations with <b>wrack</b> both within and among sites. Still, the associations we did see with <b>wrack</b> were limited and inconsistent, either because birds do not aggregate where there is <b>wrack,</b> or because our measures of <b>wrack</b> were too coarse, or because <b>wrack</b> was relatively rare on these beaches. In comparison, the abundance of <b>wrack</b> seems more strongly associated with the richness of shorebirds at Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County sites where <b>wrack</b> is more abundant overall (J. Dugan pers. Comm.).|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of detached macrophytes from seagrass meadows and reefs, {{otherwise known as}} <b>wrack,</b> has been identified {{in some parts of}} the world as a marine subsidy which can increase the productivity of coastal ecosystems. The aim of this study was to determine whether <b>wrack</b> deposits act as a marine subsidy on sandy beaches in Perth, by determining whether it influences the structure of, and is a source of nutrient to, the macroinvertebrate communities in this ecosystem. This was achieved by examining the abundance, composition and nutrient source of macrofauna, including epifauna, infauna and flying fauna, on three sandy beaches with high <b>wrack</b> coverage and three beaches with low or no <b>wrack</b> coverage in the Perth metropolitan area. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was conducted on macroinvertebrates and potential sources of production to determine whether they were gaining nutrients from marine or terrestrial primary production. There was a clear difference in the volume of <b>wrack</b> between beaches with high and low volumes of <b>wrack,</b> while sediment moisture and organic matter showed no difference between the two categories of beaches. High <b>wrack</b> beaches all had similar volumes of <b>wrack</b> present, while <b>wrack</b> was either absent or in very low volumes on low <b>wrack</b> beaches. There were strong differences between high <b>wrack</b> beaches and low <b>wrack</b> beaches in the abundance and taxa richness of macroinvenebrates caught using quadrats and cores. Epibenthic and infaunal macroinvertebrates, predominantly beetles and flies, were consistently present on high <b>wrack</b> beaches, whereas few, if any, individuals were found on low <b>wrack</b> beaches. No differences occurred for adult flies caught using sticky traps. Stable isotope analyses indicated that marine-derived <b>wrack</b> was the main source of nutrients for macroinvertebratcs on beaches containing <b>wrack</b> material. δ 13 C values of <b>wrack</b> ranged from - 5. 79 to - 17. 47 %o, while terrestrial vegetation had much lower values, around - 27. 01 %o. All macroinvertebrates δ 13 C values were similar to those of <b>wrack,</b> ranging from - 8. 56 to - 20. 77 %o. The δ 15 N values indicated that spiders, staphylinid beetles and beetle larvae occupied a higher trophic level than other consumers; they are likely to be predators of other fauna within <b>wrack</b> accumulations. It therefore appears that macro invertebrates are utilizing <b>wrack</b> as a source of both shelter and food. There was a lack of differences in macrofauna abundance among <b>wrack</b> beaches and between zones for high <b>wrack</b> beaches. This is most easily explained by the absence of any significant differences in the volume and distribution of <b>wrack</b> among beaches and between zones. Family composition did differ among beaches, a result that is likely to be related to the variability in <b>wrack</b> characteristics such as composition and age. The results indicate that <b>wrack</b> is acting as a marine subsidy for macroinvertebrates on Perth beaches. The removal of <b>wrack</b> is likely to result in the loss of macrofauna assemblages from sandy beaches in Perth, or changes in the abundance and composition of those assemblages. This is likely to influence the food web in the sandy beach ecosystem, the magnitude of which is not yet fully understood...|$|R

Cores, <b>wrack</b> quadrats, and pitfall traps were used to sample four beaches, all having vehicle-free sections next to ORV corridors. A manipulative experiment was performed by directly driving over wrack-filled, nylon-mesh bags colonized by beach invertebrates and subjected to traffic treatments. ^ Pitfall traps at the wrackline had higher invertebrate abundances in vehicle-free than in high-traffic zones on all four beaches. <b>Wrack</b> abundance was higher on vehicle-free beaches. However, <b>wrack</b> quadrats (with intact <b>wrack)</b> and cores taken beneath them showed no consistent differences in invertebrate abundances in traffic and non-traffic areas. Talitrid amphipods Talorchestia longicornis and lycosid spiders Arctosa littoralis, both diurnal burrowers in supratidal bare sands as adults, were less abundant in traffic sections of beach. Other invertebrates, e. g., oligochaetes and tethinid flies (Tethina parvula), living within/beneath <b>wrack,</b> were not affected by traffic. ^ In the direct impact study, the tenebrionid beetle Phaleria testacea (85 % larvae) was less abundant in disturbed <b>wrack</b> bags than in controls, while Tethina parvula (90 % larvae) showed increases in disturbed <b>wrack.</b> Nonetheless, ORVs adversely affected invertebrates, by killing/displacing some species and by lowering the total <b>wrack</b> amount. Therefore, on beaches with moderate traffic levels, alternating opening/closing of adjacent beaches to vehicle traffic may allow <b>wrack</b> invertebrate recolonization and population recovery. ^ <b>Wrack</b> manipulative studies were used to isolate the influences of <b>wrack</b> location and proximity to dune vegetation, clump size and composition on macrofaunal assemblages. <b>Wrack</b> deposits were colonized primarily by wrack-associated species, including semi-terrestrial and terrestrial groups, with few dune grass or swash zone species. Across-shore location affected macrofaunal abundances and community structure, independent of <b>wrack</b> age, with high-tide line deposits attracting the most individuals.

40|$|Accumulations of seagrass, macroalgae {{and other}} organic materials, collectively known as <b>wrack,</b> {{commonly}} occur on sandy beaches worldwide, and {{are critical to}} the functioning of these ecosystems. On the upper beach, the deposition of <b>wrack</b> debris provides habitat and food for rich supralittoral macrofauna of crustaceans and insects, which cannot be found in any other environment and play key roles in the ecosystem functioning. Despite this, the removal of <b>wrack</b> debris is a widespread practice on sandy beaches, {{and there is little}} information regarding the effects of such <b>wrack</b> removal on associated macroinvertebrates. The general aim of this thesis is to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation in the distribution and utilization of <b>wrack</b> debris by supralittoral arthropods and its biological responses to <b>wrack</b> removal, which, in turn, is relevant to the management of this key resource (i. e. <b>wrack</b> debris) on sandy beaches. 	We investigated the influence of the spatial distribution and the relative ageing of upper <b>wrack</b> deposits on the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages on six sandy beaches located at Brazilian and Spanish Atlantic coasts (Chapter 1). We found that, independently of the <b>wrack</b> composition, the spatial distribution of <b>wrack</b> deposits at different tidal levels (i. e. bands) on the upper beach influence the structure of supralittoral assemblages. Bands <b>wrack</b> play a role shaping the density of dominant taxa (i. e. Talitridae, Tenebrionidae and Staphylinidae) on Atlantic sandy upper shores. In the Chapter 2, the abiotic factors that could influence the distribution of supralittoral arthropods was analysed in relation to the deposition and location of <b>wrack</b> debris at two Spanish Atlantic beaches. We found differences in the community structure and composition between microhabitats (bare and wrack-covered areas), due to the influence of <b>wrack</b> deposits on the habitat selection by arthropod species. The labile organic matter (BPC) combined with temperature or moisture mostly explained the distribution pattern of assemblages. Changes of these habitat features in relation to the ageing of <b>wrack</b> debris play an undeniable role in the utilization of <b>wrack</b> by supralittoral arthropods, and therefore, in the spatial distribution of species between <b>wrack</b> bands. These results provided evidences about the role of algal <b>wrack</b> structuring assemblages (diversity and composition) of supralittoral arthropods. 	The colonization process by supralittoral arthropods at naturally strandlines was investigated in the Chapter 3. For this, we manipulated the presence of stranded <b>wrack</b> and then monitored the wrack-associated fauna after the stranding of new <b>wrack</b> debris on the Atlantic upper beaches (southern Brazil and south-western Spain) for a 47 -day period. Our results showed that naturally stranded <b>wrack</b> debris can be promptly invaded by a wide range of colonizer species (i. e. talitrid, dipterans, tenebrionids, staphylinids, and spiders) that indicate high heterogeneity of habitat and/or food sources available for supralittoral arthropods in natural driftlines. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the colonization of strandlines was slower in southern Brazil (16 -day period) than in south-western Spain (3 -day period). This process was driven by changes in the densities of Talitridae, Staphylinidae, and Tenebrionidae species in both regions. Moreover, beetles of Cleridae and Nitidulidae also contributed to colonizer community in southern Brazil (Paraná region). The dynamics of <b>wrack</b> supply, the species-specific adaptations (i. e. mobility) and strategies to use <b>wrack</b> debris (as refuge and/or feeding site) could explain the different colonization patterns of assemblages in both Atlantic regions. 	The direct effect of <b>wrack</b> removal on the community structure and composition was analysed using a manipulative experiment, where we evaluated the biological responses before and after to remove all organic debris detached at the Atlantic upper shores (Chapter 4 and 5). We found that a short-term <b>wrack</b> removal resulted in detectable changes in the density of some species, mainly talitrid amphipods, and therefore in community structure, but these was rapidly recovered, although the timing of recovery was more protracted for supralittoral assemblages of southern Brazil than did of south-western Spain. The temporal variability of <b>wrack</b> biomass and the specie-specific adaptations of invertebrates inhabiting strandlines might determine the response of the supralittoral assemblages to <b>wrack</b> removal on beaches located at both sides of Atlantic Ocean. 	This thesis increases our knowledge concerning the interaction between <b>wrack</b> debris and supralittoral macroinvertebrates, highlighting the role of stranded organic materials in shaping communities as shelter, breeding and/or feeding sites. Moreover, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that the removal of <b>wrack</b> debris affect the structure and composition of supralittoral assemblages. Therefore, <b>wrack</b> debris should be considered a key component on sandy beaches because it provides habitat and food for supralittoral macroinvertebrates, forming islands of biodiversity which support coastal food webs. The conservation of <b>wrack</b> debris and the reduction of human impact on associated fauna are crucial to maintain the functional integrity of beach ecosystems.

40|$|In coastal salt marshes, mats of <b>wrack</b> (dead plant stems) {{that are}} {{deposited}} on the marsh by high tides can kill underlying vegetation and initiate secondary succession. The importance of <b>wrack</b> disturbance in northwest Atlantic salt marshes {{has been a}} topic of recent debate. The importance of <b>wrack</b> disturbance in southwest Atlantic salt marshes, which experience a very different climate regime than do northern marshes, has rarely been examined. Working in a Georgia salt marsh, we documented a pattern of positive association between <b>wrack</b> and Batis maritima biomass, and conducted experiments that indicated that <b>wrack</b> was beneficial to Batis maritima. Sampling indicated that natural <b>wrack</b> deposition was correlated with areas of vigorous Batis growth and mild soil conditions. Natural <b>wrack</b> deposition occurred primarily at the highest elevations occupied by Batis maritima (the high Batis zone). Batis plants in the high zone were taller, with more and larger leaves, and contained several times the biomass/unit area than Batis plants at lower elevations. High zone soils had lower salinities, better percolation rates, and a lower organic content than did soils from lower elevations. Experimental manipulations demonstrated that deposition of <b>wrack</b> was partially responsible for these patterns. In each of two experiments, soil salinities were lower and plants taller and larger {{in the presence of}} <b>wrack</b> compared to in its absence. Although <b>wrack</b> lowered salinities and enhanced plant growth, the effects were not large enough to completely explain the differences between Batis zones. Instead, <b>wrack</b> probably reinforced pre-existing gradients in flooding and salinity caused by differences in elevation and terrestrial runoff. Our results contrast with previous studies from northern marshes. Because of geographic differences in climate and plant phenology, northern marshes are more likely than southern marshes to receive patches of <b>wrack</b> thick enough to kill underlying vegetation. Plants covered by thin layers of <b>wrack,</b> as commonly occurs in southern marshes, may often grow through the <b>wrack</b> rather than suffer mortality. Also because of climatic differences, <b>wrack</b> is more likely to benefit plants by ameliorating salinity stress in southern marshes, where soil salinities are often hypersaline, than in northern marshes where soils are rarely hypersaline. Although ecological processes may differ between northern and southern salt marshes, these differences may be predictable based on an understanding of geographic variation in climate...|$|R

Five <b>wrack</b> burial depths were applied: control without <b>wrack,</b> 1 cm (1235 ± 92 g DW <b>wrack</b> m- 2), 2 cm (3266 ± 13 g DW m- 2), 4 cm (4213 ± 277 g DW m- 2), and 8 cm (6138 ± 227 g DW m- 2). Sediment pH, electrical conductivity, redox potential and temperature were recorded. Quiescence increased with <b>wrack</b> load up to ~ 20 % at 8 cm deep. Germination decreased with <b>wrack</b> load from 96 % to 14 %, {{which could be}} related with anoxic conditions under the debris since sediment redox potential was as low as - 83 ± 7 mV at 8 cm.

During the same season <b>Wrack</b> also spent a month on loan at Shrewsbury Town, featuring in five games for Fred Davies's [...] "Shrews". During the 1997-98 season, with the club now under the tenure of Alan Buckley, <b>Wrack</b> failed to make an impact in the first team with the likes of Kevin Donovan, Tommy Widdrington and Paul Groves favoured over <b>Wrack.</b> <b>Wrack</b> would only feature twice for Grimsby under Buckley this season, a Football League Trophy victory over Hull City and a league defeat to Northampton Town. Grimsby earned promotion back to the First Division via the play-offs as well as winning the Football League Trophy in a Wembley double, however <b>Wrack</b> did not feature in either occasion. Speaking in 2006, <b>Wrack</b> stated that he felt he was [...] "never given the chance to shine" [...] at Blundell Park.|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Biological Sciences, 2009 This study {{examined}} wrack-associated macrofaunal communities in northern California, providing base line data and documenting potential prey for federally threatened Western Snowy Plovers. I investigated three hypotheses regarding beach <b>wrack</b> macrofaunal ecology: (1) Sandy beach macrofauna exhibit habitat selection based on <b>wrack</b> availability, preferring macroalgal <b>wrack</b> deposits to bare sand. (2) Experimental <b>wrack</b> patches in the moist intertidal zone are more hospitable {{then in the}} drier, supratidal zone therefore macrofauna would exhibit preferences for intertidal <b>wrack</b> patches. (3) On northern California beaches, macrofauna abundance varies across taxa, {{as it does in}} central California and Spain and predicted the density of talitrid amphipods would be greater than other <b>wrack</b> associated taxa. Macrofauna exhibited a significant preference for <b>wrack</b> deposits over bare sand habitat. Although not significant, abundance differed among intertidal and supratidal <b>wrack</b> deposits and between years. Some inter-annual variation was partially explained by variation in weather conditions. When data from both years were combined, mean taxonomic richness peaked on day nine and declined significantly by day twenty one. Community composition varied significantly between <b>wrack</b> and sand and between years. Dipteran flies, primarily larvae, were the most numerous taxonomic group comprising 50 % of all macrofauna collected. In 2007, talitrid amphipods were proportionally the second most abundant taxa; in 2008, they were the least numerous. Off Highway Vehicle impacts may have reduced talitrid amphipod populations in 2008. Trophic level implications include possible reduced prey for Western Snowy Plovers and other shorebirds...|$|R

40|$|Kelps, fucoids {{and other}} large brown {{seaweeds}} are common and important features of temperate coastal zones. The British Isles is a centre for seaweed diversity in the NE Atlantic, but, despite numerous surveys, an incomplete picture of the distribution remains. Survey data and herbarium specimens were {{used to examine the}} environmental preference of 15 species of large brown seaweeds, covering the orders Laminariales (kelps), Fucales (<b>wracks)</b> and one species of Tilopteridales. Habitat suitability models were developed to estimate broad-scale distribution and area of habitat created by these species around the British Isles. Topographic parameters were important factors limiting distributions. Generally, temperature {{did not appear to be}} a limiting factor, probably because the British Isles lies in the centre of the NE Atlantic distribution for most species, and not at climatic tolerance limits. However, for the recent migrant Laminaria ochroleuca, temperature was found to be important for the model, thus range expansion could continue northwards provided dispersal is possible. In contrast, the widespread Alaria esculenta showed a negative association with warmer summer temperatures. The total potential habitat around the British and Irish coastline is more than 19, 000 km(2) for kelps and 11, 000 km(2) for <b>wracks,</b> which represents a significant habitat area similar in scale to British broadleaf forest. We conclude that large brown algal species need to be managed and conserved in a manner that reflects their scale and importanc...|$|E
40|$|The <b>wracks</b> of Posidonia oceanica {{leaves and}} the “banquette” {{formation}} on the sandy beaches of Calabria {{are one of}} the most important defence against the erosion processes. The management of the beach-cast sea-grass in Italy has been, generally,realized through the mechanical removal and the transport in dumping of the beachcast material. This system, apparently simple and fast, produces, instead, a net loss of sediments from the sandy beaches and,therefore, a deficit in the sedimentary budget of coastline leading the coastal system to possible shore erosions. The ideal solution is to keep these vegetable deposits on spot so to warrant a positive sedimentary budget, the protection of coastline and the tourist value of the regional beaches to improve tourism in the seaside resorts with bathing vocation...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} are a subfield of spatial ecology, and these patterns modify the temporal dynamics and stability properties of population densities {{at a range}} of spatial scales. Localized ecological interactions can generate striking large-scale spatial patterns in ecosystems through spatial self-organization. Possible mechanisms include oscillating consumer–resource interactions, localized disturbance–recovery processes, and scale-dependent feedback. However, in this paper, our main aim is to study the effect of tide on the pattern formation of a spatial plant-wrack model. We discuss the changes of the wavelength, wave speed, and {{the conditions of the}} spatial pattern formation, according to the dispersion relation formula. Both the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations reveal that the tide has great influence on the spatial pattern. More specifically, typical traveling spatial patterns can be obtained. Our obtained results are consistent with the previous observation that <b>wracks</b> exhibit traveling patterns, which is useful to help us better understand the dynamics of the real ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} hydrodynamic effects on the formation of beach <b>wrack</b> at three locations in the northern Baltic Sea and to quantify the differences between the composition of species found in the beach <b>wrack</b> and in the neighbouring sea. Hydrodynamic measurements and modelling indicated that the beach <b>wrack</b> was mostly of local origin and that it was formed during high sea level and wave events. Comparison of the methods of beach <b>wrack</b> sampling and seabed sampling (diver, underwater video) demonstrated that beach <b>wrack</b> sampling can be considered an alternative tool for describing the species composition of macrovegetation in near-coastal sea areas. Although the hydrodynamic variability is greater in autumn and more biological material is cast ashore, the similarity between the two sampling methods was higher in spring and summer...|$|R

Sci., 84 (1) : 1 - 22, 1985. The successional cycle of macroinvertebrates colonizing high intertidal beach <b>wrack</b> islands, decaying clumps of stranded kelp, were examined on a central California high energy beach. Samples from <b>wrack</b> algae and the underlying sand were taken at periodic intervals following island deposition. Mean density and number of different species fluctuated in regular and complementary patterns. Multivariate analysis distinguished early, mid, and late colonizing species. Dipterans and amphipods were initial colonizers succeeded largely by Coleoptera. Temporal changes in faunal populations are attributed to physical and biological factors degrading the <b>wrack</b> and reducing its potential as a resource. Beach <b>wrack</b> is a major nutrient source and substrate shelter {{for a majority of}} indigenous beach fauna...|$|R
