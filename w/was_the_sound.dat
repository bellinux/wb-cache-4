5|$|Tom Kitt was {{the music}} {{supervisor}} and orchestrator {{for both the}} Berkeley and Broadway productions. The lead producers for the show were Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce. Vivek Tiwary was another producer. The creative team for the show was largely {{the same as for}} the musical adaptation of Spring Awakening: director Michael Mayer, scenic designer Christine Jones and lighting designer Kevin Adams. Steven Hoggett was the choreographer, Andrea Lauer was the costume designer and Brian Ronan <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> designer.|$|E
5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable {{to submit to the}} strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{a regular contributor to}} the music of the Final Fantasy series. Several other composers including Masayoshi Soken and Naoshi Mizuta contributed music for updates to the game. The {{music for the}} game's reboot, , was primarily composed by Soken, who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> director for both releases of the game. Music from both releases of the game has been released in several albums, though no album contains music from both XIV and A Realm Reborn. A pair of mini-albums containing a handful of selected tracks from XIV, Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks, were released by Square Enix in 2010 when XIV first launched. A soundtrack album titled Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers, containing most of the music that had been released by that point for XIV, was digitally released in 2012. A final soundtrack album for the original release of the game, Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, was released in 2013 just before the launch of A Realm Reborn, and contains all of the music that was composed for XIV throughout its lifetime. The latest soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack, was released in 2014, and contains all of the music for A Realm Reborn released up to that point.|$|E

A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony.

Budgie <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> engineer of the album, and he mixed it near Toulouse before its release in 2003. After recording four studio albums as the Creatures, Budgie's final performance with Siouxsie (featuring Eto and the Millennia Ensemble) was filmed in 2004 at the Royal Festival Hall in London for the DVD Dreamshow. This was Budgie's last concert and collaboration with Siouxsie; in 2007, the pair publicly announced their divorce.|$|E
500|$|Following El Cid, Fields <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> editor {{on several}} lesser-known films, {{including}} the experimental film The Balcony (1963) with her Savage Eye colleagues Strick and Maddow. Peter Bogdanovich's first, low-budget film Targets (1968) {{was one of}} her last sound-editing projects, and represents her mature work. Bill Warren has described the scene in which the character Bobby starts sniping at freeway drivers from the top of a large oil storage tank: [...] "The sound is mono, and brilliantly mixed -- the entire sequence of Bobby shooting from the tanks was shot without sound. Verna Fields, then a sound editor, added all the sound effects. The result is seamlessly realistic, from the scrape of the guns on the metal of the tanks, to the crack of the rifles, to the little gasps Bobby makes just before firing." ...|$|E

500|$|Maken Shao: Demon Sword, {{known in}} Japan simply as Maken Shao, was {{developed}} by Atlus for the PlayStation 2. Hashino returned as director. Okada, Hashino and Kaneko returned to their respective roles. The additional CGI segments were created by Polygon Magic. While the basic gameplay and the original plot were carried over, several adjustments were made. The biggest change was a shift from a first-person to a third-person perspective; this was done due to a recurring problem with Japanese gamers dubbed [...] "3D sickness", where people became motion sick when playing first-person games. Another improvement <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> environment, which made full use of Doubly Surround software. The title's added [...] "爻" [...] character, an archaic Chinese symbol, was used as it represented two [...] "X" [...] characters, showing the game's status as an evolved version of Maken X.|$|E
500|$|Verna Fields (née Hellman; 21 March 1918 [...] 30 November 1982) was an American film editor, {{film and}} {{television}} sound editor, educator, and entertainment industry executive. In {{the first phase of}} her career, from 1954 through to about 1970, Fields mostly worked on smaller projects that gained little [...] recognition. She <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> editor for several television shows in the 1950s. She worked on independent films (including The Savage Eye (1959)), on government-supported documentaries of the 1960s, and on some minor studio films such as Peter Bogdanovich's first film, Targets (1968). For several years in the late 1960s, she was a film instructor at the University of Southern California. Her one major studio film, El Cid, led to her only industry recognition in this phase of her career, which was the 1962 Golden Reel award for sound editing.|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Brown's footsteps as she ran to the microphone.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} restraints, Seventeen Seconds {{was recorded}} and mixed in seven {{days on a}} budget of between £2000 and £3000, {{which resulted in the}} band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew [...] "A Forest" [...] would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. [...] "A Forest" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals. Fiction Records owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound [...] "radio friendly", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness.

500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. One issue that the production team was [...] "particular" [...] about <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|E

The tour was announced in February 2000, while Spears {{was in the midst of}} the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour. The stage was much more elaborate than her previous tours and featured video screens, pyrotechnics and moving platforms.
