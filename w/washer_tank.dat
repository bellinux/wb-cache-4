50|$|Filling the {{windshield}} <b>washer</b> <b>tank</b> {{was done by}} a capless ball valve, {{right next to the}} capless gas tank ball valve. Volvo surveys had found (among many other things) that female drivers considered caps to be a major nuisance. The car featured run-flat tires, like those of wheeled armoured vehicles, {{in order to be able}} to drive all the way to a garage after a puncture and thus avoid having to change a tire by the side of the road.|$|E
5000|$|For 1962, the Beetle {{received}} a mechanical fuel level gauge {{in place of}} the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge {{until the end of the}} 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A Schrader valve located on the <b>washer</b> fluid <b>tank</b> allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended [...]|$|R
2500|$|Most Buick LeSabre {{models from}} 1986 until 2005 were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine. It {{started out with}} [...] It added balance shafts to become the famous [...] "3800" [...] V6 for 1988, with [...] This engine {{increased}} to [...] in 1991 {{with the addition of}} Tuned Port Injection. The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard. Each year yielded slightly different design changes. 1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substition of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts. In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, <b>washer</b> fluid <b>tank,</b> and coolant overflow tank). For 1990 there was a change {{in the design of the}} front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were more or less identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-The {{objective}} of the present paper is to develop an innovative washer for washing the accumulated sewage inside drinking water <b>tank.</b> This new <b>washer</b> was composed of a semi-passive control actuator and electronic control module. Many outstanding characteristics such as easy installation, cheap, water-saving and friendly associated with this new washer. Especially, {{it was able to}} continue to supply pure drinking water with consumers during washing job was ongoing. When the waiting timer was time out, the washer actuator was energized, and then the solenoid value was alternately turned on and off depended on the setting value of duty cycle. Based on the water hammer effect, the actuator mechanism rotated along the radial axis of tank and wash simultaneously, and its velocity was dependent upon the length or diameter of sewage discharging pipe or the duty cycle of the solenoid valve of controlling electrical signals. In order to verify the feasibility and working performance about proposed new washer, the experimental prototype was first constructed in the laboratory. Moreover, experiments were carried out by using this prototype. Finally, those experimental results clearly point out that new developed actuator for drinking water <b>tank</b> <b>washer</b> is feasible, water-saving and operating friendly. Key-Words:- Drinking water, water tank, semi-passive control actuator, duty cycle, solenoid valve. ...|$|R
