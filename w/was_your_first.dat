2500|$|Leykis denied {{allegations}} that the call {{was part of a}} hoax set up by the show, and producers turned over all information they had about the caller to police who began an investigation. Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program. [...] Geraldo: [...] "So what <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> reaction when you got this call?" [...] Leykis: [...] "I was shocked. You know, people call talk shows and say all kinds of things, but they never confess to murder." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job. It wasn't a script I liked, but I {{remember}} my agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it was just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Was {{caught in}} a regular trap. He had only militia and Indians with him. Good day, Mr. Washington. A pretty nag, sir. That <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> affair, last year?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marry again?" [...] {{he thought}} to himself, as he rang the bell. [...] "Donna Brigida, <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> failure not enough for you? Are you going to try a second time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Miss Kate," [...] {{said the}} captain with {{a twinkle in}} his grey eye, [...] "you told me I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> lodger, so how can you know how much trouble other men would give?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{went there}} last night," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{had only one}} wish--one hope. That was, to see you pleased and happy. I knew it <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> ball, and I did so long to see you enjoy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forgot," [...] he said gently, [...] "that this <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> {{concert at}} the Auditorium. It is {{beautiful}} and splendid, even to an habitué like me. I like {{to come here and}} forget that work or care exists in the world. I shall enjoy it all the more deeply now by reason of your enthusiasm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You had me guessing,' he admitted. 'I couldn't {{figure you}} out. First thing, of course, I thought {{you must be}} working in with Buck MacGinnis and his crowd. Then all that {{happened}} tonight, and I saw that, whoever you might be working in with, it wasn't Buck. And now I've placed you. You're not in with any one. You're just playing it by yourself. I shouldn't mind betting this <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> job, and that you saw your chance of making a pile by holding up old man Ford, {{and thought it was}} better than schoolmastering, and grabbed it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And so {{have the}} others," [...] replied Ozma. [...] "I am glad {{you and the}} Hungry Tiger love Dorothy best, for she <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> friend and companion. Also I am pleased that my Sawhorse loves me best, for {{together}} we have endured both joy and sorrow. Hank has proved his faith and loyalty by defending his own little mistress; and so you are all right in one way, but wrong in another. Our Land of Oz is a Land of Love, and here friendship outranks every other quality. Unless you can all be friends, you cannot retain our love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} all the better for that, Cuffe," [...] {{answered}} the admiral, smiling, a change that converted a countenance that was almost ugly when {{in a state of}} rest into one that was almost handsome--a peculiarity that is by no means of rare occurrence, when a strong will gives expression to the features, and the heart, at bottom, is really sound. [...] "An Englishman has no business with any Gallic tendencies. This young Mr. Griffin seems to have spirit; and I look upon it always as a good sign when a young man volunteers for a desperate thing of this sort--but he tells me he is only second; where <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> all the while?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{condemned}} yourself," [...] {{he went on}} pitilessly. [...] "Condemned {{yourself on}} my processes,--processes familiar to you, applauded by you, accepted by you for years! We {{will go back to}} the time when you first saw the cigar case. Your expressions," [...] he said in cold, deliberate tones, consulting his paper, [...] "were, 'How beautiful! I wish it were mine.' This <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> step in crime--and my first indication. From 'I WISH it were mine' to 'I WILL have it mine,' and the mere detail, 'HOW CAN I make it mine?' the advance was obvious. Silence! But as in my methods it was necessary that there should be an overwhelming inducement to the crime, that unholy admiration of yours for the mere trinket itself was not enough. You are a smoker of cigars." ...|$|E
60|$|MAGISTRATE. This <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> offence, and I {{am going}} to give you a light sentence. [Speaking sharply, but without expression.] One month with hard labour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you? Then <b>your</b> wish <b>is</b> easily granted, {{for there}} <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> {{sight of the}} moor," [...] said Dr. Mortimer, {{pointing}} out of the carriage window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear; what's {{the good}} of going into all that? He has got something. They'll do immensely well, if you'll only listen. She <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perchance, then," [...] {{said the}} German, looking keenly at her, [...] "Raphael has a rival in your heart? He <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> love; but young maidens {{are not always}} constant, and one flame is {{sometimes}} extinguished by another!" [...] Hilda shook her head, and turned away. She had spoken the truth, however, in alleging that torpor, rather than fire, was {{what she had to}} dread. In those gloomy days that had befallen her, it was a great additional calamity that she felt conscious of the present dimness of an insight which she once possessed in more than ordinary measure. She had lost--and she trembled lest it should have departed forever--the faculty of appreciating those great works of art, which heretofore had made so large a portion of her happiness. It was no wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You behaved as I {{expected}} {{you would}} do," [...] Turenne said, {{when he entered}} his room on hearing the bell sound. [...] "You fought close to me {{as long as there}} was fighting to be done, and I observed that you used your sword well. The moment I drew rein you did the same, and took up your post behind me, showing that although this <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> battle you retained your coolness. I will therefore tell you in confidence that Count d'Harcourt has enjoined me to throw provisions, if possible, into the citadel at Turin. It will take me some time to make arrangements, and my only fear is that the garrison, on hearing that we have retired across the Po--of which you may be sure the Spaniards will take care to inform them--may believe that we shall do no more this winter; and as we know that their provisions must be well nigh exhausted, they will abandon the citadel and march thither.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think not}} too, Macumazahn, but small men, small wit. Also like you I am glad {{that it did}} not happen, since it is the Zulus I hate, not the English who have now learned a lesson and will not be caught again. Oh! many a captain in Zululand is to-day flat as a pricked bladder, and even their victory, as they call it, cost them dear. For, mind you, Macumazahn, for every white man they killed two of them died. So, so! In the morning you left the hill--do not look astonished, Macumazahn. Perhaps those captains on the rock beneath you let you go for their own purposes, or because they were commanded, for though weak I can still lift a stone or two, Macumazahn, and {{afterwards}} told me all about it. Then you found yourself alone among the dead, like the last man in the world, Macumazahn, and that dog at your side, also a horse came to you. Perhaps I sent them, perhaps it was a chance. Who knows? Not I myself, for as I have said, my memory has grown so bad. That <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> shock, Macumazahn, the shock of standing alone among the dead like the last man in the world. You felt it, did you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jimmy," [...] Sarah said reproachfully, [...] "that {{might have}} <b>been</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> client. You {{ought to have}} made a {{business}} of finding him some B. & I.'s." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} many people? This <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> {{appearance}} in society? Shall I {{introduce you to}} some nice girls to dance with?" [...] What very pretty buttons!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, gentlemen?" [...] he said, cheerily. [...] "We {{have a fine}} night, {{or rather}} morning; the wind is northerly. I suppose this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> ascent?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Common-knowledge {{questioning}} {{schemes that}} offer account verification and compromise: [...] "What's your mother's maiden name?", [...] "what <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> car model?", or [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> pet's name?", etc.|$|E
5000|$|He awakes {{a second}} time, to find Ravel {{standing}} over him. She asks him what his third wish will be. He replies [...] "to {{know who he}} is" [...] again.

Schachat's early business background was in housing development, serving nine years with the Schachat housing group, Schachat Cullum. The housing group bought most of Ernst Erikson's sprawling Norscot estate in Witkoppen and divided it to create homes. Schachat's former wife described the profile of Schachat Cullum clients: Buying a Schachat Cullum house mean that you were probably professional, probably white, and this <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> time as a home-buyer.|$|E
