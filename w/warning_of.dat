The Kaqchikel {{continued}} their wars against the K'iche' kingdom over the following decade. The Aztec emperor Moctezuma II sent messengers to the Kaqchikel in 1510, <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> strangers in the Caribbean. In 1512 he sent another messenger (named as Witz'itz'il) <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> {{the arrival of the}} Spanish in Yucatán and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|A {{historical}} parallel– to 1931 when Germany was {{burdened with}} debt, unemployment and austerity while France and the United States were relatively strong creditors– gained attention in summer 2012 even as Germany received a debt-rating <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> its own.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{and ships}} headed from Milne Bay to Buna {{and vice versa}} had to pass close to Goodenough Island.

5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel Guillemot, {{operated}} by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, had given <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> a U-boat. In consequence on 28 March 1917 UC-65 surfaced, ordered the crew into their lifeboat, and sank the Guillemot. Against this background the sinking of Irish Oak became a hotly debated issue.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, in {{response}} to the growing tension with Spain over Cuba, which led to the Spanish–American War, the Cape Florida lighthouse was briefly made U.S. Signal Station Number Four. It was one of 36 along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast from Maine to Texas. The Signal Stations were established to provide an early <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> any approach of the Spanish fleet.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> {{their ability to}} defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the risk to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles. Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> penalty charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{having given}} clear <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> his plans, Darius sent ambassadors {{to all the}} cities of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom instead executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now also effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.|$|E

5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E
5|$|During the siege, {{newly elected}} delegates from across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when a <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that {{day for the}} Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E

5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a blackout from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{valuable}} contributions to the Spartan cause, Alcibiades fell out of favor with the Spartan government at around this time, ruled by Agis II. Leotychides, the son born by Agis's wife Timaia shortly after this, was believed {{by many to be}} Alcibiades's son. Alcibiades's influence was further reduced after the retirement of Endius, the ephor who was on good terms with him. It is alleged that Astiochus, a Spartan Admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received <b>warning</b> <b>of</b> this order and defected to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.|$|E
