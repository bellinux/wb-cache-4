40|$|World {{trade of}} clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers {{is a new}} {{research}} {{that is part of}} a series of six reports on world trade of major household appliances (white goods). This survey provides an overview of the world trade of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers, with data and forecast at world-wide level and data on the evolution of appliances trade in 60 countries (selected according to their contribution to international trade of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers). The growth of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers imports and the role of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers exporting countries in the world marketplace are considered. The world imports and exports of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers are broken down by geographical area (European Union, Eastern Europe and Russia, Asia and Pacific, Middle East and Africa, North America, South America) and by developed / emerging countries. The analysis of the opening of clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers markets covers six years, 1999 - 2004. Trade data are also available in a country format: historical series on clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers exports and imports, origin of imports and destination of exports, consumption growth forecast for household appliances 2005 - 2006, country rankings to place all statistics in a broad worldwide context. The report provides a picture of opportunities for clothes <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> driers exporters arising from the increasing openness of markets and a rich collection of key country-data, allowing comparisons among specific interest areas. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{development}} of technology, the robot arm is used widely in different fields; it creates great benefits for companies, thereby, {{it is extremely}} important to design robot arm. Purpose of this project is that inserting four <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> tightens four nuts on bolts. This task is analyzed by four aspects in the report. Firstly, the task can be analyzed based on different method. Rotation of five axes and prismatic of one axes can be selected. Secondly, {{the positions of the}} axes are fixed. Thirdly, the processing of the project is simulated using Flash. Finally, the matrix can obtained using Matlab. Theoretical background and Methodology A task of this project is that to insert four <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> tighten four nuts on four horizontal bolts by using a computer controlled manipulator. The <b>washers</b> <b>and</b> nuts are available from a spring activated parts feeder. The washer should be loaded into the bolt before the nut is screwed on. The task is shown in Figure 1. The coordinate frame of the base of the robot is parallel with the world coordinates (O-XYZ) The robot approaches the nuts <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> from the above in a vertical direction The robot approaches the bolts from the top in a horizontal direction...|$|R
