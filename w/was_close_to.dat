5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their claim <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> {{winning the}} 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him into another tie {{for first place}} with Agdestein. It also {{prevented}} Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever. Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19–21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.|$|E

5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size.

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

5|$|Newton {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism. He <b>was</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.

In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{one set of}} gates, {{beyond which}} there are four exits. Each {{platform}} has an up escalator and an elevator. There are coin lockers near Exit 2.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
