For years, Iranian pilgrims {{had tried to}} stage peaceful political demonstrations in the Muslim holy city of Mecca during the hajj. Iran sees the 1987 massacre of Iranian pilgrims as the first major attack by Sunni extremists like Osama bin Laden and the emerging Al-Qaeda on Shia Iranians.

500|$|The writers {{hoped to}} fool viewers into {{thinking}} that they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> straightforward séance episode, {{and so there is}} little humour prior to the episode's first twist. For Steadman, the writing meant that both the audience and the character of Tina are fooled together. Nonetheless, humour remained elsewhere in the script; Lloyd looked forward to performing a particular joke involving blue paint. Terry refers to his colleagues variously as [...] "Pepe and His Friends", a reference to a variety act with a similar name, and a [...] "warm prop", a disparaging name which, according to the writers, has been used in the film industry to refer to extras.|$|E
40|$|When Michigan {{residents}} {{were asked to}} rate the performance of Jennifer Granholm as Michigan’s Governor, a majority of 57. 8 % indicated that they think she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (42. 8 %) or excellent (15. 0 %) job. Some 42. 2 % think that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> fair (37. 7 %) or poor (4. 5 %) job. This indicates that there has not been much change since Granholm first took office in 2003. Previous State of the State Survey (SOSS- 29) results show that 58. 1 % thought that she <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (48. 2 %) or excellent (9. 9 %) job as governor between January and March of this year. Some 41. 9 % of residents thought that her performance was fair (38. 8 %) or poor (3. 1 %) during that same time (IPPSR 2003). Gender Indifference There is no statistically significant difference between how well men and women think that the Governor <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> • Some 57. 4 % of men think that Granholm <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (40. 8 %) or excellent (16. 6 %) job and 42. 7 % think that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> fair (38. 0 %) or poor (4. 5 %) job. • This is compared to 58. 1 % of women who think that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good (44. 4 %) or excellent (13. 7 %) job and 41. 9 % who think that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> fair (37. 4 %) or poor (4. 5 %) job...|$|R

500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: [...] "Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung".|$|E
500|$|Many in {{the city}} were angered by the broadcast. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors was outraged and sent a letter of protest to CBS. Feinstein wrote to the station manager of KPIX denouncing the episode. She {{compared}} the program to [...] "doing a documentary on Italians and only showing the Mafia". She asked for three minutes of national airtime to respond but CBS denied her request. Armistead Maupin, who had {{worked closely with the}} production team, repudiated the program, saying [...] "I had no idea they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> hit piece." [...] Jeff Jarvis of The San Francisco Examiner wrote, [...] "It's shocking that CBS News, home of Walter Cronkite, would partake of such bigotry." [...] Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Terrence O'Flaherty labeled the documentary [...] "a dreadful little program... deadly for everyone it touches". Nationally, a spokesperson for the National Gay Task Force condemned the documentary for its premise of gays wanting political power for purposes of having sex in public, for ignoring lesbians and for failing to address issues of anti-gay discrimination.|$|E
500|$|A {{second test}} series was required. This {{consisted}} of a single test, known as Grapple X, in November 1957. This time the yield of [...] exceeded expectations. This was a true hydrogen bomb, {{but most of the}} yield came from nuclear fission rather than nuclear fusion. In a third series with a single test, known as Grapple Y, in April 1958, another design was tested. With an explosive yield of about , it remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested. The design of Grapple Y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium-238 tamper, making it a true hydrogen bomb, and because its yield had been closely predicted—indicating that its designers understood what they <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>A</b> final series of four tests in August and September 1958, known as Grapple Z, tested techniques for boosting and making bombs immune to predetonation caused by nearby nuclear explosions. Two of these tests were detonations from balloons; another was a blind radar test drop. A moratorium on testing came into effect in October 1958, and Britain never resumed atmospheric testing.|$|E

500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show as if we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> period piece. We {{see it as a}} contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|E

The greens criticised {{the other parties}} for opposing Barroso's team and then voting in favour anyway, protesting that Barroso [...] "assigned portfolios without respect to the prospective commissioners' competences. Worse still, he moved commissioners from posts where they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good job.

Although having numerous credits in film and on the stage, Lester was an unknown face in television, having had less than two hours' broadcast screen time prior to the first Hustle series. Lester explained that he [...] "couldn't imagine playing the same character for years, but Hustle was completely different.

We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help to get through it. I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E

You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it.

To satisfy America's appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US {{in the middle of}} the year with the addition of the new single [...] "Is There Something I Should Know?". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. [...] "Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty", Rhodes said later, [...] "But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in Times Square. We couldn't get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets."
