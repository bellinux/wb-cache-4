500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. How are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E
500|$|Gig 'em: Both {{a saying}} and the thumbs up hand gesture of all Texas A University {{current and former}} {{students}} as sign of affiliation. Gig 'em also {{is the name of}} an Aggie yell. This tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before the football game against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!".|$|E

500|$|Geoff Johns {{confirmed}} on his Twitter {{account that}} the film had ended principal photography on August 6, 2010 and entered post-production. In an interview with MTV News, director Martin Campbell {{was asked about the}} film's effects-heavy epic scale and commented [...] "It's daunting, just the process, (there are) something like 1,300 visual shots, it's mind-blowing, quite honestly". When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the nice things is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E
500|$|Aggies {{today will}} often end public {{addresses}} and emails to other Aggies with a hearty [...] "Thanks and Gig 'em!". The [...] "Gig 'em" [...] tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before {{the football game}} against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate {{and member of the}} school's Board of Regents, asked [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he answered his own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|The Virginia Tech defense {{looked to}} recover from its slide during the last five games of the regular season. During the Hokies' first eight games (all wins), Tech gave up averages of 10.5points, 267.5total yards and 40.8rushing yards per game. In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack. Head {{defensive}} coach Bud foster said, [...] "... right now {{you just kind of}} have a question mark: Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we're taught to do?" [...] That late-season falter still saw Tech ranked as the No.20 rushing defense in the country heading into the San Francisco Bowl, allowing an average of just 113.31yards per game.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} airing of [...] "The Door", HBO {{released}} a featurette titled [...] "Anatomy of a Scene" [...] which went into greater {{detail about the}} creation of the final scene at the weirwood cave. Bender was interviewed for the segment, and stated [...] "I {{knew it was going to}} be a lot of stunts, a lot of CGI, how were <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it? My goal was to make it realistic, make it terrifying, and make Hodor's sacrifice incredibly moving." [...] Most of the exterior shots with the White Walkers and their army took place at Magheramorne, a small hamlet in County Antrim, Northern Ireland near where Castle Black is also filmed. With input from David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, Bender, as well as visual effects supervisor Joe Bauer, also incorporated a transposing of scenes with Wights also crawling on the ceiling and the walls, which Bender hoped would result in the scene being even more [...] "creepy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{script for}} [...] "Twilight" [...] {{was written by}} Mike Sussman, one of the {{co-producers}} on Enterprise. The producers had considered showing the episode {{later on in the}} series in order to show what could have happened if the Xindi were successful in their attack on Earth, but instead elected to show it earlier in the series to demonstrate the stakes in the storyline during season three. [...] "Twilight" [...] was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, his third directing credit for the series following [...] "" [...] and [...] "". McNeill had previously starred in [...] as Tom Paris. McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for [...] "Twilight" [...] for the first time. He explained that after reading it, he said [...] "Holy crap how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that?" [...] He explained that the episode would see the Enterprise destroyed but wasn't yet sure how they were going to film certain sequences such as the roof being blown off the bridge and the crew being sucked out into space.|$|E
500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation. She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was {{an examination of the}} band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{allegations}} {{in the book}} were claims by Armstrong's former soigneur Emma O'Reilly that a backdated prescription for cortisone had been produced in 1999 to avoid a positive test. A 1999 urine sample at the Tour de France showed traces of corticosteroid. A medical certificate showed he used an approved cream for saddle sores which contained the substance. O'Reilly said she heard team officials worrying about Armstrong's positive test for steroids during the Tour. She said: [...] "They were in a panic, saying: 'What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> What {{are we going to}} do?'" ...|$|E

[...] Neal {{was so great that}} he'd just take out the music paper, no score, [...] — trumpet part, [...] — trumpet part, [...] — {{trombone}} part, , and you'd play it the next day. It was the end.

2500|$|At a yell {{practice}} {{before the}} 1930 TCU game, A Board of Regents member Pinky Downs '06 shouted, [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to those Horned Frogs?" [...] His muse did not fail {{him as he}} improvised, borrowing a term from frog hunting. [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] {{he said as he}} made a fist with his thumb extended straight up. And with that the first hand sign in the Southwest Conference came into being. Interestingly, the [...] "Hook 'em Horns" [...] cheer was also invented by a UT cheerleader prior to the November 12, 1955 UT-TCU game. TCU wound up winning both of these historic games.|$|E
2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, how am I going to get by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at [...] midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E
2500|$|... "We went {{up there}} on a windy day, and it was {{freezing}} cold. Every time we opened a plan it blew away. And we said Christ! What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with these students, {{where are they going}} to sit in the sun and all that? Well, we decided, it's got to be cloisters. All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Travel + Leisure rated New York City the [...] "Dirtiest American City," [...] {{for having}} the most unremoved, {{publicly}} visible litter. The dubious honor was bestowed by votes of both magazine readership and city residents. In dealing with global warming and New York's role in it, Bloomberg has enacted a plan called PlaNYC: A Greener, Greater New York to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare New York for the projected 1 million more people expected {{to be living in}} the city by the year 2030. Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes, delivering the keynote address at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit and stating, [...] "e now know beyond a doubt that global warming is a reality. And the question we must all answer is, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it?" [...] Bloomberg also talked about how he would go about fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, and encouraging public transportation.
