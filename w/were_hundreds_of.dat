5|$|It {{is likely}} that, {{as in other}} {{polygynous}} animals (in which males compete for association with harems of females), Pteranodon lived primarily on offshore rookeries, where they could nest away from land-based predators and feed far from shore; most Pteranodon fossils are found in locations which at the time, <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> kilometres from the coastline.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century.

Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and there <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> deaths. About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs.

5|$|One of {{the effects}} of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the {{introduction}} of stone and brick fortifications. Although there <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of {{herbicides}} was unloaded at Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962. U.S. Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions {{took place over}} the course of Operation Ranch Hand. By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended U.S. Department of Agriculture application rate for domestic use. In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed. In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> times greater than the levels considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states that there <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early}} stages of the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
