5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an area-preserving subdivision schematization algorithm: {{the area of}} each region in the input equals {{the area of the}} corresponding region in the output. Our schematization is axis-aligned, the final output is a rectilinear subdivision. We first describe how to con-vert a given subdivision into an area-equivalent rectilinear subdivision. Then we define two area-preserving contraction operations and prove {{that at least one of}} these operations can always be applied to any given simple rectilinear polygon. We extend this approach to subdivisions and showcase experimental results. Finally, we give examples for standard distance metrics (symmetric difference, Hausdorff- and Fréchet-distance) that show that better schematizations might result in <b>worse</b> <b>shapes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Edmund Burke {{ranks among}} the most {{accomplished}} orators ever to debate in the British Parliament. But often his eloquence has been seen to compromise his achievements as a political thinker. In the first full-length account of Burke's rhetoric, Bullard argues that Burke's ideas about civil society, and particularly {{about the process of}} political deliberation, are, for better or <b>worse,</b> <b>shaped</b> by the expressiveness of his language. Above all, Burke's eloquence is designed to express ethos or character. This rhetorical imperative is itself informed by Burke's argument that the competency of every political system can be judged by the ethical knowledge that the governors have of both the people that they govern and of themselves. Bullard finds the intellectual roots of Burke's 'rhetoric of character' in early modern moral and aesthetic philosophy, and traces its development through Burke's parliamentary career to its culmination in his masterpiece, Reflections on the Revolution in France...|$|R

500|$|Since its creation, {{the program}} has {{received}} much criticism {{both within and outside}} Puerto Rico. Critics argue that, since the program provides non-taxable income without any employment requirements, recipients receive free money without incentives for work, which hinders the economic output and development of the island, especially when Puerto Rico's employment participation and unemployment rates have been consistently inferior to U.S. national levels, while the average aid provided in Puerto Rico has exceeded the U.S. national average ($94 versus $74.79, respectively; 2001 estimate). Because of this, Puerto Rico has been called the [...] "welfare island". People from the Dominican Republic do many of the jobs in Puerto Rico that pay too little to attract the locals. However, proponents of the program argue that Puerto Rico's social condition is in far <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than any of the 50 U.S. states. Approximately half of the island's population lives below the U.S. Federal poverty guidelines, and many have difficulties in meeting their nutritional needs due to increasing inflation and economic stagnation in the island. Furthermore, the relation between the NAP program's benefits and the low employment participation and high unemployment rates has not been studied, and there is no consensus on their actual causes.|$|E

Grandpa George (David Morris) reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Upon meeting him {{on the day of the}} tour, the visitors find Wonka to be peculiar, lonely and acting odd at the mention of [...] "parents". The tour shows how the fantastical factory operates under the efforts of the short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up being caught in the factory workings and have to be safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into a river of chocolate and is sucked up by a pipe before being rescued from the fudge processing center; Violet expands into an oversized blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum despite Wonka's warning; Veruca is thrown away as a [...] "bad nut" [...] by trained squirrels down the garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches in height after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention. [...] During the tour, Wonka has flashbacks from his childhood where he remembers that he had a troubled relationship with his father, Wilbur. Due to his father being a dentist he was forbidden from candy consumption, but after managing to sneak a taste, he became hooked and later ran away from home to live his dream. He then returned several days later to find his father and home completely gone.|$|E

At emancipation some slaveowners reacted by evicting all former slaves from their properties, others negotiated work contracts or sharecropping arrangements.

2500|$|Although {{neglected}} in the historiography of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Rotem Crisis {{was the most}} serious challenge to Israel's doctrine of deterrence in the years between the Suez Crisis and the Six Day War. [...] Haim Laskov described it as the most dramatic event of his tenure. It revealed deficiencies in the Israeli intelligence community, which failed to provide warning of an imminent threat, and in the IDF's ability to translate such warnings into immediate action. Although intelligence had suggested Egyptian forces were on the move, a week went by before {{the full extent of}} the Egyptian deployment came to light and countermeasures were taken. Rabin, a future Chief-of-Staff, later wrote that Israeli intelligence had never been in <b>worse</b> <b>shape.</b> Laskov had lost all faith in the head of military intelligence, Chaim Herzog, but was prevented from dismissing him by Ben-Gurion. The crisis influenced Israeli national security policy, defining any Egyptian military build-up along its border as unacceptable, while the Israeli intelligence community took extensive measures to improve its collection capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he arrived}} in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the {{previous}} three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle {{would enable them to}} avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of no-man's land. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as Army Chief of Staff General Tasker Bliss and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how [...] "the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses". The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British offensive on the Somme two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the German Army was in <b>worse</b> <b>shape</b> than in previous years.|$|E

He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real."

He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that the point is to show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that what you really see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways". Iliadis expressed {{that he did not want}} to go the way of [...] "torture porn", which is what he sees most horror films moving toward, but instead show a sense of [...] "urgency" [...] with the parents' actions.|$|E
