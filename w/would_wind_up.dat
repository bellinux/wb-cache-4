London provided assurances that it would underwrite {{a large amount of}} the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products, even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.|$|E

Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding with Embraer at the Indo Defense 2010 exhibition in Jakarta. Indonesia ordered eight EMB-314 Super Tucanos at first, with an option for another eight on the same terms. The first Super Tucanos were scheduled to arrive in 2012, and the order also included ground-support stations and a logistics package. Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro added that state aircraft maker PT Dirgantara Indonesia would be used for maintenance work, and they also hoped Dirgantara <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> manufacturing some parts and components. Subsequent contracts have ordered a total of 16 of these Super Tucano planes for the Tentara Nasional Indonesia – Angkatan Udara (TNI-AU), Indonesian Air Force.|$|E

500|$|The {{basic model}} is a {{variation}} on the Stackelberg–Cournot [...] "leader and follower" [...] duopoly game. Alternatively, the model can be portrayed in game theoretic terms as initially a game with multiple Nash equilibria, with government having the capability of affecting the payoffs to switch to a game with just one equilibrium. Although it is possible for the national government to increase a country's welfare in the model through export subsidies, the policy is of beggar thy neighbor type. This also means that if all governments simultaneously attempt to follow the policy prescription of the model, all countries <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> worse off.|$|E
500|$|Mills portrayed Abby from 1980–1989. Prior {{to being}} cast in Knots Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting. In an interview with Jerry Buck for the Toledo Blade, Mills said: [...] "I got tired of playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred up, and I like that." [...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character. However, he had a different sense of the character and who <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in the role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.|$|E
500|$|Hunt {{began working}} on tracks for a {{follow-up}} project in 2008. Two songs from those sessions, [...] "Moving Targets" [...] and [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", were included on What Were You Hoping For?. After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for What Were You Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E

500|$|By November 1936, 16,170 pieces {{had been}} sold. Only about 2,000 more {{were sold in}} the next four months; Hoffecker's {{statement}} for March 1937 shows 18,790 sold with an additional 330 on consignment to the First National Bank of Elgin. Rovelstad had received $8,680.00 and Hoffecker $6,576.50. [...] At this point, discussion turned to {{what to do with the}} remaining pieces, some 5,620 (a few hundred pieces were given away or otherwise disposed of). [...] Rovelstad agreed to allow the coin dealer to purchase 250 pieces at $1 each; he was still selling them in 1948. [...] Other dealers were uninterested in large purchases as the direct sale to collectors meant that few who wanted and could afford the Elgin coin lacked it. With demand at a standstill, Hoffecker feared that the remaining pieces <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in the hands of speculators. [...] Five thousand pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|As a result, {{films in}} the late 1920s and early 1930s {{included}} depictions of sexual innuendo, miscegenation, profanity, illegal drug use, promiscuity, prostitution, infidelity, abortion, intense violence, and homosexuality. Strong female characters were ubiquitous in such pre-Code films as Female, Baby Face, and Red-Headed Woman. Gangsters in films like The Public Enemy, Little Caesar, and Scarface were {{seen by many as}} heroic rather than evil. Along with featuring stronger female characters, films examined female subject matters that would not be revisited until decades later in US films. Nefarious characters were seen to profit from their deeds, in some cases without significant repercussions, and drug use was a topic of several films. Many of Hollywood's biggest stars such as Clark Gable, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Blondell and Edward G. Robinson got their start in the era. Other stars who excelled during this period, however, like Ruth Chatterton (who decamped to England) and Warren William (the so-called [...] "king of Pre-Code", who died in 1948), <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> essentially forgotten by the general public within a generation.|$|E

500|$|On December 22, 2012, Ross {{agreed to}} a three-year {{contract}} with the Arizona Diamondbacks worth a reported $26 million, with a club option and a $1 million buyout. An injured left calf caused him to miss {{the beginning of the}} season; he made his return April 13. He began the 2013 season playing right field, but in May {{through the rest of the}} season he split time between right and left field. On June 19, he hit a pinch-hit three-run home run against Mike Dunn in a 3–1 victory over the Marlins. He hit a three-run home run against Matt Harvey to put the Diamondbacks ahead 3–2 on July 3; the Diamondbacks <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> defeating the Mets 5–2.

2500|$|... "Very Tough Love" [...] is a radio {{documentary}} and {{an episode}} of the show This American Life (TAL), which originally aired on March 25, 2011. The segment described a drug court and program in Georgia that is conducted in a manner different from all other drug courts throughout the United States, and often contrary to drug court philosophy, according to standards set by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. People with no criminal record or history of drug abuse or addiction, and charged with possession of small drug quantities <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> under drug court control for five years or more.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson sought to annex Florida from Spain, as {{brokered}} by Napoleon. Congress agreed to the President's request to secretly appropriate purchase money in the [...] "$2,000,000 Bill". The Congressional funding drew criticism from Randolph, who believed that the money <b>would</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in the coffers of Napoleon. The bill was signed into law; however, negotiations for the project failed. Jefferson lost clout among fellow Republicans, and his use of unofficial Congressional channels was sharply criticized. In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its Revolution, and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803. But he refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862. Domestically, Jefferson's grandson James Madison Randolph became the first child born in the White House in 1806.|$|E
