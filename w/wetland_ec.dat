40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a series}} of wetland colonized with Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia molesta to treat the effluent of a giant river prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) broodstock pond was evaluated in this study. The experimental design was completely randomized and was performed in 9 rectangular tanks (1. 6 m(3)) with three treatments (constructed wetlands) and three replicates. The treatment types included: a wetland colonized with E. crassipes and S. molesta (EcSm) arranged sequentially, a wetland with E. crassipes only (Ec) and a wetland with S. molesta only (Sm). The means of suspended particulate material (SPM), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), P-orthophosphate (PO 4 -P) and total phosphorus (TP) of the treated effluents were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (P < 0. 05). The effluent treated in Ec and EcSm wetlands exhibited lower SPM concentrations. The Ec wetland reduced TIN, TKN, PO 4 -P and TP by 46. 0, 43. 7, 44. 4 and 43. 6 %, respectively. In the EcSm wetland, the reduction of TIN (23. 0 %), TKN (33. 7 %) and PO 4 -P (26. 7 %) was similar to the Sm wetland (19. 8 % TIN, 30. 9 % TKN and 23. 8 % PO 4 -P). The Ec wetland was more efficient in treating pond effluent due likely to the higher root surface of E. crassipes, which forms an extensive area favorable to retention and adsorption of debris and absorption of nutrients. Neste estudo foi avaliada a eficiência de uma wetland povoada com Eichhornia crassipes e Salvinia molesta para o tratamento do efluente de um viveiro de manutenção de reprodutores do camarão-da-malásia (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). Um experimento totalmente casualizado foi realizado em 9 tanques retangulares (1, 6 m 3) com 3 tratamentos (wetlands construídas) e 3 repetições. Os tratamentos foram: wetland povoada com E. crassipes e S. molesta (EcSm) dispostas nesta sequência, wetland somente com E. crassipes (Ec) e wetland somente com S. molesta (Sm). Os valores de material particulado em suspensão (MPS), nitrogênio inorgânico total (NIT), nitrogênio Kjeldahl total (NKT), P-ortofosfato (P-PO 4) e fósforo total (PT) dos efluentes tratados foram comparados pela ANOVA seguida do teste de Tukey (P< 0, 05). A <b>wetland</b> <b>Ec</b> reduziu a concentração de NIT, NKT, P-PO 4 e PT em 46, 0 %, 43, 7 %, 44, 4 % e 43, 6 %. Na wetland EcSm a redução de NIT (23, 0 %), NKT (33, 7 %) e P-PO 4 (26, 7 %) foi semelhante à observada na wetland Sm (19, 8 % para NIT, 30, 9 % para NKT e 23, 8 % para P-PO 4). A wetland povoada com E. crassipes é mais eficiente no tratamento do efluente do viveiro, provavelmente devido a maior superfície radicular da macrófita que permite a formação de uma extensa área propícia à retenção e adsorção dos detritos e à absorção dos nutrientes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSoil {{samples were}} {{collected}} along soil profiles in the unrestored and restored wetlands of the Yellow River Delta, China in order to investigate the changes of soil properties along soil profiles after the implement of wetland restoration project in this region in 2005. Results showed that soil pH showed a significant increase (p< 0. 001) from surface (0 - 10 cm) to subsurface soils (10 - 20 cm), while electric conductivity, total nitrogen, soil organic matter and total sulfur dropped sharply from surface to subsurface soils, and then they all kept stable at deeper soil layers in both types of wetlands. Soil pH and electric conductivity decreased after the restoration, while lower soil nutrients (eg. SOM, TN, TS) in top soil were also observed in restored wetland than those in unrestored wetland, except that total concentration of phosphorous and potassium. Total P and K were elevated in restored wetland along soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil pH was significantly correlated with TS and TK in upper soils of the unrestored <b>wetlands,</b> while <b>EC</b> was significantly correlated with TS and TK in the restored wetlands. However, in deeper soil no significant correlations were observed between soil pH or EC with soil nutrients in both wetlands...|$|R
40|$|High Arctic landscapes are {{essentially}} vast cold deserts interspersed with streams, ponds and wetlands. These landscapes {{may be important}} consumers and sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH 4), though few measurements exist from this region. To quantify the flux of CH 4 (F CH 4) between the atmosphere and high Arctic landscapes on northern Ellesmere Island, Canada, we made static chamber measurements over five and three growing seasons at a desert and wetland, respectively, and eddy covariance (EC) measurements at a wetland in 2012. Chamber measurements revealed that, during the growing season, desert soils consumed CH 4 (− 1. 37 ± 0. 06 mg-CH 4 m − 2 d − 1), whereas the wetland margin emitted CH 4 (+ 0. 22 ± 0. 14 mg-CH 4 m − 2 d − 1). Desert CH 4 consumption rates were positively associated with soil temperature among years, and were similar to temperate locations, likely because of suitable landscape conditions for soil gas diffusion. Wetland F CH 4 varied closely with stream discharge entering the wetland and hence extent of soil saturation. Landscape-scale F CH 4 measured by EC was + 1. 27 ± 0. 18 mg-CH 4 m − 2 d − 1 and varied with soil temperature and carbon dioxide flux. F CH 4 measured using EC was higher than using chambers because EC measurements incorporated a larger, more saturated footprint of the <b>wetland.</b> Using <b>EC</b> F CH 4 and quantifying the mass of CH 4 entering and exiting the wetland in stream water, we determined that methanogenesis within wetland soils was the dominant source of F CH 4. Low F CH 4 at the wetland was likely due to a shallow organic soil layer, and thus limited carbon resources for methanogens. Considering the prevalence of dry soils in the high Arctic, our results suggest that these landscapes cannot be overlooked as important consumers of atmospheric CH 4...|$|R
40|$|Ranchland water {{retention}} (WR) on the wetland-upland {{systems in the}} Lake Okeechobee (LO) watershed, for reducing damaging flows to the lake, was evaluated. Water retention was implemented by raising the spillage level at the outlets of a shallow and deep wetland site. Climatic and hydrologic data were collected at two sites to: 1) quantify the evapotranspiration (ET) for two <b>wetlands</b> using Eddy-Covariance (<b>EC)</b> method and develop ET models; 2) construct water budgets to quantify groundwater fluxes; and 3) use a field-verified model, MIKE-SHE/MIKE 11, to evaluate different levels of WR with regards to volume of surface and subsurface flows. EC-based ET for the deep and shallow wetlands was 127 cm/year and 84 cm/year, respectively, and accounted for 93 % and 62 % of annual rainfall (136 cm). Use of commonly used crop coefficient (KC) method with literature KC for estimating ET resulted in 23 % error in ET, highlighting the importance of deriving wetland KC for improved ET estimates. Two regression models were developed, one for predicting KC (R 2 = 0. 58 - 0. 80) and another for daily ET predictions (R 2 = 0. 80). The multi-site evaluation of MIKE-SHE indicated good to very good performance (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, E = 0. 70 - 0. 90) on predicting surface water levels and less than satisfactory to very good (E = 0. 38 - 0. 79) for groundwater levels. Different levels of WR can achieve surface flow reductions of 9 to 20 cm (42 - 86 % reductions compared to baseline) at the deep wetland site, while the reductions were 1 to 24 cm (5 - 93 % reductions) at the shallow wetland site. Although almost all the retained water left as groundwater, WR reduced the flow volume and peak flows. The scale-up analyses for the entire ranchlands within the LO watershed showed a reduction of 2. 1 cm in surface flow and represents a 22 % storage target for the LO watershed. However, these reductions {{are likely to be}} much lower if there is a watershed-scale rise in groundwater levels, and it will take the spillage level of 110 cm to achieve 2. 1 cm reduction. When combined with effects on ranch economic and ecology, results can be used to develop water storage strategies under current and changed climate in the greater Everglades...|$|R
