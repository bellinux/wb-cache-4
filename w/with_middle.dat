5|$|Rather than comply, Detzner led his party, on {{a forced}} march {{north to the}} Markham Valley. His route is uncertain, but his {{description}} of a valley with steep grassy ravines entering from east and west may place {{the latter part of}} his journey in the Langimar Valley, through which flows a tributary of the Watut River. A clash with local people that he describes has been identified as having occurred at Rangama among <b>with</b> <b>Middle</b> Watut people. Once on the Watut itself, the party built rafts and floated downstream to the Markham.|$|E

5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} <b>with</b> <b>middle</b> and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where <b>with</b> <b>Middle</b> Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
