500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

The introduction to [...] "Glaciers of Ice," [...] for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of dyeing Wallabee-styled Clarks. In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained [...] "We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks.

2500|$|Childhood friends Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders {{were born}} and raised in Chicago, United States. At first, they formed a band called Quadraphonics in middle school, with Lewis on guitar, Sanders on drums, DJ Calvin on bass, and [...] "another friend named Edgwick" [...] on guitar. In high school, only Lewis and Sanders stuck together, a time when they {{acquired}} a drum machine, a Moog synthesizer and other equipment used by the burgeoning Chicago house scene. They had discovered house music at high school parties (like Mendel Catholic High School) and nightclubs such as Ron Hardy's Muzic Box, the Power Plant and The Warehouse; the duo also frequented nightclubs in Toronto, Canada. Sanders recalls: [...] "That was '80 or so, '81. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> doing a bunch of music at home. At that time we got a 4-track. So, that's what we would do, go to school, and we would hang out and do music... and go shoot some ball, then work some more music." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|Films and {{television}} programs {{made in the}} 1980s had different visions of what World War III would be like. Red Dawn (1984) portrayed a near future in which a Communist revolution occurs in Mexico, the United States and Britain become strategically isolated from continental Europe, and the Soviet Union is threatened with famine after {{the failure of the}} wheat harvest in Ukraine. World War III subsequently begins unexpectedly, with a surprise Soviet and Cuban invasion of the United States, with large portions of the country falling under Soviet occupation. The central United States and China are obliterated with nuclear weapons and Europe remains neutral. A small band of teenagers fight the occupation forces in Colorado using guerrilla tactics, and are ultimately killed by the Spetsnatz. According to the film's epilogue, the United States repulses Soviet forces and wins the war. In the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy, James Bond tries to prevent World War III from being started by a renegade Soviet general. WarGames (1983) had a teenage gamer accidentally hacking the U.S. nuclear defense network (thinking he'd hacked a computer game company), which reveals a potentially catastrophic flaw in the newly automated system. [...] Spies Like Us depicts US agents in the USSR accidentally launching a missile at the US, leading one of them to say [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> World War III." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece {{was a bunch of}} songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van would come in and we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>started</b> playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were [...] released as the single for the album." ...|$|E
