Pine <b>wood</b> <b>sleeper</b> sapwood contains 0. 25 % of sulphur, but the average pine <b>sleeper</b> <b>wood</b> (sapwood and heartwood) 0. 05 % of sulphur. Most of the sulphur is lost with the pyroligneous vapour and burned in the furnace.

The charcoal of the sapwood portion of sleepers and that of the average <b>sleeper</b> <b>wood</b> will contain 0. 22 % and 0. 035 % of sulphur, respectively. The increase of the carbonisation temperature does not substantially decrease the sulphur content in charcoal, although it is sufficiently low, and the charcoal can be co-fired with clean coal. The considered process is suitable for small power plants, if the biomass input in the common energy balance is 5 to 10 %. If the mean distance of sleepers transportation for Central and Eastern Europe is estimated not to exceed 200 km, the co-combustion of clean coal and carbonized sleepers would be an acceptable option from the environmental and economic points of view...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{possibility}} of using market available glued-laminated timber (GLT) based on melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesives as an alternative to traditional solid timber sleepers. The study comprised an examination of the effect of creosote treatment on the short-term and durability after accelerated aging of the glue lines (delamination and shear strength) and the potential for full sapwood penetration by the creosote. Creosote treatment showed a negative effect on shear strength and delamination, more severe in the nonstructural than the structural GLT specimens tested. Full penetration of creosote into the sapwood was not achieved. GLT elements based on MUF adhesives can be considered an alternative to solid <b>wood</b> <b>sleepers</b> if specific grading of lamellas, proper treatment schedule, and highly controlled factory production are implemented...|$|E

40|$|The {{volatile}} {{composition of}} 20 -year-old out-of-service creosote-treated railway <b>wood</b> <b>sleepers</b> was studied. The emitted volatile fraction was collected {{by means of}} dynamic purge-and-trap concentration at ambient temperature, and analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) hyphenated with mass spectrometric detection systems, using quadrupole (GC × GC/qMS) and time-of-flight (GC × GC/ToF-MS) mass analyzers and selective nitrogen-phosphorus detection (GC × GC-NPD). The analysis of mass spectrometry data and GC × GC retention time allowed the tentative identification of about 300 compounds based on spectrometric data and positioning of each compound in the GC × GC plot. Major important headspace components are polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols and benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen atoms. Many of the reported compounds are listed as belonging to toxicological substance classes which have been related to harmful health effects. GC × GC provides greater speciation and evidence of composition heterogenicity of the sample than one-dimensional GC analysis, thus allowing to better demonstrate its potential toxicity. Data obtained by specific detection systems for N-heterocycles assisted mass data interpretation assignments. The enhanced separation power obtained after GC × GC compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC) together with spectral deconvolution and correlation with physical-chemical data, allowed the identification of complex isomer clusters, as demonstrated for alkylquinolines, and applied also to alkylphenols, alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes...|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} under History, Rechtenbach was a glassmaking centre. This craft blossomed {{particularly in}} the 17th century, when French glassblowers took over at the Rechtenbach glassworks. These craftsmen are recalled in the arms by the fleur-de-lis and the glassblower’s pipe. When the glassworks shut down for good in 1791, many villagers worked as <b>wood</b> hewers and <b>sleeper</b> sawyers while the railway was being built. This is represented in the arms by the beam hewer’s axe. The oakleaf stands for the community’s geographical location in the Spessart and also represents wood’s importance to the local economy.

50|$|Cleghorn saw {{the growth}} of the {{railways}} as being a major threat to the forests. He had seen a similar pattern in Scotland in the 1850s and he estimated, in the Madras Presidency, that a mile of rail line needed 1760 wooden sleepers which would have a life of eight years. In addition to the <b>sleepers,</b> <b>wood</b> was needed to run the steam engines of the railways apart from their use in steamships. By his estimate, {{there was no way to}} maintain the supply without destroying the forests unless some special management was undertaken. He pointed out that Britain was in a better state because of the reserves of coal and the ability to import wood from other parts of its Empire.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{exploitation}} of wastewood with Greek lignite was investigated by performing tests in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor, a 1 -MW th semi-industrial circulating fluidized bed combustor, and an industrial boiler. Blends of natural wood, demolition <b>wood,</b> railroad <b>sleepers,</b> medium-density fiberboard residues, and power poles with lignite were used, and the co-combustion efficiency {{and the effect}} of wastewood addition on the emitted pollutants were investigated. Carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions were continuously monitored, and, during the industrial-scale tests, the toxic emissions (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans and heavy metals) were determined. Ash samples were analyzed for heavy metals in an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy spectrophotometer. Problems were observed during the preparation of wastewood, because species embedded with different compounds, such as railway <b>sleepers</b> and demolition <b>wood,</b> were not easily treated. All wastewood blends were proven good fuels; co-combustion proceeded smoothly and homogeneous temperature and pressure profiles were obtained. Although some fluctuations were observed, low emissions of gaseous pollutants were obtained for all fuel blends. The metal element emissions (in the flue gases and the solid residues) were lower than the legislative limits. Therefore, wastewood co-combustion with lignite can be realized, provided that the fuel handling and preparation can be practically performed in large-scale installations...|$|R

Much of the line was in the process of being ballasted, and the kyanising of sleepers for the track had begun. Of the main building works only the contracts for station houses remained to be awarded.The Ouse bridge was required by the 1836 Act to have an opening arch of 44 ft, whilst the Ouse at Selby was nearly 200 ft in width, with an underlying geology consisting of silt, quicksand and then hard clay. The bridge consisted of two main spans, one opening; plus sections on either side from land to the first pier and to the second pier, and a section across the central piers. Each span consisted of six [...] cast iron longitudinal ribs, with one rib under the line of each rail and two outer ribs on either side under a handrail.

Located in the 8000 year old oak <b>wood</b> Tycanol, Pembrokeshire, <b>sleepers</b> is an {{expansion}} {{and development of}} an earlier event and exhibition with Old Museum Arts Centre, Belfast (2002). Jones' exhibition Liminal (2000) (www. recirca. com/backissues/c 93 /belfast. shtml) indicates previous engagement with similar themes and the paper 'Between a Flashing Star and a Gravestone: sleepers, liminality and communal dreaming' 2004 on the AHRC funded website 'Imaginal Regions' (www. imaginalregions. co. uk) defines the academic research context for sleepers. The concept developed out of Jones' research and current investigations into liminal states and was prompted {{by a desire to}} reclaim the reclining body from a surveyed, passive, feminised and objectified position by characterising the sleeper in an active role as the one who dreams the world into being and who lies dormant, full of potential. 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' are mediaeval romances focusing on the theme of ideal love, but their origins are in earlier folklore where the sleeper, who can be male or female, is a being that embodies the land and acts as its protector or guardian. By inviting people to become a sleeper, Jones provoked a shift in perspective from the sleeper as object to the sleeper as subject with multiple possibilities for becoming.

5000|$|In March 1889, Fourcade {{left for}} Natal on his own, with {{a mandate to}} report on the {{condition}} of the indigenous forests on Crown or Trust lands; to advise on the feasibility of creating artificial forests and {{to report on the}} supply of timber for use by the railways. Upon arrival at Durban, he was met by the botanist John Medley Wood, who provided him with his analytical key of Natal plants, Colonel Bowker, a keen naturalist and writer, and Richard Vause, co-founder of the Natal Mercury paper and also past Mayor of Durban - all waiting in person. This may well have been the most harmonious period in Fourcade's life. It was certainly the highlight of his career as a forestry officer. He was welcomed by the Natal Government, given transport and made a member of several clubs, introduced to all the magistrates of the districts included in his brief and had the railway workshops at his disposal. He was free to employ his skills and knowledge without hindrance from anyone and quickly demonstrated an immense capacity for hard work. The work included inspecting each forest's climate, average altitude, area and extent, soils, rock, tree species and surface growth. He had to assess the extent of damage by exploitation, fire or sapling depletion (by local hut builders or herders with grazing animals). The quality of the prose in the report shows that he was passionate {{about the state of the}} forests. He reconstructed how particular sequences of events had to have happened for forests to be in the state he found them. He took nearly 300 specimens of wood from about 70 species of trees for testing. The Report on the Natal Forests, which was published on 3 December 1889, towers over both the previous and later reports by other authors. It discusses the Natal forests, their utility and protection, management as well as plantations, and organisation of staff and works. It contains a list of 167 species of tree indigenous to Natal; mechanical constants determined by experiment of the hardness, density, elasticity coefficient, elasticity limit, breaking stress; notes on the preparation of <b>wood</b> and railway <b>sleeper</b> manufacture, a list of trees with high bark tannin content, measurements of rates of growth for indigenous trees, timber measurements, recommendations for vegetation from other countries that would be suitable for acclimatisation in Natal as forest vegetation, the altitude ranges at which some 91 species of exotic tree were found, statistics of timber imports for the decade 1880 to 1889 as well as a short extract on 'diminished rainfall' that the Governor had requested, concerning the theory that there might be a link between sunspots and rainfall. All the work was done in 10 months. Fourcade was 24 years old. The report was tabled in Parliament to an enthusiastic response: Of all the official documents that have been presented to the Legislative Council this session, by far the most interesting is the [...] "Report of the Natal Forests" [...] by Mr. H. G. Fourcade of the Cape Service, who was appointed early last year to perform the work of which this report is the representation and the result .... No one who reads this report will or can doubt his complete competency for the task committed to him. He has produced a monograph of immediate utility, absorbing interest, of abiding value. We have read the 95 pages of the report with unflagging attention, and benefit; and that is more than might be said of most Blue-books. These pages are pregnant with instructive and suggestive matter that it is impossible to take more than a cursory survey of them in this column. To be appreciated and understood, as it deserves to be, the whole report must be read. Storrar 1990, p. 38 Almost all his recommendations were adopted: The appointment of a conservator of forests was approved; a proclamation protected ironwood, stinkwood and yellowwoods; and the forests were shut down for 16 months. Fourcade was offered the new post, but he turned it down and returned to Cape Town. A year later, the report was still in the news, being regarded as the only Government publication that was ever seen to have been taken [...] "on a railway journey to relieve the monotony of travel on the Natal line" [...] (Storrar 1990, p. 39, quoting from the Natal Witness).|$|R
