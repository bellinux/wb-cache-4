Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative <b>worry,</b> <b>the</b> core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E

With the additional funds bequeathed from Queen's first major benefactor, Robert Sutherland, the college staved off financial failure and maintained its independence. Queen's was given university status on 17 May 1881. In 1883, Women's Medical College was founded at Queen's with a class of three. Theological Hall, completed in 1880, originally served as Queen's main building throughout the late 19th century.|$|E

He becomes unnerved when Charles Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, exhibits a no-nonsense attitude towards him, making Michael not feel like his own boss. Charles seems to establish {{a good relationship with}} the rest of the staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to <b>worry</b> <b>the</b> staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. When Charles catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during office hours, he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party. Michael decides to drive to New York to talk to Wallace.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the story}} {{involves}} Madoc returning to Wales to recruit more settlers for his colony. During this time, he meets with Owen Cyveilioc, a poet who tells Madoc to discuss the matter with the Congress of Bards. During the meeting, a young bard prophesies that Madoc would be like Merlin in America and that he is trying to recreate an Arthurian greatness. Afterward, he meets with Llewelyn, an individual trying to reclaim his title as Prince of Wales. Madoc tries and fails to convince him to come to America. Madoc returns to his original home, and there he stops an attempt to remove the body of Gwynned from a grave on holy ground. Instead, Madoc offers to take the corpse back with him to America where it could be buried without any <b>worry.</b> <b>The</b> rest of Madoc's time back in Wales is spent trying to get his brother David, the king, to free another brother, Rodri, whom he has imprisoned. However, Rodri escapes after his release was promised. As Madoc sets out to return to the colony, they are met by Rodri's boat. Rodri informs Madoc that he is working with Llewelyn to overthrow David and restore the rightful king. Although Madoc is upset by the potential warfare, he leaves with the promise by Llewlyn that Britain will be fine.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for <b>worry.</b> <b>The</b> ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the content, frequency {{and distribution of}} worries among primary school children in Somanya, Ghana. In part one, 85 primary school children aged between 10 -to- 15 years listed their worries through a list generation technique and a focus group discussion. In part two, <b>the</b> <b>worries</b> generated by <b>the</b> children were categorized and a questionnaire was constructed for measuring frequency of typical worries. 120 primary school children of same age range ranked {{the frequency with which}} they <b>worried.</b> <b>The</b> list generation described the content of <b>the</b> children’s <b>worries,</b> and were grouped under six main categories respecting the child’s life namely, ‘Personal care’; ‘Education’; ‘Breaking norms’; ‘Family relationships’; ‘Safety and Environment’; and ‘Sickness and death’. The children’s responses to the frequency scale indicated that their topmost worries related to ‘Care’. The study documented gender and age difference in <b>worries.</b> <b>The</b> girls in this study listed more <b>worries</b> than <b>the</b> boys. Younger participants (10 - 12 year olds) listed more worries than older ones (13 - 15 year olds). However, statistical analysis did not reveal an overall gender and age differences in frequency of <b>worrying.</b> <b>The</b> children also indicated that they talked more to adults (parents, teachers and other adults in their families) about their <b>worries.</b> <b>The</b> thematic content of worries revealed systematic differences between orphaned and non-orphaned children. Orphaned children related more <b>worries</b> on <b>the</b> well-being of their current caregivers, sickness and death of parents. Their worries also demonstrated problems of adjusting into their new families. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the child’s sense of secure base. The role of parent/caregivers as moderators and mediators of important issues and life experiences have been emphasised...|$|R

As the demand for manufacturing grows, it in turn will help in the creation of jobs, investments, and innovations.|$|E

500|$|It quickly gained support {{within the}} LCL's membership, {{capturing}} {{a number of}} party branches and began preselecting its own members. Robin Millhouse {{was a member of}} the faction, and served as both the deputy leader of the LCL and the LM. Thanks to the electoral reform that had occurred, with more urban electoral districts to contest, the urban-based LM greatly increased its parliamentary representation, with seven members in the House of Assembly (including Hall, Millhouse and future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown), three in the Legislative Council, and one in the Australian House of Representatives (Ian Wilson). Soon there were factional clashes during parliamentary debate, combative television debates, and some LCL members began campaigning anonymously against the LCL. One LCL branch president publicly called Hall a [...] "traitor". The LM managed to <b>worry</b> <b>the</b> conservatives by managing to seize control of some rural branches within electorates held by strongly anti-LM representatives, including that of De Garis. The conservatives tried to remove Hall's endorsement for his seat, but failed. Several bitterly fought pre-selection battles followed.

Halcombe went on to bowl two overs without incident in the second innings of the match as Tasmania ended at 1/42 when time ran out. Much anticipation surrounded his return to his home town of Adelaide the following week for a match against South Australia, {{with one of the}} umpires being Hele. Halcombe spoke in an interview to Adelaide's Advertiser in which he declared that he was adamant that his bowling was [...] "quite legal". Halcombe asserted that only one of the eight deliveries that he bowled under a slow motion camera could be considered to be of a doubtful nature. Halcombe again passed Hele's scrutiny unscathed, but his bowling failed to <b>worry</b> <b>the</b> South Australians, who plundered 100 runs from 13 overs for the loss of only one wicket. To make things worse, Halcombe made a pair as his team crashed to defeat by an innings and 234 runs. Debate over the legality of his action continued during the season, with former umpire Bob Crockett supporting his no-balling while former Test captain Joe Darling disagreed. Halcombe was the first player in top-class cricket in Australia to be called for throwing by three different umpires.|$|E
500|$|While fanciers {{sought to}} {{identify}} and standardize the breed and its description through the late 19th century, the Scottish Terrier was known by many different names: the Highland, the Cairn, Diehard, and most often, the Aberdeen Terrier—named because of the abundant number of the dogs {{in the area and}} because a J. A. Adamson of Aberdeen successfully exhibited his dogs during the 1870s. Roger Rough, a dog owned by Adamson, Tartan, a dog owned by Mr Paynton Piggott, Bon Accord, owned by Messrs Ludlow and Bromfield, and Splinter II owned by Mr Ludlow, were early winners of dog exhibitions and are the four dogs from which all Scottish Terrier pedigrees ultimately began. It is often said that all present day Scotties stem from a single , Splinter II, and two sires. In her book, The New Scottish Terrier, Cindy Cooke refers to Splinter II as the [...] "foundation matron of the modern Scottish Terrier." [...] Cooke goes on to say [...] "For whatever reason, early breeders line bred on this bitch to the virtual exclusion of all others. Mated to Tartan, she produced <b>Worry,</b> <b>the</b> dam of four champions. Rambler, her son by Bonaccord, sired the two founding sires of the breed, Ch. Dundee (out of Worry) and Ch.

500|$|John {{treated the}} interdict as [...] "the {{equivalent}} of a papal declaration of war". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to {{drive a wedge between}} those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to greatly <b>worry</b> <b>the</b> king. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to £66,666 at the time) to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year.|$|E
