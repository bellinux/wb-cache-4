40|$|Instead {{of merely}} setting a lower bound on {{the wages of}} formal sector workers, minimum wages serve as a norm for wage setting more {{generally}} throughout the Mexican economy. Our results suggest that wages are commonly set at multiples of the minimum wage, and that changes in minimum wages influence wage changes across the occupational distribution. Moreover, {{our findings suggest that}} these normative features of minimum wages have their greatest impact on the mid-to-lower tail of the wage distribution, including the informal sector of the economy. Thus, the results lend support to the view that declining real minimum <b>wages</b> and <b>stabilization</b> programs that strengthened the link between wage levels, wage changes, and minimum wages, might account for a portion of the growing wage inequality in Mexico over the period of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the performance of the Venezuelan labor market between 1982 and 1995, and to analyze its impact on the evolution of poverty. This time period is one wherein Venezuela suffered from the consequences of both changes in the international financial market conditions, and a sustained deterioration of economic management. Growth and inflation were highly volatile, real wages fell in a sustained way, and poverty increased dramatically. The authors develop the idea that the main labor problem in Venezuela was the decrease is falling real wages, not unemployment, and explore the labor market through the use of conceptual framework derived from segmented labor market models such as the Harris-Todaro model.

25|$|Unions {{felt that}} during World War II the National War Labor Board had unfairly held wages {{below the level}} of {{inflation}} while doing little to rein in corporate profits. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) as well as independent labor unions were determined to avoid a similar outcome under the new <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board. On December 20, 1950, a United Labor Policy Committee (ULPC) composed of representatives of the AFL, CIO, the Railway Labor Executives' Association (a group of railway labor unions) and the International Association of Machinists formed to influence the WSB's deliberations on <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> policy. The group demanded a yearly cost-of-living adjustment for all contracts, productivity pay increases linked to company profit margins, and price controls. But the WSB's public and corporate representatives were in agreement that the board should only focus on wages, and strictly control wages to keep inflation in check.|$|E

40|$|During the {{transition}} from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, many countries seem to have experienced some degree of macroeconomic instability. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. The paper develops a simple monetary model and shows how macroeconomic stability can be achieved in a rigid centrally planned economy, despite the inherent structural imbalances and irrational price system. On the other hand, the study shows that without hardening enterprise budget constraints, wage and price decontrol tends to destablize the economy and may lead to persistent budget deficits and inflation. The paper also provides a rigorous analysis of household savings and money demand in a shortage economy, and clarifies the somewhat confusing concept of “monetary overhang” in the literature.

40|$|We {{examine the}} variance-covariance {{structure}} of log-wages {{over time and}} over the lifecycle of British men from 1975 to 2001, hereby controlling for cohort effects. Wage inequality has risen sharply during the 1980 ?s and early 1990 ?s and remained fairly constant {{in the second half}} of the 1990 ?s. We show that this increase is caused mainly by a strong increase in the transitory wage inequality and only to a lesser extent to an increase in the permanent wage inequality. The transitory component of wages is, however, highly persistent over time: serial correlation decreases from 0. 88 over a one-year period to 0. 65 over a ten-year period. The constant wage inequality {{in the second half of}} the 1990 ?s is attributed to a slight decrease in permanent <b>wages</b> inequality, a <b>stabilization</b> of the variance of the transitory wage shock, and the strong decrease in the transitory wage inequality for the cohorts entering employment since the end of the 1980 ?s. Ignoring age effects in transitory wage inequality and cohort effects, as is commonly done, leads to severely distorted inferences concerning the changes in permanent wage inequality...|$|R
25|$|Labor representatives {{believed}} that wage controls were particularly unfair to some workers. Some workers had received very high wage increases in 1950 {{prior to the}} imposition of wage controls, while others had yet to negotiate contracts or receive wage increases. Labor representatives demanded a 12 percent wage increase for workers {{who had not yet}} negotiated contracts under the <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> policy, but the public and corporate members of the board held to a 10 percent increase.|$|E
25|$|President Truman {{referred}} {{the wage}} dispute to ODM's <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board (WSB). In March 1952, the WSB recommended a 16.5-cent-an-hour wage increase. The steelmakers lobbied Congress, DOD and defense manufacturers, opposing any wage increase {{unless there was}} an accompanying price increase. The pressure led Congress to threaten to overturn any WSB wage increase. Republicans demanded that the president invoke the Taft-Hartley Act and force the steelworkers back to work. But Truman, needing labor's support in the 1952 presidential campaign, refused to do so.|$|E
25|$|President Truman {{chose not}} to impose price controls, as the federal {{government}} had done during World War II. Instead, the administration attempted to avoid inflationary pressures through creation of a <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board that sought to keep down the inflation of consumer prices and wages while avoiding labor disputes whenever possible. Those efforts failed, however, to avoid a threatened strike of all of the major steel producers by the United Steel Workers of America when the steel industry rejected the board's proposed wage increases unless they were allowed greater price increases than the government was prepared to approve.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, Aaron {{served as a}} conciliator with the United States Conciliation Service and helped settle a number of labor disputes—particularly in California's aircraft industry during the post-war wave of strikes. President Harry S. Truman appointed {{him to be a}} public member of the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board on July 5, 1951. He was a strong critic of the Board's case-by-case method of awarding pay increases. During the 1952 steel strike, he played a role as a go-between for the United Steelworkers of America and the Board. President Truman appointed him vice chairman of the Board on May 29, 1952. Aaron was deeply critical of congressional efforts to cut the Board's budget, and declared that Congress should either fully fund the Board's activities or have the courage to legislate the Board out of existence.|$|E
25|$|The steel crisis {{issue was}} {{now out of}} Putnam's hands. In Executive Order 10233, President Truman had {{expanded}} the WSB's powers in April 1951. To ease the threat of strikes and make the Board's <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> efforts easier, the Board was now authorized to make recommendations on economic and non-economic issues in collective bargaining disputes—a power it had previously lacked. The Board could not, however, force parties in a labor dispute to accept its findings. When making recommendations, the Board was authorized to report only to the president—bypassing Putnam and his superior, Charles Edward Wilson, administrator of the Office of Defense Mobilization (of which ESA was a part). As one incentive to get the union to postpone the strike, Truman agreed to let the WSB investigate the labor dispute and invoke the direct presidential reporting provisions of E.O. 10233.|$|E
25|$|When the Board {{issued its}} {{recommendations}} on March 20, 1952, it triggered a crisis {{which led to}} seizure of the nation's steel mills. The decision to give the workers a 26 cent-an-hour raise (which included bringing their pensions to parity with workers in other industries) was largely seen as an overly-generous award {{as well as a}} union victory. Although he had been bypassed by the procedures of E.O. 10233, Wilson decided to intervene in the dispute to avoid having the terms of the recommendation accepted. He met with Putnam and Arnall on March 21 and informed them he would be involved in the steel industry labor dispute personally. Wilson then traveled to Key West, Florida, to meet with a vacationing Truman. Believing he had won Truman's consent to reduce the wage recommendation, Wilson subsequently denounced the WSB recommendation and sponsored a number of collective bargaining sessions between the parties over the next few days. An angry Putnam and his deputies met with Wilson on March 27. Wilson Putnam, and his deputies then met with the president on March 28, at which time Putnam told Truman that the WSB recommendations met <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> goals and that Wilson's actions were inappropriate. Truman agreed; Wilson resigned. John R. Steelman, Assistant to the President of the United States (a position which later became the White House Chief of Staff), was named interim director of the Office of Defense Mobilization on March 30. Negotiations between Steelman's staff, employers and the union unraveled over the next seven days, and the union announced it would strike on April 9. In a nationally televised address at 10:30p.m. Eastern time on April 8, President Truman announced that he was seizing the nation's steel mills under his authority as commander-in-chief. The steelmakers sued to regain control of their property.|$|E
2500|$|Organized labor {{believed}} it was being frozen out of <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> decision-making, and that political and economic pressure on Truman would push the president to establish a broad wage freeze. The <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board assembled the steel wage panel on January 3, and opened hearings on Monday, January 7. Although economic stabilization officials {{were excluded from the}} panel's proceedings under E.O. 10233, they nevertheless attempted to influence the panel's deliberations. [...] The day before the panel's hearings opened, Putnam announced ESA would seek a better wage formula than that contained in Wage Regulation 6. Ten days later, Feinsinger announced that a wage regulation rewrite would be undertaken as quickly as possible.|$|E

2500|$|The strike led Congress {{to strip}} the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board of its labor dispute {{resolution}} powers.

2500|$|On September 9, Truman issued Executive Order 10161, which {{established}} the Economic Stabilization Agency (ESA) to coordinate and supervise wage and price controls. Utilizing the wage and price control model developed in World War II, the Truman administration created two sub-agencies within ESA. [...] The Office of Price Stabilization (OPS) {{was given the}} power to regulate prices, while the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board (WSB) oversaw the creation of <b>wage</b> <b>stabilization</b> rules. The division of labor was specifically designed to unlink wages from prices. If prices rose automatically with wages, the inflationary spiral would continue unabated. Placing the onus solely on workers to keep wages low risked the wrath of labor, a lesson the administration had learned from the World War II experience. Delinking wages and prices leveled the playing field. Both workers and employers would now be forced to justify, independently, the wages and prices they demanded.|$|E
2500|$|The steel wage panel {{concluded}} its {{hearings on}} February 16, 1951. [...] The issues proved so numerous and complex, however, that the panel advised the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board {{that it needed}} until March 13 to complete its report. [...] The union was asked to extend its strike deadline. Despite Murray's accusation that the government intended to provoke a strike, the union gave the WSB until March 20 to issue its wage ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Tensions also {{ruptured}} labor's {{united front}} on the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board. [...] The ULPC dissolved on August 14 when the AFL {{pulled out of}} the joint committee.

By October, organized labor's influence throughout the defense mobilization bureaucracy had significantly waned.|$|E
2500|$|A second labor wage dispute crisis hit in October 1952. [...] Bituminous {{coal miners}} {{organized}} by the United Mine Workers of America had negotiated a wage increase of $1.90 per hour but no increase in fringe benefits (as other unions had). Without union knowledge, the coal operators submitted the agreement for approval to the reconstituted <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board. Mine union president John L. Lewis, angered {{by the lack of}} respect, refused to participate in the WSB's hearings despite Cox's pleas for union input. Reluctantly, on October 18 the Board cut the wage increase by 40 cents. Angry union coal miners engaged in a nationwide wildcat strike the next day. [...] With the presidential election just weeks away, Lewis asked Putnam to take personal control of the coal miners' case on October 24, and Putnam did so on October 25. The strike ended. Putnam deferred action until after the election. When Lewis balked at further delay, Putnam threatened to rule against the union. Although Putnam, Cox and other stabilization and mobilization officials all eventually endorsed the lower pay award, Truman reversed the WSB on December 3. Cox and industry representatives on the WSB resigned in protest. The decision led to the collapse of the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board, and it quickly became clear that neither President Truman nor President-elect Dwight Eisenhower would seek to retain national wage and price controls.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 1950, the RLEA {{joined with}} the AFL, CIO, International Association of Machinists to form the United Labor Policy Committee. The committee's goal was to monitor {{government}} policy-making to avoid what labor unions perceived was a pro-business policy bias in during World War II. During the economic crisis which occurred during the Korean War, the United Labor Policy Committee oversaw the labor representatives on the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board (WSB), which regulated wages in the defense industry in the United States. [...] During the buildup to the 1952 steel strike, the WSB imposed nationwide wage controls on January 26, 1951. Labor representatives on the board, who opposed wholesale wage controls, were outvoted nine to three. On February 16, the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board issued Wage Regulation 6 which permitted a 10 percent increase in wages for those workers who had not negotiated a wage increase {{in the last six}} months. The regulation was based on the [...] "Little Steel formula" [...] of World War II. At the instruction of the RLEA {{and other members of the}} United Labor Policy Committee, the labor representatives on the WSB resigned in protest. Unwilling to alienate labor by imposing wage controls involuntarily, President Truman reconstituted the WSB with a greatly enlarged membership and powers and new authority to report directly to the president.|$|E
2500|$|Defense {{mobilization}} chief Charles Wilson, however, {{determined to}} upend the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board's recommendations. [...] Wilson was convinced by Truman's remarks at the Key West {{press conference that}} the president would reject the Board's report. On March 21, Wilson met with steel industry officials to learn their views. On March 22, he consulted with Putnam and Arnall. [...] On March 23, Wilson flew to Key West to speak with the president. The two men met the next morning. Wilson flew back to Washington that afternoon, convinced he had won Truman's consent to settle the steel wage dispute at a level two-thirds lower than the recommendation of the WSB.|$|E
2500|$|The Steelworkers {{indicated}} on September 22 {{that they would}} seek an industry-wide rather than company-by-company approach to the upcoming wage negotiations. [...] Union leaders argued that employers would never voluntarily agree to a collective bargaining agreement because {{there would be no}} guarantee that a concomitant price increase would occur. Murray told the press that he assumed the wage dispute would end {{up in the hands of}} the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board, and the union was actively working to convince the WSB to alter its pay regulations to permit a pay increase in the 10 to 15 cents an hour range rather than the permissible 4 cents an hour. The consensus was that the WSB would permit steelworkers' wages to rise rather than risk a strike.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1951, the AFHWA re-affiliated {{with the}} American Federation of Labor. [...] On April 30, 1952, TWUA delegates re-elected Rieve as {{president}} of the union. The vote was 1,223 to 720, although most observers claimed this was a startlingly close election given Rieve's near-total control over the union. The convention was a contentious one. Delegates engaged in heated debate, with many exchanges devolving into shouting matches. Rieve was forced to alter a number of his policy decisions in order to win delegate support. On {{the last day of the}} convention, Rieve fulfilled one such pledge by announcing that he was resigning from the <b>Wage</b> <b>Stabilization</b> Board in the midst of a major dispute over steelworker wages in order to devote more time to union business and less to government and other duties.|$|E
