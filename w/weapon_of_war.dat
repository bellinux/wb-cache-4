5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|The term 'bomber mafia' {{came from}} the {{sometimes}} bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> and that a separate air arm was required to command them. For the first few years, the strongest voice at ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain (later General) George C. Kenney who called {{for the use of}} air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.|$|E

5|$|Returning to {{the surface}} with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, {{intending}} to bring the crystal {{to the surface}} and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds its location for himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat before merging with Kida. Rourke and the mercenaries lock Kida in a crate and prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates his friends for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and provides power, protection, and longevity in return. It will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted {{to use it as a}} <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Encouraged by Sweet, Milo rallies the crew, and the Atlanteans to stop Rourke.|$|E

25|$|The scholar Peter Custers {{points out}} that the Indian army’s oppression was far more {{overwhelming}} than the repression committed by Hyderabad's former Nizams (rulers) who had employed militias called Razakars to repress Hyderabad's Hindu population. Peter Custer also notes that the Indian Army used rape far more extensively as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> than the Razakars did. Peter Custers states that thousands of Indian soldiers would converge upon villages and gang-rape women. Mass rape was a characteristic of every village where Indian military camps were present.|$|E

25|$|Violence {{during the}} Rwandan Genocide of 1994 took a gender-specific form when, {{over the course}} of 100 days, up to half a million women were raped, sexually mutilated, or murdered. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) handed down the first {{conviction}} for the use of rape as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> during the civil conflict, and, because the intent of the mass violence against Rwandan women was to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular ethnic group, {{it was the first time}} that mass rape during wartime was found to be an act of genocidal rape.|$|E

Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200km² of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up. The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages.|$|E

At that time, the warring powers in Europe were still uncertain about the role which their awkward flying machines would play on the field of war.

25|$|According to a {{study by}} Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 220,000 people have died in the {{conflict}} between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 – 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The report shows that the humanitarian crisis in Colombia is extremely serious in terms of both lethal and nonlethal violence. The report examines the widespread use of sexual violence against women and girls as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> as well as the invisibility of this phenomenon. 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war.|$|E
25|$|During the Kosovo War {{thousands}} of Kosovo Albanian {{women and girls}} became victims of sexual violence. War rape {{was used as a}} <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> and an instrument of systematic ethnic cleansing; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a 2000 Human Rights Watch report war rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women's homes, rapes during fighting, and rapes in detention. The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but they also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Most rapes were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{genocide}} had {{a lasting}} and {{profound impact on}} Rwanda and its neighboring countries. The pervasive use of rape as a <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> caused a spike in HIV infection, including babies born of rape to newly infected mothers; many households were headed by orphaned children or widows. The destruction of infrastructure and the severe depopulation of the country crippled the economy, challenging the nascent government to achieve rapid economic growth and stabilization. The RPF military victory and installation of an RPF-dominated government prompted many Hutus to flee to neighboring countries, particularly in the eastern portion of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), where the Hutu genocidaires began to regroup in refugee camps {{along the border with}} Rwanda. Declaring a need to avert further genocide, the RPF-led government led military incursions into Zaire, including the First (1996–97) and Second (1998–2003) Congo Wars. Armed struggles between the Rwandan government and their opponents in DRC have continued to play out through proxy militias in the Goma region, including the M23 rebellion (2012–2013). Large Rwandan Hutu and Tutsi populations continue to live as refugees throughout the region.|$|E
