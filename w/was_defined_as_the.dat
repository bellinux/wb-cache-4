5|$|Route 37 <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} Winchester By-Pass by 1963, and {{was included}} in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past Winchester in November 1965, it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road. The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of Winchester north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the Winchester Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic {{at the north end of}} the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E

40|$|This chapter reviews {{measures}} of emergence, self-organization, complexity, home-ostasis, and autopoiesis {{based on information}} theory. These measures are derived from proposed axioms and tested in two case studies: random Boolean networks and an Arctic lake ecosystem.

Self-organization <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> opposite of emergence, while complexity <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> balance be-tween emergence and self-organization. Homeostasis reflects the stability of a system. Autopoiesis <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ratio between the complexity of a system and the com-plexity of its environment. The proposed measures can be applied at different scales, which can be studied with multi-scale profiles. ...|$|R

25|$|In modern phylogeny, clades {{are defined}} that contain all species forming a certain {{branch of the}} {{evolutionary}} tree. This also allows one to clearly indicate all relationships between the several subgroups in a cladogram. In 1999, a node clade Ichthyopterygia was defined by Motani as the group consisting of the last common ancestor of Ichthyosaurus communis, Utatsusaurus hataii and Parvinatator wapitiensis; and all its descendants. Within Motani's phylogeny, the Ichthyopterygia were the larger parent clade of a smaller stem clade Ichthyosauria that <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> group consisting of Ichthyosaurus communis and all species {{more closely related to}} Ichthyosaurus than to Grippia longirostris. Motani's concept of the Ichthyosauria was thus more limited than the traditional one that also contained basal forms, such as Grippia, Utatsusaurus, and Parvinatator.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} {{congestion pricing}} zone <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> island of Manhattan, bordered by the East and Hudson Rivers south of 60th Street.

Exempted roadways within the zone include the FDR Drive, New York Route 9A (West Side Highway and Henry Hudson Parkway included), the Battery Park Underpass, and the East River bridges (Queensboro Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge) and their approaches. A free route from the East River bridges to the FDR Drive and from the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels to Route 9A would be designated. Drivers who use toll crossings to or from the zone (e.g. Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Queens-Midtown Tunnel) would be charged {{the difference between the}} toll and the congestion charge.|$|E
25|$|Planck (1906a) {{defined the}} {{relativistic}} momentum {{and gave the}} correct values for the longitudinal and transverse mass by correcting a slight mistake of the expression given by Einstein in 1905. Planck's expressions were in principle equivalent to those used by Lorentz in 1899. Based {{on the work of}} Planck, the concept of relativistic mass was developed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard C. Tolman (1908, 1909) by defining mass as the ratio of momentum to velocity. So the older definition of longitudinal and transverse mass, in which mass <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ratio of force to acceleration, became superfluous. Finally, Tolman (1912) interpreted relativistic mass simply as the mass of the body. However, many modern textbooks on relativity don't use the concept of relativistic mass anymore, and mass in special relativity is considered as an invariant quantity.|$|E

25|$|Hof et al.

The optimal target <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> concentration that would result in the lowest reduction in the present value (i.e., discounted) of global consumption. A set of assumptions that included a relatively high climate sensitivity (i.e., a relatively large global temperature increase for a given increase in GHGs), high damages, a long time horizon, low discount rates (i.e., future consumption is valued relatively highly), and low mitigation costs, produced an optimum peak in the concentration of CO2e at 540 parts per million (ppm). Another set of assumptions that assumed a lower climate sensitivity (lower global temperature increase), lower damages, a shorter time horizon, and a higher discount rate (present consumption is valued relatively more highly), produced an optimum peaking at 750ppm.|$|E
25|$|Expansionist {{competition}} {{into the}} region began in the 18th century, with participants including the Russian Empire, the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States. By the 1820s, both the Russians, through the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825, and the Spanish, by the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, formally withdrew their territorial claims in the region. Through these treaties the British and Americans gained residual territorial claims in the disputed area.

25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E
