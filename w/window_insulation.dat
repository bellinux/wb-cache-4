5000|$|In 1931, Hyde {{became the}} first organic chemist to accept a {{position}} at Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated). He was hired to investigate the new plastics that challenged the glass industry. Hyde had studied Kipping and Ladenburg’s {{work in the field}} of organic silicon chemistry and sought to find a flexible, high temperature binder for the glass fibers that would allow for an increase in service temperature for insulating materials. He followed Kipping’s procedure for creating organic silicon compounds by using Grignard’s magnesium-containing reagent and eventually synthesized a fluid that hardened to a rubbery mass. This new composite {{was one of the first}} Class H insulators and made it possible for Corning to produce high temperature motors and generators. [...] This silicone was used in ships and planes during World War II, as cable and wire insulation, in aeronautical equipment, and in <b>window</b> <b>insulation.</b> Future versions of this silicone would be used in breast implants and in prosthetic heart valves.|$|E
5000|$|Insulation of a {{sustainable}} home {{is important because}} of the energy it conserves throughout {{the life of the}} home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home. [...] Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out. Low-emissivity or Low-E glass is another option for <b>window</b> <b>insulation.</b> It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. “Superwindows,” mentioned in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this essay is about a single-family house that we have planned and projected. The second part is a deeper study in ways to further {{insulate}} windows when they are not in use. In the first part the building’s design and its most important construction elements are described. The planning of all major installations (heating, domestic water, ventilation, sanitation, electricity) are reported so that one can in principle start construction of the house. In addition there are calculations done on the building’s energy management. The result is a two stored house angled toward the south. The ground floor has a spacious kitchen and living room in an open floor plan, while the upper floor has more separated bedrooms. The house gets its heat from a geothermal heat pump and is very well insulated. This makes the house energy efficient and it easily meets Boverket’s requirements regarding energy consumption. The second part of the work is a deeper study dealing with <b>window</b> <b>insulation.</b> With <b>window</b> <b>insulation</b> is meant removable and insulating constructions that are in use for instance on nights, but can be removed when the windows are needed for daylight and view. The effect on the energy loss through windows with different systems of <b>window</b> <b>insulation</b> is examined. We conclude that there is money to be saved with such designs. Perhaps most interesting is that our energy calculations show that even with simple types of <b>window</b> <b>insulation,</b> such as blinds and curtains, a lot of energy can be saved. Such simple systems has, in our opinion, the greatest potential for the future since they are relatively inexpensive and do not impact the building’s façade much...|$|E
40|$|The <b>window</b> <b>insulation</b> always {{plays an}} {{important}} role in building design and thermal comfort, it is one of the main parts needed to be optimized in building envelop. <b>Window</b> <b>insulation</b> is a basic element which can decide the insulation capacity. The large heat loss from the window is the main part of wasting energy, and simultaneously, there is also difficult to explore the new energy source and to improve the current heat generation device efficiency in this energy crisis century. Therefore, building a proper insulated window system is a good approach to keep an acceptable indoor climate as well as to reduce energy use and negative climate effects. On the other hand, there are amounts of old houses and poorly design houses all over the world either in a well developed country or a developing country. Therefore it can form a better atmosphere to optimize the window worldwide. The aim of the thesis is telling the reader what kind of optimization can be done to get better <b>window</b> <b>insulation.</b> This thesis starts with a briefly introduction to give the basic knowledge of heat loss from windows, and then shows the heat loss level in comparison with other parts of building. Afterwards it gives the optimization strategy to make good window glazing and window frames. For frame design, the hollow frame material property and the benefits of insulants filling window system are described. There are still some problems which exist for the energy efficient windows, such as condensation problem. The thesis also shows this kind of problem and the solution approach...|$|E
40|$|During the {{performance}} of contract DE-FC 26 - 00 -NT 40998, entitled ''Affordable <b>Window</b> <b>Insulation</b> with R- 10 /inch Value'', research was conducted at Aspen Aerogels, Inc. to develop new transparent aerogel materials suitable for <b>window</b> <b>insulation</b> applications. The project requirements were to develop a formulation or multiple formulations that have high transparency (85 - 90 %) in the visible region, are hydrophobic (will not opacify with exposure to water vapor or liquid), and have at least 2 % resiliency (interpreted as recoverable 2 % strain and better than 5 % strain to failure in compression). Results from an unrelated project showed that silica aerogels covalently bonded to organic polymers exhibit excellent mechanical properties. At the outset of this project, we believed that such a route is the best to improve mechanical properties. We have applied Design of Experiment (DOE) techniques to optimize formulations including both silica aerogels and organically modified silica aerogels (''Ormosils''). We used these DOE results to optimize formulations around the local/global optimization points. This report documents that we succeeded in developing a number of formulations that meet all of the stated criteria. We successfully developed formulations utilizing a two-step approach where the first step involves acid catalyzed hydrolysis and the second step involves base catalyzed condensation to make the gels.

40|$|A {{building}} {{shall be}} classified as high performance building if it is energy efficient and durable {{and at the same}} time provides comfortable and healthy indoor environment for occupants. To achieve this objective, the hygrothermal performance of alternative building designs should be evaluated based on the simultaneous analysis of these three functional requirements rather than separately. In this article, a Whole-Building Hygrothermal model is used for evaluation of various retrofit design parameters that potentially enhance the overall performance of an existing residential house. The retrofit options considered in this study include changes to the reference house's ventilation rate and operation, <b>windows,</b> <b>insulation</b> level, and various combinations of these options. Energy efficiency, building envelope and moisture management potential, indoor humidity control, and window condensation potentials are considered to be the four performance indicators in searching for a retrofit option that delivers an optimal performance. The hygrothermal simulation results indicate that changing a design parameter to improve one of the design goals may result in less optimal results in the other one or both goals, or even in some cases result in severe negative consequences.
