500|$|Mark Lepage of Blender {{claimed that}} Is This It {{is similar to}} the works of 1970s bands the Velvet Underground, Television and the Feelies. Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber {{suggested}} that, while the work of the Velvet Underground is an obvious inspiration for the Strokes, the band's only similarity to the other groups is the confidence with which they perform. AllMusic's Heather Phares concluded, [...] "Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences... have 'critics' darlings' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> them. But like the similarly lauded Elastica and Supergrass before them, the Strokes don't rehash the sounds that inspire them—they remake them in their own image." ...|$|E

Beyoncé then echoes the word [...] "halo" [...] in the chorus; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum breakdown, and is complemented by sweeping strings and percussion.|$|E
500|$|Reception to Nebulous was {{generally}} positive: a reviewer from The Times described the first series as [...] "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it", {{while the second}} series was described as [...] "cool and cultish". However, The Daily Telegraph was more guarded, comparing the show to [...] "Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy", going {{on to say that}} show is [...] "funny, but not seriously so". A reviewer for Doctor Who website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed [...] "I should have been more patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".|$|E

Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands off me. [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode."

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep.

After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They make a mess in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it."

Popjustice compared it to [...] "Some Girls" [...] by Rachel Stevens and added [...] " [...] track lays a really strong foundation for the realised comeback that didn't quite happen last time and it's hard not {{to think of it as}} a late contender for single of the year. [...] It's literally quite good". Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald said [...] "it's got hit <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it".

500|$|Ronnie Gene Dunn {{was born}} June 1, 1953 in Coleman, Texas. He played bass guitar in local bands {{during high school}} and he briefly studied {{theology}} at Hardin-Simmons University {{with the intention of}} becoming a Baptist preacher. Dunn was [...] "kicked out" [...] of the school because he played in bars. Between 1983 and 1984, he recorded for the Churchill label, taking both [...] "It's <b>Written</b> <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> Your Face" [...] and [...] "She Put the Sad in All His Songs" [...] to number 59 on the country charts. In 1989, session drummer Jamie Oldaker entered Dunn in a talent contest sponsored by Marlboro, which he won. The grand prize in the competition included a recording session in Nashville. The producer of that session, Scott Hendricks, recommended Dunn's recordings to Tim DuBois, then an executive of Arista Nashville. DuBois paired Brooks and Dunn because he thought that they would work well together as songwriters, and after the two recorded a demo, he suggested that they form a duo. During this timespan, Dunn also wrote [...] "Boot Scootin' Boogie", which Asleep at the Wheel recorded on their 1990 album Keepin' Me Up Nights.|$|E
500|$|Kelsey Paine of Billboard {{called the}} song [...] "a love letter to DJs everywhere, with hand claps that build to a crescendo of pure, {{infectious}} dance-pop." [...] Paine, {{referring to her}} appearance on [...] "Right Round", wrote that she [...] "offers her own fun and frivolous ode to a wild night out" [...] as she sings about drinking and men. The review was concluded with the consensus the Kesha's debut [...] "reveals a knack for getting the party started." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News called the song [...] "a vintage lick of dance candy too tooth-rottingly sweet to resist" [...] that featured a [...] "stabbing synthesizer hook". Fraser McAlpine of the BBC, giving the single four {{out of a possible}} five stars, called it a [...] "dirty little ditty" [...] that had [...] "'hit' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it". McAlpine noted its similarities to Lady Gaga's [...] "Just Dance" [...] for their partying subject matter, but concedes that [...] "she does make it sound kinda fun though." [...] Billy Johnson, Jr. of Yahoo! compared [...] "Tik Tok" [...] to the 1980s L'Trimm hit [...] "Cars That Go Boom" [...] and notes that Kesha has [...] "take on L'Trimm's vocal styling for her own hit." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the record is a {{reference}} to the 1994 novel Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses, written by Billy Childish. A copy of the book had been dedicated to Minogue, but was accidentally passed onto Nick Cave, eventually given to Minogue not long after. She recalled only looking at the {{title of the}} book, and saying that [...] "It had me <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it." [...] Additionally, she believed that the poems in the book summarised where she was at that time in her life. Furthermore, the title was used in the album's song [...] "Dreams", during the chorus, [...] "These are the dreams of an impossible princess". Although copies of the album and its title were printed in mid-1997, on 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a fatal car accident. Due to impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's aforementioned titled was [...] "insensitive" [...] and the label delayed its release. Feeling the title would be inappropriate to have on the album, Minogue and her management came to a mutual agreement to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe, the same name as her 1994 record. However, upon the album's remastered and re-released edition on 23 March 2003, the album re-instated the Impossible Princess title in those regions.|$|E
500|$|Babe {{encourages}} Abi to tell Ben she is pregnant. Fitzgerald {{explained that}} when Babe suggests the idea, Abi decides to trust her.

Digital Spy named the moment [...] "the bombshell of all bombshells". Viewers speculated that Abi had lied about the pregnancy and the Sunday Express questioned whether Babe had [...] "put {{the idea in}} Abi's head". The speculation was confirmed in the following episode. Lindsay believed that in the weeks following the scene, viewers would [...] "laugh at Babe and Abi, cry for them, feel for them, root for them and scream furiously at them while throwing plates at [...] televisions." [...] Fitzgerald enjoyed Babe and Abi's friendship and said she [...] "loved" [...] working with Badland, while Badland also liked working with Fitzgerald, saying that she thought Babe and Abi had [...] "genuinely connected" [...] but their friendship was [...] "inevitably soured with all the shenanigans". Lindsay praised the show for [...] "recognising the qualities this insane partnership has" [...] and suggested the portmanteau [...] "Babi" [...] for their pairing. In addition to his comments, Lindsay ran a poll asking readers for their opinions on Babe and Abi's friendship: 54% of people who answered described it as [...] "fantastic", while the other 46% described it as [...] "terrible".|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{reaction}} to the song was also mixed. In {{a review of the}} group's debut album, Edna Gundersen of USA Today said that [...] "Wannabe" [...] is [...] "a melodious but disposable tune that typifies this debut's tart bubblegum and packaged sexiness." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it [...] "insidiously snappy, [...] is shaping up as this year's 'Macarena.'" [...] Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune said that [...] "'Wannabe' has UGH <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it," [...] adding that it was [...] "relentlessly catchy and horrifyingly hummable." [...] The Buffalo News's Anthony Violanti called it [...] "irresistible." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "maniacally zippy single," [...] and Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com referred to it as an [...] "unapologetically sassy dance hit." [...] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch commented that [...] "based on their efficacious American debut single, [...] the Spice Girls might be expected to deliver more of that zingy pop on their debut album," [...] but she felt that [...] "aside from 'Wannabe,' the album's dance tracks are color-by-numbers bland." [...] Larry Flick of Billboard magazine said that [...] "fans of the more edgy girl-group [...] may find this single too fluffy," [...] but added that [...] "everyone else with a love of tasty pop hooks, lyrical positivity, and jaunty rhythms is going to be humming this single for months to come." ...|$|E

Kerrang! magazine's Paul Rees {{described}} [...] "Vow" [...] as [...] "edgy dislocated pop with a sparkling chorus" [...] and [...] "the most brilliant pop song of 1995". Select's Ian Harrison liked the song, but {{felt that it}} [...] "pilfers from The Smiths 'How Soon Is Now?'". In a review for Billboard, Larry Flick rated [...] "Vow" [...] his Critic's Choice and wrote, [...] "Move over Courtney Love. Garbage combine the tough-headed hooks of Hole with an unforgettable vocal prowl which rivals 'Miss World'. A numbed female vocal cries before a raging guitar riff begins to shatter a pain-filled pop texture. Commit to it." [...] Dan Dinello, of Alternative Press, described [...] "Vow" [...] as [...] "menacing tale of violence and revenge sounds like Patti Smith fronting The Clash while quoting the Beatles [...] "No Reply"." [...] Spins Charles Aaron likened the band to [...] "Bunnymen wannabes doing '90s reverb angst" [...] and compared Erikson's guitar to Aldo Nova, but ultimately considered that [...] "even though they sound totally prefab, the singer hints at a pleasantly pissed personality".

500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive. Anna Smith of Empire called it [...] "formulaic and all-American", commenting that many scenes [...] "appear functional rather than inspirational", and that the film focused on the racial issue [...] "a little too heavily". Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character." [...] Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying [...] "on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly." [...] Nick Schager's of Slant Magazine lamented that the [...] "clichés are too numerous to mention", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has [...] "as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings." [...] Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it [...] "virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a [...] "shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good [...] "visual flair" [...] it [...] "is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation."

500|$|The scene between Sue and Roz was {{singled out}} by many reviewers. Bell wrote that she was [...] "really loving the feisty dynamic" [...] between them, {{and that it was}} [...] "about time that Sue had a proper {{sparring}} partner". Flandez called Roz [...] "the delightfully colorful synchronized swimming teacher", and said her [...] "scathing remarks were expertly delivered" [...] and that there were [...] "too many good lines to savor". Futterman said Roz reminded her of [...] "what an entertaining spitfire Sue was during season one", and that Sue is [...] "a shadow of [...] former self" [...] as evidenced by the fact that Roz has not been a victim of Sue's [...] "evil planning". Lynch described the encounter as [...] "one of the episode highlights", though he felt that [...] "the writers overdid it a touch" [...] when Sue [...] "barely got in any retorts" [...] against Roz. Reiter called Roz [...] "a great addition to the cast of characters" [...] and Leakes [...] "spot-on" [...] in the role, also hearkening back to the early Sue. Kubicek said he [...] "might like this subplot" [...] if Leakes did not mistake [...] "shouting for acting", and Slezak commented on Roz's [...] "particularly abhorrent assessment of Sue’s reproductive abilities". Votta, however, declared that the show [...] "should never let NeNe go", and said she [...] "delivers some of the best lines ever". Chaney and Slezak thought that Sue should have been fired immediately for requesting sperm donations from New Directions males, while Lynch merely deemed it a possible detriment to her tenure bid.

Orozco drew, paint and <b>wrote</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the surfaces of the paper. The application and layering of the various media permeated the paper and soaked through to the back side forming an unpredictable, ghostly reflection of the front. The drawings were installed in two-sided glass frames that hung from the wall on hinges so the viewer could see both sides of the paper. Each drawing transitioned from bright, colorful, painterly gestures to linear, geometric shapes and a muted palette. These contrasts reflected the different psychological and environmental changes to which the artist and his drawings were exposed to over extended periods of time.|$|R
