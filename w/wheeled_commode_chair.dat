50|$|A <b>commode</b> <b>chair,</b> {{known in}} British English {{simply as a}} commode, {{is a type of}} chair used by someone who needs help going to the toilet due to illness, injury or disability. A <b>commode</b> <b>chair</b> has {{sometimes}} <b>wheels</b> to transport easily to the bathroom or shower. Most <b>commode</b> <b>chairs</b> have a removable pail and flip-back armrests.|$|R
40|$|Background: Subvastus {{approach}} in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) spares the quadriceps and may assist in faster rehabilitation. The present randomised controlled {{study was conducted}} to determine if the subvastus approach results in early recovery, faster mobilization, shorter hospital stay, and improved function. Materials and Methods: 100 patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral TKA were randomized into two groups: subvastus group and medial parapatellar group. The patients were assessed clinically using VAS, time to straight leg raise, ability to stand with walker, ability to use a <b>commode</b> <b>chair,</b> ability to climb stairs, flexion at discharge, and day of discharge. Perioperative blood loss and duration of surgery were also compared. The patient were kept on same pain management and physiotherapy protocol. The evaluation was done at day 0, 1, 3 and at discharge. Statistical analyses tested the null hypotheses of no differences in patients treated with either group at 95 % significance level (P < 0. 05). Results: The VAS score was significantly lower in subvastus group on day 1 and day 3. Also mean hospital stay was 2. 04 days less in subvastus group. Patients with subvastus approach were able to perform straight leg raising 0. 44 days earlier. Though time to stand with walker was same for both groups, the ability to use <b>commode</b> <b>chair,</b> and climb stairs was significantly early (P < 0. 05) in the subvastus group. The average flexion at the time of discharge in subvastus and parapatellar group were 100. 8 and 96. 8 °, respectively. The mean perioperative blood loss in subvastus group and parapatellar group were 343 ml and 372 ml, respectively. Average surgical time required for subvastus approach and parapatellar approach were 108. 5 and 94. 3 min, respectively. Conclusions: Subvastus approach produce appreciably less pain and faster mobilization due to lesser insult to quadriceps, thus assisting in early rehabilitation, shorter hospital stay, less expenditure, and more patient satisfaction...|$|R
50|$|For a long time, the Belgian Musées royaux d'Art et d'Histoire {{had only}} {{a single piece of}} {{furniture}} stamped by Chapuis, a <b>commode</b> <b>chair</b> bequeathed to the Belgian State by Isabel and Helen Godtschalck in 1915. In the 18th century, as today, there were various euphemisms for this type of chair, such as chaise de commodité (commodity chair), chaise d'aisances (facilities chair), and chaise d'affaire (business chair). This class of furniture was usually made by carpenters rather than cabinetmakers. In 1805, Chapuis was charged with an appraisal of the furnishings of the royal castle of Laeken. In his appraisal, Chapuis called it a chaise de garde (caregiver's chair), a rare term also occurring in the estate inventory of the Empress Josephine at the Château de Malmaison. Both uses refer to an annex to the bedroom, found only in wealthy residences, in which there is specific furniture.|$|R
50|$|A bucket {{toilet and}} an invalid's <b>commode</b> (a <b>chair</b> {{enclosing}} a chamber pot) are basic, simple types of portable toilet, with long histories. Further types {{that can be}} regarded as portable are freezing and incineration toilets, as they are neither connected to a sewer system nor to a hole in the ground. Compost toilets can be designed to be portable.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{alternate}} mobility options, positioning aids {{and other equipment}} that rehab therapists may prescribe. These include walkers or quad-canes, {{which can be used}} for individuals who are able ambulate {{to reduce the risk of}} falling. In addition, transfer boards, mechanical lifts and specific transferring education are important because fractures have been seen to occur during transfers as a result of osteoporosis. Handheld shower heads and bath benches are indicated to enable individuals to manage their own self-care needs as much as possible. Individuals who are able to bear weight and take a few steps may utilize <b>commode</b> <b>chairs,</b> thus giving them the ability to visit the toilet independently. To complement an individualized wheelchair, an occupational therapist may also consider prescribing a hospital bed, pressure-relieving mattresses and foam wedges for proper positioning to prevent pressure skin ulcers, contractures and deformities. Specialized trays, input devices and software may also be prescribed to facilitate computer use.|$|R
40|$|Two {{percent of}} the Irish {{population}} is morbidly obese with this figure expected to rise significantly. This survey aimed to establish the present logistical capacity of Irish emergency departments (EDs) to adequately cater for the bariatric patients. A telephone survey was carried out of 37 health service executive EDs over a 5 -day period in October 2008. Questions were posed to the departmental lead nurse regarding facilities (Supplemental digital content 1). No ED had adequate facilities. Two of 37 units questioned had on-site hoists designed to lift patients of more than 170 kg. Four departments had rapid access to mattresses within the hospital and three of these four had access to beds and trolleys for weighing patients. Two {{percent of the}} Irish population is morbidly obese with this figure expected to rise significantly to more than 150 kg. One department had access to <b>commodes,</b> <b>chairs,</b> wheelchairs and trolleys from inpatient services. All departments had extra-wide blood pressure cuffs and 12 had a difficult airways trolley. Necessary infrastructure and equipment for bariatric patients is deficient {{in the majority of}} Irish EDs...|$|R
40|$|Rectal swabs from 122 {{patients}} and 497 environmental swabs from several wards were examined {{for the presence}} of Clostridium difficile in order to assess the role of the environment in the spread of this organism. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6 / 27 (22. 2 %) oncology {{patients and}} from 8 / 163 (4. 9 %) environmental specimens obtained from the oncology unit. Items found positive for C difficile were those subjected to faecal contamination such as <b>commode</b> <b>chairs,</b> bed pans, dust pans, discard bins, the sluice and a disposable bed pan machine. Fourteen of 51 (27. 4 %) asymptomatic neonates yielded mostly toxigenic C difficile in their stools during their first week of life. Five of 156 (3. 2 %) specimens taken from inanimate objects in the environment of the neonatal units were positive for C difficile. The organism was also isolated from the hands of a nurse. Similar antibiogram patterns were demonstrated in the strains obtained from the patients and their environment indicating the possible occurrence of cross infection. These results indicate that environmental contamination is important in the spread of C difficile in hospitalised patients and the implementation of isolation procedures may limit that spread...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} use of commodes {{and attitudes}} of users and carers to them. DESIGN [...] Interview with semi-structured questionnaire of subjects supplied with commodes from Leeds community appliance centre. SUBJECTS [...] 140 users of a commode and 105 of their carers. RESULTS [...] Main reasons for being supplied with a commode were impaired mobility (130 subjects), difficulty in climbing stairs (128), and urinary incontinence (127). Main concerns of users and carers were lack of privacy (120 subjects felt embarrassed about using their commode, and 96 would not use it if someone was present); unpleasant smells (especially for 20 subjects who were confined to one room); physical appearance of <b>commode</b> <b>chair</b> (101 users said it had an unfavourable appearance, and 44 had tried to disguise it); and lack of follow up after commode was supplied (only 15 users and carers knew who to contact if there were problems). Users generally either had very positive or very negative attitudes to their commodes but most carers viewed them very negatively, {{especially with regard to}} cleaning them. CONCLUSIONS [...] Health professionals should be aware of people's need for privacy when advising them where to keep their commode. A standard commode is inappropriate for people confined to one room, and alternatives such as a chemical toilet should be considered. Regular follow up is needed to identify any problems such as uncomfortable or unsafe chairs. More thought should be given to the appearance of commodes in their design...|$|R
40|$|The Bishop of Broome, the Most Reverend Christopher Saunders, visited The University of Notre Dame Australia Broome Campus nursing {{laboratory}} on 20 February {{to bless}} it {{and two of}} its unique additions. Two computerised manikins purchased {{with the aid of}} generous donations from the wedding of local business owners, Martin and Kim Peirson-Jones and the Matsos’ Classic Car Run, were blessed during the ceremony. The manikins are a sophisticated addition to the nursing laboratory which continues to expand with more than $ 36, 000 worth of equipment added to the campus nursing laboratory already this year. The manikins are operated by remote control and can be programmed by lecturers to cough, vomit and wheeze. They have a pulse, blood pressure and can be linked to cardiac monitors and intravenous giving sets. In a worst case scenario they can even die and be brought back to life using a defibrillator. Assistant Dean of Nursing, Broome, Sally Clark thanked all involved with the donations and said the nursing laboratory was now so well equipped it was set up like a genuine ward with simulated patients, manual handling equipment, <b>commode</b> <b>chairs</b> and defibrillators. “The Simulators bring role play to life,” she said. “Students can now clinically assess and manage a manikin as they would in a hospital ward situation. ” Enrolled Nursing student, Cindy Murray, said the manikins enabled students to experience real life situations when treating patients. “They are excellent. You get to practise as if they were real people. It gives you a great insight into what can happen. ” A record number of students graduated from the Bachelor of Nursing course last July and with ten students already accepted into the new Enrolled Nursing course the School of Nursing looks set for a very productive year.

25|$|Patient {{transfer}} devices generally allow {{patients with}} impaired mobility {{to be moved}} by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, <b>commodes,</b> toilets, <b>chairs,</b> stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|R
