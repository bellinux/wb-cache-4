5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion.

Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use.

5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting storm <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{large and}} fairly strong gale that gradually {{moved across the}} northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E
