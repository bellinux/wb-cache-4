5|$|ButterFly is {{the sixteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on October 1, 1974 by Columbia Records. After releasing The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> earlier in 1974, a collection predominantly consisting of previously released songs, Streisand recorded her first album of entirely new material in over three years. Recorded throughout 1974 and primarily a contemporary pop record, it also incorporates music from the reggae and R genres. All of the tracks on ButterFly are cover songs produced by Streisand's then-boyfriend Jon Peters, originating from artists like Bob Marley, David Bowie, Evie Sands, and Graham Nash.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Streisand's vocals {{and found the}} record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> topped the Billboard 200 in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

[...] After the minister criticized him, Giuliani diverted funds away from projects connected to him, and when Butts supported Governor George Pataki's re-election, Giuliani told Pataki he should not accept Butts' support. (Pataki did accept the endorsement.) ...|$|R

25|$|After {{finished}} filming Raymond Yip's film Phantom of the Theatre in Shanghai, Lin {{joined the}} cast of the licensed remake of the Korean variety show We Got Married, titled We Are In Love.

5000|$|Comparing {{ourselves}} to others is something humans {{do all the}} time. [...] "In doing so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> acknowledging not so much our sameness to othersor our difference, but rather the commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because {{each one of us}} is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of absolute similarities and a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similarities in the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> different from one another and differences in the <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the same. That <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to do this {{is a function of the}} genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny".|$|R

But his overall career was flourishing with the critical and box office hit Jeremiah Johnson (1972); the political satire The Candidate (1972); the hugely popular period drama The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> (1973); and the biggest hit of his career, the blockbuster crime caper The Sting (1973), which {{became one of the}} top 20 highest-grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation and for which he was also nominated for an Oscar.|$|E

Lin stated that she will continue to film one Taiwanese series per year.

Since its debut on July 19, the drama has stayed within the top two on iQiyi’s most popular dramas list.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same <b>way...</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
