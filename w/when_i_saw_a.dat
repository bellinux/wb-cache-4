500|$|Once Texas {{switched}} to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290yards, including 216yards and threelong touchdown runs in the fourthquarter. [...] His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms. [...] Charles explained [...] "It was my time to show everyone what I can do. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> hole, I blasted through it." [...] Texas finished with 181yards passing and 364yards rushing; Nebraska had 315yards passing and 132yards rushing. [...] The running back was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week.|$|E

2500|$|A New Russian {{and an old}} man lie injured {{side-by-side}} in {{an emergency}} room: [...] "How did you get here, old fella?" [...] / [...] "I had an old Zaporozhets car, and I installed my war trophy Messerschmitt jet engine in it. While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it. My speed was too high, I lost control, and crashed into a tree... And {{how did you get}} here?" [...] / [...] "I was driving my Ferrari <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Zaporozhets overtaking me. I thought that my car might have broken down again, and had coasted to a stop.

60|$|Once Jerry {{tried to}} say {{something}} to me, but I pushed him back petulantly, so strong a hold had the fever of battle upon me. My musket barrel grew hot to the touch, and it was no longer possible to charge it properly. Without compunctions I exchanged weapons with one of the dead men at my feet, and continued the work, shouting aloud in vengeful joy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> enemy fall by my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{scarcely}} in my senses, the yells and shots ringing dimly in my ears, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> Indian before me, busied {{over the body}} of the Frenchman I had just shot, but glancing towards me as I lay on the ground bleeding. He first rifled the Frenchman, tearing open his coat, and feeling in his pockets: he then scalped him, and with his bleeding knife in his mouth advanced towards me. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him coming as through a film, as in a dream--I was powerless to move, or to resist him.|$|R
60|$|I felt doubly {{certain of}} it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> motor {{speeding}} towards {{me with a}} stout man, in military uniform and a Prussian helmet, seated behind the chauffeur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; not too many. I didn't trouble myself {{much about}} it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> {{pheasant}} I shot it. I've {{been a little}} troubled in spirit, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{number of}} the days had risen to ten, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> greater change in him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and lighted up as I entered.|$|E
50|$|I was {{privileged to}} benefit from Bishop David's advice and {{friendship}} over the years. Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>a</b> few days before he died, he typically ministered to {{me as much as}} I to him.|$|R

60|$|I {{was going}} out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> great big, fat, interesting-looking book lying there, and I took it up. It was {{an account of the}} {{invasion}} of England in the fourteenth century by the Preaching Friar, and it interested me.|$|E

60|$|The lion {{was driven}} {{from my mind}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> troop of deer cross a glade below me. I had to fight myself to keep from shooting. The wind blew rather strong in my face, which {{probably}} accounted for the deer not winding me.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the signal was given and we were at it. Kari leapt at me like the tree-lion of his own forests, but I avoided and parried. Thrice he leapt and thrice I did this; yes, even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opening and might have cut him down. Almost I struck, then could not. The Chancas watched me, {{wondering}} what game I played who was not wont to fight in this fashion, and I also wondered, who still knew not what to do. Something I must do, or presently I should be slain, since soon my guard would fail and Deleroy's sword get home at last.|$|R

[...] "I was walking on the old wall, which, as you know, runs close by the house, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> ill looking loon hiding himself as if watching the house, looking behind <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> another ruffianly looking man there." [...] Two gasps of indignation were heard from the porch {{at the back of the}} court. [...] "Thinking that there was mischief on hand I leapt from the wall to the dormer window to warn the people of the house that there were ill doers who had designs upon the place, and then remained to see what came of it. That is the simple fact." ...|$|R
60|$|I had one strange {{experience}} as I came from this second visit which had involved my being {{away for a}} night from my companions. I was returning along the well-remembered route, and had reached a spot within {{a mile or so}} of the marsh of the pterodactyls, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary object approaching me. It was a man who walked inside a framework made of bent canes so that he was enclosed on all sides in a bell-shaped cage. As I drew nearer I was more amazed still to see that it was Lord John Roxton. When he saw me he slipped from under his curious protection and came towards me laughing, and yet, as I thought, with some confusion in his manner.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I was played out, {{and gave up}} hope. The {{schooner}} was still two hundred feet away. My face was in the water, and I was watching him maneuver for another attempt, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> brown body pass between us. It was Otoo.|$|E
6000|$|So I woke up. Just at {{that moment}} there was a cry of [...] "cock forward." [...] I thought it meant a cock pheasant, and was {{astonished}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> beautiful brown bird with a long beak flitting towards me through {{the tops of the}} oak trees.|$|E
60|$|Dor. You {{might as}} well have asked me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>A</b> crested dragon, or a basilisk; Both are less poison to my eyes and nature, He knows not I am I; nor shall he see me, Till time has perfected a labouring thought, That rolls within my breast.|$|E

'I was {{standing}} watching the tremendous {{force of the}} stream, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> unhappy old ram floating along, bleating so piteously, and making such absurd, helpless struggles, that I could not help pulling off my coat and jumping in after him. It was very foolish, for the stream was too strong--I was two years younger then. Moreover, the beast was very heavy, {{and not at all}} grateful for any kind intentions, and I found myself sailing off to the sea, with the prospect of a good many rocks before long; but just then an old tree stretched out its friendly arms through the water; it stopped the sheep, and I caught hold of the branches, and managed to scramble up, while my friend got entangled in them with his wool'-- ...|$|R
60|$|Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, {{as the sun}} {{declined}} {{towards the}} horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> line of high land towards the south.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} are wrong, Doctor, but I thought myself there was a change for the worse <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>an</b> hour ago; there was a drawn look about his face I did not like. He is a splendid fellow; nothing could have been kinder than he has been to me. I wish I could change places with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Private T. George, 69th Company Imperial Yeomanry, being duly sworn, states: 'I {{was walking}} back to camp wounded, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Boer about {{seventeen}} years of age shoot at a wounded Derby man who was calling for water; the Boer then {{came up to me}} and took my bandolier away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed it was," [...] he replied. [...] "The {{labor was}} arduous and {{occupied}} me several hours. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> respectable {{man at a}} fire, and a stage-coach near by, I felt rewarded for all my trouble. May I ask you, sir, how you came to be thus snow-bound?" ...|$|E
60|$|So, as I was saying, I {{had gone}} down upon one knee, and was just {{reaching}} out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> sight that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath, for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{developed}} itself, I should say, {{two hours}} after the fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about {{a mile and a}} half below Kurtz's station. We had just floundered and flopped round <b>a</b> bend, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sandbank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river. They were discolored, just awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left of this. I didn't know either channel, of course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the western passage.|$|R
60|$|They had {{postponed}} their {{breakfast on}} my account, {{and we sat}} down to table together. We had not been seated long, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> approaching arrival in Mrs. Strong's face, before I heard any sound of it. A gentleman on horseback came to the gate, and leading his horse into the little court, with the bridle over his arm, {{as if he were}} quite at home, tied him to a ring in the empty coach-house wall, and came into the breakfast parlour, whip in hand. It was Mr. Jack Maldon; and Mr. Jack Maldon was not at all improved by India, I thought. I {{was in a state of}} ferocious virtue, however, as to young men who were not cutting down trees in the forest of difficulty; and my impression must be received with due allowance.|$|R
40|$|I last {{made use}} of lottery theory six weeks ago. It {{was in a car}} park in Oxford. I had been searching for almost ten minutes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> empty space. <b>I</b> reached it at {{precisely}} the same time as another car. We both stopped to avoid collision. I asked the other driver how long {{he had been in the}} car park. He too had been searching for a space for about ten minutes. We agreed to toss a coin in order to decide which of us should take the space. The principle behind our allocation of the scarce resource was that the person who had first entered the car park should have priority. Since we didn't know who this was, a random method, giving us each an equal chance, seemed best. It didn't cross our minds to seek further information, such as: what was each of u...|$|R
60|$|His {{hand was}} {{reaching}} upward for the stern <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> sleek, sinuous body shoot {{from the depths}} below.

60|$|I {{began to}} doubt whether I {{could be sure}} of {{locating}} the spring, and I finally decided to make camp at once. I stopped Hal, and had swung my leg over the pommel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> faint glimmer of light far ahead. It twinkled like a star, but was not white and cold enough for a star.|$|E
60|$|It was {{twenty-five years}} ago <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> young clerk in Putnam's bookstore. I went in there and asked for George Haven Putnam, and handed him my card, and then {{the young man said}} Mr. Putnam was busy and I couldn't see him. Well, I had merely called in a social way, and so it didn't matter.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was about}} to disdain to reply, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> old man approaching, with bowed head, {{apparently}} in deep distress. As he drew near he saluted my distinguished interlocutor {{in the manner of}} the country, by putting out his tongue to its full extent and moving it slowly from side to side. Gnarmag-Zote acknowledged the civility by courteously spitting, and the old man, advancing, seated himself at the great officer's feet, saying: [...] "Exalted Sir, I have just lost my wife by death, and am in a most melancholy frame of mind. He who has mastered all the vices of the ancients and wrested from nature the secret of the normal curvature of cats' claws can surely spare from his wisdom a few rays of philosophy to cheer an old man's gloom. Pray tell me what I shall do to assuage my grief." ...|$|R
