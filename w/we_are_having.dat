2500|$|The Vice Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Joint Staff said [...] "We do {{not have}} enough forces there. That is why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> a new division, the 14th Division, to be built in Basrah, {{especially}} with the possibility that the British might be leaving us in time.". The formation of this new division was not scheduled to be completed before June 2008 and was accelerated to deal with the upcoming operation.

2500|$|After the Vienna Award, the Hungarian {{government}} and United Hungarian Party together organized celebrations and a triumphant entry of the Hungarian army into the annexed territories. Organizers consciously imitated {{the entry of}} Hitler's army into the Sudetenland. The result of arbitration was met by {{the most of the}} Hungarian population with local statements of disagreement. Hungarian Honvéds were not welcomed also in some [...] "pure Hungarian" [...] villages and in one village their accommodation had to be arranged by force. A few days before the arbitration, Budapest also received messages from some of borderline villages refusing annexation by Hungary ("Stay there, do not liberate us. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> a good time, better than you, liberate yourself"). The Vienna Award finally refuted inter-war Hungarian propaganda that [...] "Slovak brothers" [...] dreamed about return to the thousand-years-old Hungarian Empire and that they could not openly declare their opinion under Czech domination.|$|E

2500|$|Ten {{days after}} Presley met with President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1970, the singer {{was granted a}} private tour of FBI Headquarters.

[...] In Presley's opinion, the source for the disaffected youth of the day owed to the existence of [...] "the Smothers Brothers, Jane Fonda, and other persons in the entertainment industry of their ilk," [...] because they had [...] "poisoned young minds by disparaging the United States in their public statements and unsavory activities."
