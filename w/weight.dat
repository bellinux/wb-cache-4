40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{previous}} research on term <b>weighting</b> for information retrieval has focused on developing specialized parametric term <b>weighting</b> functions. Examples include T F. IDF vector-space formulations, BM 25, and language modeling <b>weighting.</b> Each of these term <b>weighting</b> functions takes on a specific parametric form. While these <b>weighting</b> functions {{have proven to be}} highly effective, they impose strict constraints on the functional form of the term <b>weights.</b> Such constraints may possibly degrade retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we propose two new classes of term <b>weighting</b> schemes that we call semi-parametric and nonparametric <b>weighting.</b> These <b>weighting</b> schemes make fewer assumptions about the underlying term <b>weights</b> and allow the data to speak for itself. We argue that these robust <b>weighting</b> schemes have the potential to be significantly more effective compared to existing parametric schemes, especially with the growing amount of training data becoming available. ...|$|R

5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated <b>weight</b> on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's <b>weight</b> is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their <b>weight</b> into a small area.

This difference in <b>weight</b> distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body <b>weight</b> while standing up.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{selection}} of the profiles of <b>weights</b> to be used in cross-efficiency evaluations. In an attempt to prevent unrealistic <b>weighting</b> schemes, one of the issues of main interest that we address here is that of the zero <b>weights,</b> since their use implies that some of the variables considered are excluded from the assessments to be made. In the calculation of cross-efficiency scores, we propose to ignore the profiles of <b>weights</b> of the DMUs that cannot make a choice of non-zero <b>weights</b> among their alternate optima. The different units are therefore assessed in a peer-evaluation that does not consider the profiles of <b>weights</b> of some inefficient DMUs. This approach is referred to as "peer-restricted" cross-efficiency evaluation. Aside from avoiding zero <b>weights,</b> the choice of <b>weights</b> that we make also seeks to reduce the differences between the <b>weights</b> profiles selected as much as possible. Thus, in the "peer-restricted" cross-efficiency evaluation in the present paper we also try to avoid that the different DMUs attach very different <b>weights</b> to the same variable. Finally, we extend this approach to derive a common set of <b>weights</b> by exploiting the idea of similarity between profiles of <b>weights.</b> Cross-efficiency evaluation DEA <b>Weights</b> Common set of <b>weights...</b>|$|R
