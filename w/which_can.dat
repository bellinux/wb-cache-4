5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective.

These can be exchanged for gold, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be used to buy upgrades for the ship.

If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes, where a legendary hero rewards him by giving him a new weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game <b>which</b> <b>can</b> be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables.
