5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

On the second aldol reaction, the product which is a 1,3 dicarbonyl is formed in high diastereoselectivity. This is because the acidity of the proton is significantly reduced because for the deprotonation to occur, it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a developing allylic strain in the unfavored conformation. In the favored conformation, the proton is not aligned properly for deprotonation to occur.|$|E

Both forwards <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> unclaimed on waivers for twenty four hours before they are officially assigned the Crunch. The Lightning also provided an update on injured backup goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Today Vasilevskiy did an on ice work out goalie coach Frantz Jean, facing shots from close range. He is still on blood thinners, which is restricting him from facing shots in the left shoulder area. He has an appointment on October 21, which will hopefully clear him for a return to full practice. Vasilevskiy stated that he thinks he will need a few games in Syracuse on a conditioning assignment before he is ready to return to the lineup.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and {{so there would be}} nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It is not clear {{what is going to happen}} as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{began their}} defence {{of the league}} title against newly {{promoted}} team Nottingham Forest on 17 August 1998. A goal by Overmars, eleven minutes from the end gave Arsenal the win; Geoff Thomas equalised for Nottingham Forest after Petit headed in the opening goal. A goalless draw against Liverpool was followed by successive 0–0 draws, at home to Charlton Athletic and away to Chelsea. Stephen Hughes scored a last minute equaliser at Filbert Street on 12 September 1998 to deny Leicester City a win. After the match, Wenger admitted the club {{were looking for a}} new striker to replace Ian Wright, being impressed with Leicester City's goalscorer Emile Heskey: [...] "We will still be buying a striker but unfortunately Leicester do not want to sell Heskey so we <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> somewhere else … I'm impressed by Heskey. Today he did very well offensively and tried like crazy; too much for me." [...] In Arsenal's next match, at home to Manchester United, goals from Tony Adams, Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg helped the champions inflict a 3–0 defeat; the result was Wenger's third consecutive win over rival manager Alex Ferguson. However, in the following match, Arsenal lost {{for the first time in}} the season, against Sheffield Wednesday. Substitute Lee Briscoe scored in the 89th minute, lobbing the ball precisely over goalkeeper Alex Manninger after Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was sent off for pushing the referee.|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain.

[...] In his introduction to the British hardcover edition of the revised work, Bishop writes [...] "…I still feel affection for the original version of A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire, its callow narrator, {{and a few of}} the flavorful images and metaphors with which I salted the text. But I also recognize the fumble-fingeredness and immaturity of that initial version." [...] Very few publications (mostly fanzines) took enough notice to review the new version. (Pocket Books even used the artwork of the original publisher's edition.) [...] In one of the rare reviews, Robert Frazier writes [...] "In almost every detail, Eyes of Fire is crafted intelligently… It is not the type of sf that pushes to the heights of wonder. [...] Instead it is a probing, disturbing, moving reflection on humanity… Bishop's skill is at plumbing to the depths, and his basic tool is a two-way glass.

The difference between these two courses is that in the [...] "Special" [...] stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme). Mother Tongue teachers conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, unless the student's Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5. a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered better, if they meet set benchmarks. The Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC) provides free language education for most additional languages that other schools may not cover, and provides the bulk of such education, admitting several thousand students each year.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 January, it was {{announced}} that the church had had its listing upgraded to Grade 1 status. Announcing the decision, Andrew Derrick stated:"Grade I is the right grade for St. Laurence's Church and it confirms it as a very important building. Only the two per cent most important buildings in the country are Grade I listed so now the church is in the same bracket as the most important buildings. This means that demolishing the church would be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a difference on how people view the building." [...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion. We have to comply with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must be implemented. The future hinges on these plans." [...] The vicar of the church, Rev. Nigel Ransom, was delighted at the news."I was not surprised to hear from English Heritage that the church has been upgraded to a Grade I listed building. It is a unique and historic place. For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture. The decision by English Heritage will certainly {{make it more difficult for}} any plans to move the church. The local community is firmly against any changes and so am I." ...|$|E
