25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Paula Jones {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E

50|$|Simply put, the president's {{deposition}} testimony regarding {{whether he}} had ever been alone <b>with</b> Ms. (<b>Monica)</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> was intentionally false, and his statements regarding {{whether he had}} ever engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally false....|$|R

500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b>|$|E
500|$|Frank {{is known}} for his quick wit and rapid-fire {{speaking}} style. In one quip, he said he was unable to complete his review of the Starr Report detailing President Bill Clinton's relationship <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> complaining that it was [...] "too much reading about heterosexual sex". In 2004 and again in 2006, a survey of Capitol Hill staffers published in Washingtonian gave Frank the title of the [...] "brainiest", [...] "funniest", and [...] "most eloquent" [...] member of the House. In 2008, the same survey named him [...] "brainiest", and runner up for [...] "workhorse", and [...] "most eloquent"; in 2010, he was named [...] "brainiest", [...] "workhorse", and [...] "funniest". He is also widely considered to have been, during his tenure, {{one of the most powerful}} members of Congress. Democratic speech writer Josh Gottheimer, in his book Ripples of Hope: Great American Civil Rights Speeches, describes Frank as [...] "one of the brightest and most energetic defenders of civil rights issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early September, Lamont {{attacked}} Lieberman's {{response to}} the 1998 scandal involving President Clinton's affair <b>with</b> intern <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> claiming Lieberman had created a [...] "media spectacle". Lieberman responded by releasing an e-mail Lamont sent the senator at the time, in which Lamont wrote he reluctantly supported Lieberman's stance critical of Clinton.|$|R
25|$|Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Representative from Georgia {{and leader}} of the Republican Revolution of 1994, {{admitted}} in 1998 to having had an affair with a House intern while he was married to his second wife, {{at the same time as}} he was leading the impeachment of Bill Clinton for perjury regarding an affair <b>with</b> intern <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In his {{deposition}} for the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having [...] "sexual relations" [...] <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> On {{the basis}} of the evidence provided by Monica Lewinsky, a blue dress with Clinton's semen, Ken Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.|$|E
2500|$|Like Bill Clinton and Dick Gephardt, Lieberman {{served as}} chair of the Democratic Leadership Council from 1995–2001. In 1998, Lieberman was the first {{prominent}} Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> [...] However, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{deposition}} in the Jones case, Clinton was asked, [...] "Have {{you ever had}} sexual relations <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit1, as modified by the Court?" [...] The definition included contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of a person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of that person, any contact of the genitals or anus of another person, or contact of one's genitals or anus and any part of another person's body either directly or through clothing. The judge ordered that Clinton be {{given an opportunity to}} review the agreed definition. Clinton flatly denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Later, at the Starr grand jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex.|$|E

However, after each country agreed to be bailed out by the IMF, foreign investors immediately pulled their money out of those countries, leaving their taxpayers with enormous debts and triggering massive economic disasters.|$|R
50|$|When the Republicans won {{control of}} Congress in 1994, Callahan became the {{chairman}} of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs. Callahan had voted against numerous foreign aid bills before taking the chairmanship, and he remained skeptical of foreign aid. In 1998, Callahan became briefly notorious after it became known that he was speaking by phone with President Bill Clinton during one of the President's first sexual encounters <b>with</b> aide <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> In 2001, Callahan became {{the chairman of}} the Energy and Water Development subcommittee.|$|R
2500|$|During the deposition, Clinton {{was asked}} [...] "Have {{you ever had}} sexual {{relations}} <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?" [...] The judge ordered that Clinton be {{given an opportunity to}} review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, [...] "I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky." [...] Clinton later stated, [...] "I thought the definition included any activity by , where [...] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies" [...] which had been explicitly listed (and [...] "with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person"). In other words, Clinton denied that he had ever contacted Lewinsky's [...] "genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] included giving oral sex but excluded receiving oral sex.|$|E
2500|$|The case came to {{the fore}} in 1998, when Bill Clinton's {{attorneys}} invoked it as a defense to perjury charges brought by the House of Representatives during his impeachment. They argued that lawyers for Paula Jones had failed to follow up on questions asking Clinton generally if he had ever been alone <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> to which he had answered [...] "I don't recall". Even though later testimony had established that she was indeed alone with him on several brief occasions, he had not specifically denied it and that the Jones lawyers' failure to ask follow-up questions about specific occasions barred prosecution as surely as the similar failure by Bronston's questioner. They also cited other occasions where Clinton had similarly claimed he didn't remember, and his questioners had simply left the answer at that. The president's purportedly false testimony was, to them, [...] "simply a confused deposition record that could have been clarified contemporaneously".|$|E
2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, and that you understand what they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? People have said that to me. They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Man of Steel, Lane was tapped to play Hillary Clinton in an NBC miniseries, Hillary, which was {{supposed}} to [...] "start <b>with</b> the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> morning-after...And then continue on until she was embarking on her [...] presidential bid." [...] Intense media backlash ultimately caused NBC to cancel the series. In 2015, Lane appeared in the drama Every Secret Thing (alongside Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Banks), had a voice role in the Pixar animated feature Inside Out, and co-starred in the biopic Trumbo (opposite Bryan Cranston and Helen Mirren), which received a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Best Ensemble Cast. In 2017, Lane starred as the lead role in Eleanor Coppola's Paris Can Wait, opposite Alec Baldwin.|$|R
5000|$|NOW {{has been}} criticized by various pro-life, conservative, and fathers' rights groups. During the 1990s, NOW was criticized for having a double {{standard}} when it refused to support Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against former Democratic President Bill Clinton, while calling for the resignation of Republican politician (Bob Packwood), {{who was accused of}} similar assault by 10 women. (The Jones suit was later dismissed by Republican female judge Susan Webber Wright, who characterized Jones' claim as without merit.) Jones appealed but later dropped her suit after reaching a settlement out of court. Judge Webber Wright later held President Clinton in contempt of court for giving [...] "intentionally false" [...] testimony about his relationship <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> S. <b>Lewinsky</b> in the Paula Jones lawsuit, marking {{the first time that a}} sitting president has been sanctioned for disobeying a court order.|$|R
2500|$|Bob Minton, at {{the time}} a {{prominent}} critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award. [...] In her speech at the event, Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority Commissioner Ursula Caberta cited Minton's recognition of [...] "what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology." [...] Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization. [...] At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated [...] "By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, there are people in America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide." [...] Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the Lisa McPherson Trust helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court. [...] The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg and Saxony. [...] The letter stated that Sect Commissioner Thomas Gandow should be dismissed, and said that the Saxon state church should [...] "distance itself from the [...] procedure." [...] In response, Gandow stated that Clinton had received the Charlemagne Award despite his affair <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> [...] The awards ceremony took place at the old stock exchange in the Old City of Leipzig. [...] The award given to Minton was presented as a sculpture of the St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig, and was created by Leipzig artist Ruediger Bartels. [...] The award presentation was held on June 3, 2000, one day after the presentation of the official Charlemagne Award to President Bill Clinton by Aachen Mayor Jürgen Linden.|$|E
