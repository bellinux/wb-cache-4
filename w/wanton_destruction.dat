5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E

60|$|The one {{singular}} {{thing to}} me in this <b>wanton</b> work of <b>destruction,</b> {{was the fact that}} not all the buildings in this portion of the city had been given over to the flames.

But the court found he had closed his eyes to their mistreatment and failed to punish their killers. The three judges acquitted him of all charges related to the <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> of Serb villages. The judges also took into account the lack of food and supplies and resulting lack of order and law during the Serbian siege on Srebrenica.|$|E

It is said by local inhabitants that the civil engineer responsible was tried, convicted and received a prison sentence for what was described as <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> of a historic site. There is also a small circular council hall (bouleuterion) or assembly space (ekklesiasterion), with seats in tiers. It was probably never roofed, but had a wall around it, perhaps with a small arcade round the inside. This ceased to {{have a role in}} Roman times and was filled over.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinction}} {{needs to}} be made between the destruction of houses as an incidental effect of military necessity, the <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> of houses during a military advance, and the deliberate targeting of houses during a military occupation. In the former case, it is commonplace for civilian homes to be used by armed forces as places of shelter or as firing positions. As a result, civilian dwellings become a legitimate military target and property damage is often inevitable as forces seek to expel their opponents from buildings. This can result in the destruction of houses on a massive scale as a side-effect of urban warfare. Following World War II, for instance, the United States occupation authorities in Germany found that 81 percent of all houses in the American Zone had been destroyed or damaged in the fighting.|$|E

This view is commonly held by adherents of the Christian faith, in particular those affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church (de Rosa, 2005).

By another accident, equally fortunate, two labouring men at work in the neighbourhood, were led by curiosity secretly to follow the Lieutenant and his myrmidons up to the Stone.

25|$|The Shulchan Aruch quotes the Talmud {{that because}} {{scissors}} have two blades, it would therefore {{be permitted to}} trim the beard by using them, since the cutting action would come from contact between two blades and not from that between blade and skin. In Germany and Italy, {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century, Jews started removing beards with the aid of pumice stones and chemical depilatories, which would leave the face smooth, as if it had been shaven. These are non-razor shaves which are not prohibited. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (Tzemach Tzedek) argued that shaving a beard would fall under the biblical regulation against males resembling a female (he also extended the prohibition for <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> to destroying the hair of the beard); the Shulchan Aruch interpreted this regulation in a different way, arguing that it forbade men from removing hair from areas where women were accustomed to remove hair, such as underarm hair and pubic hair.|$|E

Enver Hadžihasanović, a general of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was sentenced to 3.5 years for authority over acts of murder and <b>wanton</b> <b>destruction</b> in Central Bosnia. Hazim Delić was the Bosniak Deputy Commander of the Čelebići prison camp, which detained Serb civilians. He was sentenced to 18 years by the ICTY Appeals Chamber on 8 April 2003 for murder and torture of the prisoners and for raping two Serbian women.

Enclosing the first unconquered wall, the Temple, and the fortress by another wall of his own making, he sat down and waited for starvation to do its work. Then came the famine. At the beginning, before the maddened, devil-inspired factions began to destroy each other and to prey upon the peaceful people, Jerusalem was amply provisioned. But each party squandered the stores that were within its reach, and, whenever they could do so, burnt those of their rivals, so that the food which might have supplied the whole city for months, vanished quickly in orgies of <b>wanton</b> waste and <b>destruction.</b> Now all, or almost all, was gone, and by tens and hundreds of thousands the people starved.|$|R
