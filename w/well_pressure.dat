5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine <b>well</b> <b>pressure,</b> and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in <b>well</b> <b>pressure.</b> The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E
50|$|The grease {{injector}} head {{is the main}} apparatus for controlling <b>well</b> <b>pressure</b> while running into the hole. The grease head uses a series of very small pipes, called flow tubes, to decrease the pressure head of the well.

50|$|A {{wireline}} control valve, {{also called}} a wireline blow out preventer(BOP), is an enclosed device {{with one or}} more rams capable of closing over the wireline in an emergency.

50|$|Ram BOPs are {{typically}} {{designed so that}} <b>well</b> <b>pressure</b> will help maintain the rams in their closed, sealing position. That is achieved by allowing fluid to pass through a channel in the ram and exert pressure at the ram’s rear and {{toward the center of}} the wellbore. Providing a channel in the ram also limits the thrust required to overcome well bore pressure.|$|E

When the narrator took her home from the dance the town sheriff was waiting at her house. He had brought the narrator’s parents as <b>well.</b> <b>Pressure</b> from the sheriff forces the narrator to agree not to see Alice.

50|$|Gas flaring at many {{oil and gas}} {{production}} sites protects against the dangers of over-pressuring industrial plant equipment. When petroleum crude oil is extracted and produced from onshore or offshore oil wells, raw natural gas associated with the oil is brought to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking pipelines and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such associated gas are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas. The flaring of associated gas may occur {{at the top of a}} vertical flare stack (as in the adjacent photo) or it may occur in a ground-level flare in an earthen pit. Preferably, associated gas is reinjected into the reservoir, which saves it for future use while maintaining higher <b>well</b> <b>pressure</b> and crude oil producibility.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, local flow {{metering}} was done using high maintenance mechanical circular chart recorders. Today {{these have been}} replaced with electrically powered remote terminal units (RTU). Multiple remote terminal units communicate to a central host system via radio systems or tap into the cellular phone system. The host (or central control room) communicates with the RTUs and radio communication infrastructure {{is referred to as}} a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. In addition to gas {{flow metering}}, the RTU also provides some local, self-contained, site control such as well shut-in in the event of abnormal gas flow conditions. However the bulk of the RTU's function is to provide the host with site specific data which includes the above-mentioned gas flow metering data, plus process related data including pipeline and/or <b>well</b> <b>pressure,</b> condensate tank levels etc.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic {{tomography}} (HT) is a sequential cross-hole {{hydraulic test}} followed by inversion {{of all the}} data to map the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic properties. Specifically, HT involves installation of multiple wells in an aquifer, which are partitioned into several intervals along the depth using packers. A sequential aquifer test at selected intervals is then conducted. During the test, water is injected or withdrawn (i.e., a pressure excitation) at a selected interval in a given <b>well.</b> <b>Pressure</b> responses of the subsurface are then monitored at other intervals at this well and other wells. This test produces a set of pressure excitation/response data of the subsurface. Once a test is completed, the pump is moved to another interval and the test is repeated to collect another set of data. The same procedure is then applied to the intervals at other wells. Afterward, the data sets from all tests are processed by a mathematical model to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties of the aquifer. These pairs of pumping and drawdown data sets at different locations make an inverse problem better posed since each pair cross-validates the others such that the estimates become less non-unique. In other words, predictions of ground water flow based on the HT estimates will be more accurate and less uncertain than those based on estimates from traditional site-characterization approaches and model calibrations.|$|E
