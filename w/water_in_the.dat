5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River <b>water.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff {{is not limited to the}} lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> deep thermal <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two {{carbonate}} aquifers of the SW German Molasse basin {{have different}} hydrochemical properties. While <b>the</b> deep <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Jurassic still have drinking water quality within depth {{of up to}} 1, 200 m, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Muschelkalk are highly mineralized. <b>In</b> both aquifers, <b>the</b> NaCl concentration is increasing with depth, resp. <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SE direction. The salinity is independent of geology {{and the type of}} aquifer rock (dolostone, limestone).|$|R
30|$|All deep <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Jurassic and the Upper Muschelkalk {{aquifers}} are {{saturated with}} respect to calcite and quartz, more or less saturated {{with respect to}} gypsum and anhydrite. They are slightly oversaturated with respect to dolomite. With respect to barite, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Jurassic aquifer are slightly over- or undersaturated, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Muschelkalk aquifer, most waters seem to be slightly oversaturated (PHREEQE, Parkhurst and Appelo [1999]). Especially, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Muschelkalk aquifer have a certain scaling potential if pumped and used in geothermal energy applications.|$|R
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's <b>Water)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E

5|$|Engine number 4 {{suffered}} only minor, external damage. It was dismantled by {{the investigation}} team {{in an attempt}} to determine why it might have been shut down by the crew. A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the fuel flow meter on engine number 4. Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as magnesium hydroxide. This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water, suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine. Charles Gibbs, an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation, estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved. Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not account for this much <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel passages. Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident. He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel flow passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed. This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel reaching engine number 4. The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion. Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground, and the crew's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller, may have been related to <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fuel reaching that engine. Similarly, the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W.

Previous detections of <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
