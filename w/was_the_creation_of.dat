5|$|The form of kingdom which {{appeared}} in Constantine's reign continued {{in much the same}} way until the Davidian Revolution in the 12th century. As with his ecclesiastical reforms, his political legacy <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.|$|E
5|$|By 1890 {{official}} {{slum clearance}} programmes had begun. One <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, {{better known as}} The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further slum clearance.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{appointed}} his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav's task <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> {{a buffer}} zone {{along the southern}} borders. He occupied Bosnia already {{in the year of}} his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he only used it occasionally in the subsequent years.|$|E

5|$|His {{first major}} task <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The {{government}} established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives. Blamey supported {{the creation of}} a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble become its first chief.|$|E
5|$|Lassie is an American {{television}} series {{that follows the}} adventures of a female Rough Collie dog named Lassie and her companions, both human and animal. The show <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 25, 1973. The fourth longest-running U.S. primetime {{television series}} after The Simpsons, Gunsmoke, and Law & Order, the show chalked up 17 seasons on CBS before entering first-run syndication for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.|$|E
5|$|One of Sikorski's {{political}} goals <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a Central and Eastern European federation, {{starting with the}} Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation. He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were {{to stand up to}} traditional German and Russian imperialism. That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year. On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni. In March 1941 he visited the United States; he would visit USA again in March and December 1942.|$|E

5|$|Order of Weavers Formed on 17 July 1947, the Orde van Weefsters Vita Feminea Textura, or the Order of Weavers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> {{the wives}} of Dutch Freemasons. They {{constructed}} a ritual system using the tools of weaving in their symbology, which they judged to be more appropriate for women than stonemasons tools. There are now 17 lodges spread through the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> {{producer}} and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, {{the aim was}} to create an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, a reversal of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E
5|$|Some of the characters' {{names were}} {{slightly}} changed from their original versions from the graphic novel: the surname of the real-life gangsters John Looney {{and his son}} Connor were changed to Rooney, and the surname of Tom Hanks' character and his family was streamlined from the original O'Sullivan to simply Sullivan. One significant addition to the script <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to the Sullivans' departure from the old world.|$|E

5|$|The Lubrański Academy, an {{institution}} of higher learning, was established in Poznań in 1519. The Reformation resulted {{in the establishment of}} a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The Kraków University in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} a main {{location}} for the film, was substantially set-dressed. Despite having several original medieval wall paintings, the largest addition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes. To create the impression of an austere country church, Victorian stone flags were replaced with brick pavers {{for the duration of}} filming and the original wall paintings covered up. Plastic guttering and other modern additions were covered up or removed. The churchyard had several gravestones added, including the large box tomb {{which is a}} focus of several scenes.|$|E
5|$|Alley {{was one of}} the few {{figures who}} were trusted by {{northern}} and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.|$|E

5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings {{could be built}} around {{the inside of the}} shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. The Senate had ceased to have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th century, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> themes, where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E
5|$|One of Simpson's first tasks was {{to confer}} with the Chief Signals Officer at General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area, Brigadier General Spencer B. Akin. The two {{established}} mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Central Bureau as a combined signals intelligence organisation. Simpson {{had been thinking about}} such an organisation while on the Orcades. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start, signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Reviews {{of fiction}} and popular science books were published, {{and there was}} a science column which {{endeavored}} to answer readers' questions. These features were at first of good quality, but deteriorated after Lasser's departure, although it is not certain that Lasser wrote the content of either one. An influential non-fiction initiative <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Science Fiction League, an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across the country. Gernsback took the opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia, and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as a good source of publicity. It was ultimately more important in becoming one of the foundations of science fiction fandom.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as {{the party}} of free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the understandings canvassed so far, justice may {{be understood as a}} human creation, rather than a discovery of harmony, divine command, or natural law. This claim can be understood in a number of ways, with the fundamental division being between those who argue that justice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> some humans, and those who argue that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> all humans.|$|R
