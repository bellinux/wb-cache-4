(This is different from Petrov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> of spacetimes according to the algebraic properties of the Weyl tensor.) Petrov 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> contains over 100 distinct local group ations and associated invariant metrics and thus it is a non-trivial task to identify a given local group action or a given invariant metric in Petrov 2 ̆ 7 s list.

40|$|Machine {{learning}} algorithms {{to classify}} activity type from wearable accelerometers {{are important to}} improve {{our understanding of the}} relationship between physical activity (PA) and risk for physical disability in older adults. Therefore, the main objective of this dissertation was to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms to predict activity type and intensity in older adults from a commercially available accelerometer (ActiGraph GT 3 X+). In Study 1, we developed machine learning algorithms to classify activity type and intensity from raw accelerometer data in older adults. Thirty-five older adults performed an activity routine comprised of different activities (5 min/activity) while wearing three ActiGraph GT 3 X+ activity monitors (dominant hip, wrist, and ankle) and a portable metabolic system. Accelerometer and steady-state metabolic data were used to develop artificial neural network, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms (ANNLab, RFLab, and SVMLab) to predict activity type and intensity in older adults using 20 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> intervals. Classification accuracy of the models in detecting five activity categories ranged from 87 % (ANNLab hip, RFLab hip, and SVMLab hip) to 96 % (SVMLab wrist). The biases and root mean squared errors (RMSE) for predicted METs ranged from - 0. 01 MET (RMSE: 0. 54 MET) for the RFLab wrist algorithm to 0. 02 MET (RMSE: 0. 67 MET) for the ANNLab hip algorithm. Study 2 evaluated the performance of the RFLab and SVMLab algorithms for predicting activity type in free-living conditions. Fifteen participants from Study 1 were observed for 2 - 3 h in their free-living environment while wearing three ActiGraph GT 3 X+ activity monitors (dominant hip, wrist, and ankle). The RFLab and SVMLab - algorithms were applied to hip, wrist, and ankle accelerometer data to classify five activity categories. Direct observation of activity type and duration served as criterion measures to evaluate percent correct classification rates of the algorithms. Correct classification rates ranged from 49 % (SVMLab hip, SVMLab wrist, and RFLab wrist) to 55 % (SVMLab ankle). New RF and SVM algorithms were developed using free-living accelerometer data (RFFL and SVMFL) and different classification intervals were also applied. Correct classification of activity types for the RFFL and SVMFL ranged from 53 % (SVMFL wrist, 5 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> intervals) to 71 % (SVMFL ankle, 30 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> intervals). Overall correct classification rates of up to 76 % (RFFL hip and RFFL ankle, 30 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> intervals) were achieved when classifying only three activity categories. Our machine learning algorithms accurately predict activity type from accelerometer data in older adults under ‘laboratory conditions’ but not in free-living conditions. We were able to improve free-living classification accuracy using algorithms developed under free-living conditions. Further refinement of the algorithms is required for achieving sufficient accuracy in classifying activity type in free-living older adults...|$|R

Hypothesized predictors of increases or decreases in children 2 ̆ 7 s sexual behaviors included child attributes, positive parenting, exposure to sexuality and violence, maltreatment history and child welfare placement history, and treatment variables. Participants included 145 children with reported sexual behavior problems and their primary caregivers and mental healthcare providers.

Optimal Data Analysis (ODA) and multivariate classification tree analysis (CTA) via ODA were used to identify predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> status and to form subgroups of youth based on interactions between predictors. Results indicated that child functioning (i. e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and treatment variables (e. g., sex education) were significant predictors of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> status.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adequate {{antimicrobial}} {{therapy is}} a main approach employed {{to decrease the}} mortality associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). All methods that optimise empirical treatment without increasing antibiotic selective pressure are relevant. Categorisation of patients according to HAP time of onset, severity and risk factors (American Thoracic Society (ATS) classification) or duration of mechanical ventilation and prior antibiotics (Trouillet 9 <b>s</b> <b>classification)</b> are two such methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to catagorise patients with HAP according to these classifications and to determine the frequency of resistant pathogens and the most adequate antimicrobial regimens in each group. A total 124 patients with bacteriologically proven HAP were studied. The ATS classification categorised patients by increasing frequency of resistant pathogens from 0 – 30. 3 %. The ATS empirical antibiotic recommendations appeared valid but proposed combinations including vancomycin for 72. 5 % of patients. Trouillet 9 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> categorised patients into four groups with a frequency of resistant pathogens from 4. 9 – 35. 6 %. Vanomycin was proposed for 48. 5 % of patients. The American Thoracic Society classification appears to be more specific than Trouillet 9 s for predicting the absence of resistant causative pathogens in hospital-acquired pneumonia but could lead to a greater use of vanomycin. Stratification combining the two classifications is an interesting alternative...|$|R

In attempting to answer some of these questions, we must first look at what exactly occurred between Israel and Lebanon {{in the summer of}} 2006. Second, we must understand who Hezbollah is and how the group fits in with Lebanon. Third, we need to examine what kinds of rules of international humanitarian law govern both international and intra-national armed conflicts.

Only then will we be ready to investigate the various implications Hezbollah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>classification</b> has on the laws of armed conflict. This will primarily be accomplished by initially looking at which of the Geneva Conventions apply based on whether Hezbollah is a State or non-State actor.
