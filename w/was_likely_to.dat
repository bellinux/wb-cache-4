5|$|Alternatively, Taft {{wanted to}} be chief justice, and kept {{a close eye on}} the health of the aging incumbent, Melville Fuller, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft {{believed}} Fuller likely to live many years. Roosevelt had indicated he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been destroyed by a tsunami. Archaeologists {{believe that the}} second tsunami must {{have occurred in the}} 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak of the shrine have been dated to 1215.|$|E

30|$|These risks <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> further {{enhanced}} if {{the domain}} of investment is high-tech focus. Although, the FVCs possess high opportunity recognition potential with respect to high-tech domains, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> possess lower depth of local networks that guard them against information asymmetry risks (Wright et al., 2005). On the contrary although the DVCs <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> possess {{better understanding of the}} socio-cultural-institutional context, traditionally high-tech investing has not been their forte. Naturally, each of these VCs firm categories <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use different strategies to negotiate the underlying risks.|$|R

30|$|Assuming {{traditional}} gender roles, it thus {{follows that}} the combined effect of CLM and education will differ {{for men and}} women. More generally, Predictions 2 and 3 regarding education depend on whether {{men and women are}} predominantly WiHo workers or employers of WiHo. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the employer side, the more the combined effect of education and CLM on couple formation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> negative. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> WiHo workers, the less CLM <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> affect couple formation of the college-educated.|$|R

5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions.

5|$|The Temple of Tohil {{was used}} for human sacrifice, {{the bodies of the}} {{sacrificial}} victims were probably hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on a skull rack.

5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have in the household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance {{if they were the}} closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
