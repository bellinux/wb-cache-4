5|$|Due to {{its limited}} {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, {{little is known}} of its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock is covered <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi {{lights were}} again tried, this time mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, this time <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering {{much of an}} aircraft's surface.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} {{blood vessels}} called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E

5|$|On 8 July 2016, {{the club}} {{launched}} their new third away kit for the 2016–17 Premier League season. It featured in their 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign {{and was also}} use in Leicester's debut match in the competition. The design took inspiration from the 1983–84 kit, and boasts a clean white design <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> blue pinstripes on the shirt, {{as well as a}} textured form stripe design across both the shirt and shorts.|$|E
5|$|Slender <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> {{legs and}} a short tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|The oldest beds of this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has a sloping solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by awnings.|$|E

5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, <b>with</b> <b>thin,</b> dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, <b>with</b> <b>thin,</b> light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play <b>with</b> <b>Thin</b> Lizzy at any time.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent morel fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> lines. The interplay between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Ju 87s {{gave the}} German Army yet more {{valuable}} support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army {{landed on the}} Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (Kampfgruppen) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types <b>with</b> <b>thin</b> armour which were nearly all destroyed.|$|E
