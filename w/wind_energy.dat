5|$|NYU {{has made}} the {{greening}} of its campus a large priority. For example, NYU has been the largest university purchaser of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> in the U.S. since 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers Energy {{called upon}} White Construction, Inc. to {{complete}} {{the construction of the}} project. Unlike most wind farms, the turbines in the Lake <b>Winds</b> <b>Energy</b> Park are distributed throughout Mason County rather than being concentrated in a single area. This required a unique construction process. Besides finding an open area for each wind turbine, roads had to be constructed to allow access to each turbine. In addition, strict sound regulations had to be met so that the public would be willing to keep the turbines running. A phenomenon called [...] "flicker" [...] led to another design restriction. Flicker is the moving shadow that results from the motion of the wind turbine blades. The Mason County Zoning Committee required that flicker on the external wall of a dwelling could not exceed 10 total hours in a year. In order to meet this demand, the turbines in the Lake <b>Winds</b> <b>Energy</b> Park shut down {{for a short period of}} time at around midday, when maximum flicker was expected to occur. According to post-construction surveys performed in the area, the Lake <b>Winds</b> <b>Energy</b> Park met all required environmental standards related to sound and flicker.|$|R

Due to increasing hydro prices some attribute to the Green Energy Act, many Ontarians {{are turning to}} alternative sources of energy to meet their needs, such as propane and the burning of wood.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. wind {{industry}} generates tens {{of thousands}} of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity. Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land. <b>Wind</b> <b>energy</b> in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. <b>Wind</b> <b>energy</b> benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global <b>Wind</b> <b>Energy</b> Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> sector {{has become one of}} the important players in the energy markets, with the total investments reaching bn (bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>energy</b> {{penetration}} is {{the fraction}} of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation. The wind power penetration in world electric power generation in 2015 was 3.5%.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{the park}} {{became the first}} state park in North Carolina to harness the <b>wind's</b> <b>energy</b> with a <b>wind</b> turbine. The 10 kW turbine helps offset power consumption, {{producing}} approximately 700-900 kWh/month. Funding for the project came from the North Carolina Parks and Recreation Trust Fund.|$|R
50|$|The Lake <b>Winds</b> <b>Energy</b> Park {{development}} project originated from the 2008 law passed in Michigan requiring that renewable energy accounts {{for at least}} 10% of total energy production in the state by 2015. Consumers Energy presented {{the idea of creating}} a wind farm in Mason County because it was the ideal location to harness <b>wind</b> for <b>energy</b> production. This was motivated Consumer Energy's commitment to double it renewable energy production between 2007 and 2032. Construction of the wind farm began in fall of 2011 and ran until August 2012.|$|R

5|$|A British <b>Wind</b> <b>Energy</b> Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of <b>wind</b> <b>energy,</b> even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} capital intensive, {{but has no}} fuel costs. The price of wind power is {{therefore}} much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources. The marginal cost of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> once a station is constructed is usually less than 1-cent per kW·h.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

25|$|Advances {{in recent}} decades greatly lowered the cost of wind power {{making it one of}} the most {{competitive}} alternate energies and competitive with higher priced natural gas (before shale gas). <b>Wind</b> <b>energy's</b> main problem is that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source.|$|R
5|$|Wind turbine {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract <b>energy</b> from the <b>wind.</b> A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the <b>wind's</b> <b>energy,</b> point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.|$|R
5|$|Bulgaria's {{strategic}} {{geographic location}} and well-developed energy sector {{make it a}} key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Nearly 34 percent of its electricity is produced by the nuclear power station at Kozloduy and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development. The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power stations make Bulgaria {{one of the fastest-growing}} <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> producers in the world. The country aims to produce 16 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{accounted}} for 48% {{of the world}} total wind power generation capacity in 2009. In 2010, Spain became Europe's leading producer of <b>wind</b> <b>energy,</b> achieving 42,976 GWh. Germany held the top spot in Europe in terms of installed capacity, {{with a total of}} 27,215 MW as of 31 December 2010. In 2015 wind power constituted 15.6% of all installed power generation capacity in the EU and it generates around 11.4% of its power.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is the nation's third-largest {{producer}} of natural gas, fifth-largest {{producer of}} crude oil, {{and has the}} second-greatest number of active drilling rigs, and ranks fifth in crude oil reserves.

5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> production was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly.

5|$|A Carbon Trust study {{into the}} {{potential}} of small-scale <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW·h) per year of electric power (0.4% of total UK electric power consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emission savings. This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electric power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's electric power needs by 2050.|$|E
5|$|A <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} {{for different}} duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E

50|$|Lake <b>Winds</b> <b>Energy</b> Park is a {{wind farm}} located in Mason County, MI. The farm began {{production}} in August 2012 {{and is currently}} operated by Consumers Energy. It {{is home to a}} total of 56 wind turbines that produce a total of just over 100MW of energy. The turbines, which were constructed by Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc., take advantage of the western winds generated by Lake Michigan to produce power.|$|R
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
