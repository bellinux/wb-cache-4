5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo marketed a 2.5-gallon and 1-quart {{extinguisher}} using M-X liquid discharged {{through a}} low-velocity shower head type nozzle, {{but it was}} met with limited success, as it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> against Ansul's Met-L-X, {{which could be used}} on more types of metals and was non-combustible. M-X had the advantage of being easy to recharge and non-corrosive, since it was oil-based, but production did not last long due to its limited applications.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Dell did not {{emphasize}} the consumer market, {{due to the}} higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; this changed in 1996, when Dell.com reached $1 million in daily sales within 6 months of its launch. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.|$|E

25|$|On {{the high}} and windy summit of Mount Suribachi, Rosenthal {{discovered}} a group of Marines attaching a large flag to a length of steel pipe. Nearby, he saw the smaller flag flying and managed to get himself photoed by Campbell under the flag with Sgt. Genaust and Army Pfc. George Burn, a photographer for Yank Magazine. Another group of Marines was getting themselves ready to lower the smaller flag {{at the same instant}} the larger flag was raised under an officer's orders. Rosenthal briefly contemplated attempting to photograph both of the flags at once, but was not in position to get both flags in the photograph (Pvt. Campbell did capture an image of the first flag coming down while the second flag <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up),</b> so he focused his attention on the group of men preparing to raise the second flag.|$|E
500|$|According to Hitchcock, {{a series}} of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by {{assistant}} director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were [...] "no good" [...] {{because they did not}} portray [...] "an innocent person but a sinister man who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the move}} to a Friday evening timeslot, Enterprise <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> {{directly}} against episodes of Stargate SG-1 on the Sci Fi Channel. The overall ratings by Nielsen Media Research placed the show in 150th place for the season. The season opened with ratings of 2.0/4 percent {{for the first part}} of [...] "", [...] but the series lowest ratings were received for the mid season episode [...] "". Five other episodes equalled the 2.0/4 percent ratings of [...] "Storm Front" [...] while [...] "Cold Station 12", [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] each received 2.1/4 percent ratings. However, the highest ratings of the seasons were received for the series finale, [...] "These Are The Voyages...", which gained ratings of 2.4/4 percent. Rick Berman credited the falling ratings received by the series to a variety of elements saying, [...] "The show certainly had a great start. It got very good reviews and it had a huge audience for the first half a dozen episodes and then it started to slip. I could take the blame for it. I could put the blame into the scripts. I could put the blame into franchise fatigue. I don’t know why it didn’t work." ...|$|E

500|$|On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave {{an account}} of the case that contradicted the inquisitor's at almost every turn; in Rome, he said, Edgardo had been [...] "frightened, and intimidated by the rector's presence, [...] he openly {{declared}} his desire to return home with us". Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo's crib and [...] "reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die". She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour's servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism. As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, indeed saying he could not even remember Morisi. The [...] "Regina" [...] in Morisi's story was identified as Regina Bussolari; though Morisi averred to have told her the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had only spoken with Morisi [...] "once or twice, when she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to the storage room to get something", and never about {{anything to do with the}} Mortaras' children.|$|E

2500|$|In early strips, the Judges existed {{alongside}} a regular police force, were {{popular with the}} citizens, and the people enjoyed robots doing the work, with the [...] "Grand Judge" [...] saying they would not consent to work more than ten hours a week. Over time, the strip would have the Judges as a feared police-state force with sole power; prog 118 (written when unemployment <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in Britain) established that citizens resented being unemployed and took up bizarre crazes {{to deal with the}} boredom, and this remained part of the strip from then on.|$|E
50|$|VPT is {{interpreted}} in similar ways to OBV. Generally, {{the idea is}} that volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days. So, when prices <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> VPT should <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should too. If VPT fails to go past its previous rally high then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.|$|R

Despite the 17-win season, Meine quit baseball after the 1926 season. [...] He recalled, [...] "It didn't look like I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> and I just retired.

2500|$|In 1931–2, {{there were}} 100,000 Japanese farmers; other sources mention 590,760 Japanese inhabitants. Other figures for Manchukuo {{speak of a}} Japanese {{population}} 240,000 strong, later growing to 837,000. In Xinjing, they made up 25% of the population. Accordingly to the census of 1936, of the Japanese population of Manchuko, 22% were civil servants and their families; 18% were working for the South Manchurian Railroad company; 25% had come to Manchukuo to establish a business; and 21% had come to work in industry. The Japanese {{working in the fields}} of transportation, the government, and in business tended to be middle class, white collar people such as executives, engineers, and managers, and those Japanese who working in Manchukuo as blue collar employees tended to be skilled workers. In 1934, it was reported that a Japanese carpenter working in Manchukuo with its growing economy could earn twice {{as much as he could}} in Japan. With its gleaming modernist office buildings, state of the art transport networks like the famous Asia Express railroad line, and modern infrastructure that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> all over Manchukuo, Japan's newest colony become a popular tourist destination for middle-class Japanese, who wanted to see the [...] "Brave New Empire" [...] that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in the mainland of Asia. The Japanese government had official plans projecting the emigration of 5million Japanese to Manchukuo between 1936 and 1956. Between 1938 and 1942 a batch of young farmers of 200,000 arrived in Manchukuo; joining this group after 1936 were 20,000 complete families. Of the Japanese settlers in Manchukuo, almost half came from the rural areas of Kyushu. When Japan lost sea and air control of the Yellow Sea in 1943-44, this migration stopped.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, due to {{a dispute}} over {{wholesale}} prices of Coca-Cola products, Costco stopped restocking its shelves with Coke and Diet Coke for two months; a separate pouring rights deal in 2013 saw Coke products removed from Costco food courts in favor of Pepsi. Some Costco locations (such as the ones in Tucson, Arizona) additionally sell imported Coca-Cola from Mexico with cane sugar instead of corn syrup from separate distributors. [...] Coca-Cola introduced the 7.5-ounce mini-can in 2009, and on September 22, 2011, the company announced price reductions, asking retailers to sell eight-packs for $2.99. That same day, Coca-Cola announced the 12.5-ounce bottle, to sell for 89 cents. A 16-ounce bottle has sold well at 99 cents since being re-introduced, but the price <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to $1.19.|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first road trip {{of the season}} on April 7 against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. [...] Hyun-Jin Ryu made his first start since July 7, 2016, and he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> against Kyle Freeland, who was making his major league debut for the Rockies. [...] Ryu pitched 4 [...] innings, {{allowing}} two runs on six hits. [...] However, Freeland quieted the Dodgers offense, and struck out six batters, while only allowing one run in six innings as his team won the opener 2–1. The Rockies hit three home runs, including back to back blasts by Mark Reynolds and Gerardo Parra, off of Kershaw as they won 4–2 in the next game. The Dodgers avoided the sweep by beating the Rockies 10–6 in the series finale. They next traveled to Wrigley Field to play the defending champion Chicago Cubs. A walk-off single by Anthony Rizzo gave the Cubs a 3–2 win in the opener. After an off-day, the series resumed on April 12 with Brandon McCarthy and the bullpen shutting down the Cubs. Andrew Toles hit a lead-off homerun to start {{the day and the}} Dodgers made it hold up in a 2–0 victory. Addison Russell and Rizzo both homered for the Cubs as the Dodgers were unable to score off of former teammate Brett Anderson and lost 4–0 in the final game of the series.|$|E
