40|$|SWOV did {{research}} in 1976 into {{the depth of}} the tyre tread, because it was suggested in some publications that people often drove their cars with <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres</b> and because it seemed interesting to do this research just before the new law on tyre treads was layed down. The number of cars chequed was very small, so that it does not seem useful to do another investigation now to compare it with the one of 1976. furthermore there are now indications for an important change. Truck tyres were not considered...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of mechanised logging and log skidding on some components of farm tractors used under the Tractor Hiring Units (THU) of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty tractors of various makes and models were examined after a period under logging operations based on a template of eight key criteria and thirty four sub criteria related to vital tractor systems and components. Data collected were analysed to determine {{the percentage of the}} components that are good, damaged but repairable or damaged or missing parts. The results show that the highest occurrence of failure are with <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres</b> (80 %), followed by broken rear work lights, headlamps and road warning lights (60 %) and broken lateral stabilizers (53. 3 %). Similarly, the least damaged components of tractors under the study were the tyre rims (66. 7 % good), wheel hubs and axle arms (56. 7 %) and hydraulic linkage arms and forks as well as brake pedal travel and release (46. 7 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres</b> has {{obtained}} a great interest. Great efforts are therefore devoted {{to find new}} fields of application of ground tyre rubber (GTR). A method {{that has the potential}} of utilising large numbers of discarded tyres involves grinding the rubber into small particles and then reusing it as a filler in thermoplastic, thermoset and rubber compounds. However, the incorporation of GTR particles into polymer matrices significantly impairs the properties of the resulting composites. This is because of the poor matrix-filler adhesion and the lack of reactive sites on the GTR particle surface. There are several ways to 'upcycle' GTR. This thesis aimed at developing a suitable surface treatment for GTR particles by chemical modification in order to improve their compatibility with polar matrix materials. Rubbers were treated by ultraviolet light (UV) initiated grafting of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA). The viability of this grafting was first shown at unvulcanized and vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). Note that SBR is the major component in tyre mixtures. Major parameters of the grafting reaction affecting the grafting degree, the amount of undesired by-products and the crosslinking degree were studied and optimized for SBR. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis have been used for chemical characterization of the treated rubbers.

50|$|Vettel {{began to}} get closer to Alonso at this stage, diving down the outside of Turn 1 on a couple of occasions. He showed his {{frustration}} at having lost two places in the pits and at being unable to regain them when he wildly gesticulated after a Virgin got in his way whilst chasing Alonso. Throughout the final eight laps, Vettel was reminded by the team that he did not need to win the race, to win the Championship in Japan so he held position, as did teammate Webber who was in fourth. A large battle for the final points scoring positions began on lap 46, when Adrian Sutil went down the inside of 130R to pass Kobayashi for ninth. Teammate di Resta was falling back on <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres</b> though, with Vitaly Petrov taking eleventh from him only a few corners later. Petrov would then pass both Sutil and Kobayashi to finish the race in ninth place. Nico Rosberg would get ahead of both the Force Indias to claim the final points scoring position, overtaking Sutil around Dunlop on the penultimate lap. To worsen Kobayashi's race, he would eventually be taken by both Force Indias too, placing him a lowly thirteenth. Kobayashi's teammate, Sergio Pérez, made great use of a two stop strategy, by saving his tyres coming from seventeenth to eighth on race day. Force India just missed out with eleventh- and twelfth-place finishes. Lotus had a relatively successful day, finishing with both cars on the lead lap {{for the first time since}} their debut at Bahrain in 2010. This completed the most cars on the lead lap of a race ever, in Formula One.|$|R
40|$|Approximately 60 000 tonnes of tyres are {{produced}} annually in Sweden to meet thedemand in the market. It {{is believed that}} 10 000 tonnes of rubber particles contaminatesthe Swedish roads every year. Some of the elements in the emitted particles cannegatively impact the environment. These elements can lead to leaching in water thatcan cause serious problems to aquatic organisms. Furthermore <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres</b> negativelyinfluence the driving dynamics. It {{increases the risk of}} aquaplaning which can have fatalconsequences. Innovative ways of recycling tyres are constantly being developed butstill faces major challenges. It is therefore important to understand tyre wear, whatinfluences it and how to reduce it. The aim of the project is to acquire knowledge related to tyre wear, its environmentalimpacts, use a mathematical model to simulate tyre wear and study how the differentparameters influences wear. First a literature survey was performed to acquire knowledge related to tyre wear. It wasfound that tyre wear is mainly due to adhesive and hysteresis wear. Several factors werefound to affect tyre wear for example velocity, slip angle and the type of road surface. The environment impact was also studied and the results show the composition of theparticles emitted to the environment. Some of the emitted particles negatively affect theaquatic organism and human beings. In {{the second part of the}} project a mathematical model based on the well-known brushtyre model was used to simulate how wear changes with different parameters. Themodel created at KTH Vehicle Dynamics is named the expanded brush tyre model(EBM). The wear model chosen for this evaluation was the Archards wear law. Thismodel was used to be able to quantify wear and study how it is influenced by differentfactors. The result of the mathematical models shows clearly an exponential increase in thevolume of wear with increases in velocity, slip angle and vertical load. The analysis wasdone using zero camber angle. For future work it is recommended to investigate camber angle as it is also one of themajor factors that affects wear. Temperature is also another factor that was not taken into account in the study. It can also be studied in future work...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the role of traditional aquaculture systems and fish in food security and livelihoods of fishing communities in two states in Nigeria. The research focused on the productivity, sustainability and profitability of the aquaculture systems including social and economic conditions of farmers. The study also compared {{the relative importance of}} fish as a high quality protein source with meats in fishing communities in two states in Nigeria. Data were collected from 400 farmers with modern and traditional aquaculture systems in Niger and Lagos states using semi-structured questionnaires. Modern aquaculture consisted of small fish ponds with an average size of 0. 1 ha. Liming was not widespread among farmers with fish ponds but fertilisation was done before stocking by applying fertilisers of both organic and inorganic origins. Farmers (90 %) obtained their seeds from the hatcheries and the average stocking density was 5730 ha- 1. Polyculture was widely practised by farmers and local feeds were used in feeding fish. Fish shelters and fish fences were the traditional aquaculture systems that were widely practised in two states in Nigeria and are poorly researched and recorded. Various materials were used in the construction of traditional aquaculture systems including branches, elephant grasses, <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tyres,</b> PVC pipes and clay pots and, were constructed in order to aggregate fish. There was no significant (p > 0. 05) difference in yield of fish from fish parks and modern aquaculture systems. The study showed that fishermen prefer fishing in the vicinity of fish parks, tube shelters and fish fences because they make more catches around the installations. Cost–benefit analysis showed that traditional aquaculture systems are profitable because the level of investment required to set and maintain them is quite low compared to returns obtained from them. Fifty actively fishing and fifty non–fishing households in traditional fishing communities were randomly selected in Niger and Lagos states for fish consumption survey. A Simple scale was designed and given to each household to measure fish or meat entering the household for consumption. Intra household fish distribution and consumption was obtained by 24 hour recall method. A large number of fish species were consumed in the fishing communities confirming the relative abundance of the species in local rivers, floodplains and lagoons. Tilapia was the most consumed fish species contributing 19 and 32 % by weight of the fish consumed in Niger and Lagos state, respectively. Beef was the most consumed meat followed by goat meat. The study reveals high preference for fresh fish and meat. Highest fish consumption occurred in March corresponding to period of lowest meat consumption. Traditional aquaculture systems and capture fisheries were the main sources of fish in the fishing communities contributing 85 % by weight to fish consumed. Male heads of households consumed higher amount of fish than other members of the household. Average weight of fish consumed per person per day was 24 g. Fish contributed 77 % to total animal protein in diet of the people and was eaten daily by fishermen thus confirming the importance of fish in the food security of fishing communities.

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. Leimer revealed that his objective for the feature race was to execute a fast getaway off the line, {{but in spite of}} struggling which almost lost him a position to Coletti, he declared himself [...] "very happy" [...] as he had waited for some time to win another race in the GP2 Series. When asked if he was not worried about heavy overtaking and tyre management, he replied yes, [...] "but I was much quicker than them so I was not using my tyres that much. It’s not the perfect situation for the tyres, but I still managed to save them." [...] Coletti spoke of his happiness over the job performed by his team but felt he could have pushed harder earlier in the race due to the fear of <b>wearing</b> his <b>tyres</b> <b>out</b> and thus elected to not take the risk. He stated that he did not inform his team that he observed Leimer entering the pit lane on the same lap as him and now believed he could have remained on track for one additional lap. Rossi revealed his apprehension about how his tyres would behave and was uncertain on how to push it. Nevertheless, he praised the effort his team put into the event and spoke of his happiness of finishing in third place.|$|R

50|$|There can be {{numerous}} {{causes of}} leaks. Leaks can occur {{from the outset}} even during construction or initial manufacture/assembly of fluid systems. Pipes, tubing, valves, fittings, or other components may be improperly joined or welded together. Components with threads may be improperly screwed together. Leaks {{can be caused by}} damage; for example, punctures or fracture. Often leaks are the result of deterioration of materials from wear or aging, such as rusting or other corrosion or decomposition of elastomers or similar polymer materials used as gaskets or other seals. For example, <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> of faucet washers causes water to leak at the faucets. Cracks may result from either outright damage, or <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> by stress such as fatigue failure or corrosion such as stress corrosion cracking. <b>Wearing</b> <b>out</b> of a surface between a disk and its seat in a valve could cause a leak between ports (valve inlets or outlets). <b>Wearing</b> <b>out</b> of packing around a turning valve stem or rotating centrifugal pump shaft could develop into fluid outleakage into the environment. For some frequently operating centrifugal pumps, such leakage is so expected that provisions are made for carrying away the leakage. Similarly, <b>wearing</b> <b>out</b> of seals or packing around piston-driven pumps could also develop into outleakage to the environment.|$|R
