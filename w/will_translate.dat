25|$|Immunity against {{infections that}} can cause serious illness is {{generally}} beneficial. Since Pasteur provided support for a germ theory of infectious disease, we have increasingly induced immunity against a widening range of diseases to prevent the associated risks from the wild infections. It is hoped that further understanding of the molecular basis of immunity <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> to improved clinical practice in the future.|$|E
25|$|As the {{throttle}} is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate {{to the prime}} mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on {{the requirements of the}} train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved {{the throttle}} to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{received}} {{the influence of}} American individualist anarchism but most importantly it {{was related to the}} French currents. At the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain takes force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales and J. Elizalde who <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as La Idea Libre, La revista blanca, Etica, Iniciales, Al margen and Nosotros. In Germany the Scottish-German John Henry McKay became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, stirnerist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. Brand published a German homosexual periodical, Der Eigene in 1896. The Irish anarchist writer of the Decadent movement Oscar Wilde influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore and gained the admiration of Benjamin Tucker.|$|E

25|$|While {{toxicokinetics}} {{describes the}} changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, biotransformation, distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity binding sites increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain tissues or organs. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> into effects at higher levels of organization.|$|E
25|$|It is now common {{place for}} retail stores (mostly jewellery, {{silverware}} or award stores) {{to have a}} small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator {{and the ability to}} do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.|$|E
500|$|Hasbro and Hub Network (prior to its {{rebranding}} as Discovery Family) {{have also}} sought to market to bronies. Steiner said, [...] "You develop the best show you can, and hope the humour <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> to a broader audience. But I've {{been in the business}} for 25 years and I've never seen anything like this." [...] A company spokeswoman said that bronies are [...] "a small group of My Little Pony fans who don't necessarily fit what one might expect to be the brand's target audience", while its core audience in the older market is predominantly females. Despite the bronies being an unusual and unexpected audience, Hasbro and Hub Network chose to [...] "salute and embrace all the viewers who have embraced our brand", according to Margaret Loesch, CEO of Hub Network and former executive producer of the original My Little Pony animated series. Hasbro has allowed the fandom to be an organic movement leading to its growth and success, according to Stephen Davis, head of Hasbro Studios.|$|E

[...] In fact, Max Havelaar has been translated into thirty-four languages. It was first translated into English in 1868. In Indonesia, the novel was cited as an inspiration by Sukarno and other early nationalist leaders, such as the author's Indo (Eurasian) descendant Ernest Douwes Dekker, who had read it in its original Dutch. It was not translated into Indonesian until 1972.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2005, Harvard University President Lawrence Summers sparked {{controversy}} when, at an NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science & Engineering Workforce, he made comments {{suggesting the}} lower {{numbers of women}} in high-level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women. He noted the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) on tests of cognitive abilities, leading to proportionally {{more men than women}} at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions. In his discussion of this, Summers said that [...] "even small differences in the standard deviation [...] <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the test differs for {{asserted}} cases of likelihood of confusion. The Federal Circuit has recently clarified {{the applicability of the}} doctrine of foreign equivalents in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that [...] "When it is unlikely that an American buyer <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied". The court noted that [...] "the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline". Instead [...] "he doctrine should be applied only when {{it is likely that the}} ordinary American purchaser would [...] "stop and translate [...] into its English equivalent". The Federal Circuit specifically found that [...] "it is improbable that the average American purchaser would stop and translate '' into 'widow'".|$|E
2500|$|The second hypothesis, the {{generally}} greater variability among men (compared to women) in tests of cognitive abilities, leading to proportionally more males than females {{at both the}} lower and upper tails of the test score distributions, caused the most controversy. [...] In his discussion of this hypothesis, Summers said that [...] "even small differences in the standard deviation [...] <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [...] ". [...] Summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations {{of males and females}} in the top 5% of twelfth graders under various tests. [...] He then went on to argue that, if this research were to be accepted, then [...] "whatever the set of attributes... that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at MIT or being a chemist at Berkeley... are probably different in their standard deviations as well".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second issue}} also {{affected}} Churchill's reputation. On 16 April 1934 Churchill claimed in Parliament that Sir Samuel Hoare and Lord Derby had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to change evidence it {{had given to}} the Joint Select Committee considering the Government of India Bill in June 1933. On 18 April he successfully moved that the matter be referred to the House of Commons Privilege Committee. He tried to cross-examine witnesses before the Committee, contrary to normal procedure. Churchill himself gave evidence and Austen Chamberlain criticised {{the manner in which}} he gave it. Churchill's evidence was little and the inquiry reported to the House that there had been no breach. The report was debated on 13 June. Churchill was unable to find a single supporter in the House and the debate ended without a division. Leo Amery accused him of pressing the matter to bring the government down stating [...] "at all costs he had to be faithful to his chosen motto:'Fiat justicia, ruat caelum." [...] Churchill responded [...] "Translate it!" [...] Amery then remarked [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> it into the vernacular: 'If I can trip up Sam [...] the government's bust'." ...|$|E

50|$|While in Cadiz on the Sultan's business, Herrera is {{supposed}} to have been captured by the English, was released again after an exchange of diplomatic correspondence between the Sultan and Queen Elizabeth I, and travelled thereafter to Amsterdam, where he returned to Judaism. His date of death is between 1635 and 1639: Wiener believes it was 1635. According to Rodriguez de Castro he may have died in Vienna. He wrote several works, originally in Spanish but later (in accordance with his <b>will)</b> <b>translated</b> to Hebrew.|$|R
2500|$|The Statute of the Court and TFEU require {{judges are}} {{appointed}} {{only if they}} have no political occupation, with independence [...] "beyond doubt". They are selected for renewable six-year terms by [...] "common accord" [...] of governments, with the advice of seven EU or member state judges that the Council and Parliament selects. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, article 11, says the court is usually organised into chambers of 3 or 5 judges each. A [...] "grand chamber" [...] of 15 more senior judges sit on questions of [...] "difficulty or importance", or those requested by member states. The court's President and Vice-President are elected by other judges for renewable 3-year terms by secret ballot. Judges can only be dismissed if all other judges and Advocate Generals unanimously agree. Advocate Generals are appointed by the court to give reasoned submissions on cases, especially involving new points of law. Unlike judges on the Court, they write opinions as themselves, rather than collectively, and often with a command of prose and reason, and while not binding are often followed in practice. In addition, each judge has secretaries or referendaires who research and write. Unlike the UK where judges always write their own opinions, referendaires often assist drafting the judgments in the Court of Justice. The Court's Translation Directorate <b>will</b> <b>translate</b> every final judgment into the 24 official languages of the European Union. The three main kinds of judgments the Court of Justice gives following (1) preliminary rulings, requested by the courts of member states, (2) enforcement actions, brought by the Commission or Member States, against the EU, a member state, or any other party that is alleged to violate EU law, and (3) other direct actions, where the EU or member state is involved as {{a party to the}} dispute, and gives final rulings. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, modelled on the International Court of Justice, begin with submission of written cases to the court, followed by a short oral hearing. In each case a judge is designated to actively manage the hearing (called a rapporteur) and draft the judgment (probably with help from referendaires). The court always deliberates and votes before the final opinion is written and published. Cases in the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice on points of law. While there is no formal appeal procedure from the Court of Justice, in practice its actions are subject to scrutiny by both the supreme courts of member states and the European Court of Human Rights, even if the final balance of power is unresolved.|$|E
