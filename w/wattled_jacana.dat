50|$|Jacana is {{the genus}} {{comprising}} the two jacanas of the Americas: the northern jacana, Jacana spinosa, and the <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana,</b> Jacana jacana.|$|E
50|$|Together {{the species}} occur in marshes in the American tropics and subtropics. The {{northern}} jacana's range meets {{that of the}} <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> in western Panama.|$|E

50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana's</b> food is insects, other {{invertebrates}} {{and seeds}} picked from the floating vegetation or the water’s surface.|$|R
50|$|Bird: Bird {{species are}} {{typically}} biparental in care, {{and may also}} be maternal like the Guianan cock-of-the-rocks. However the reverse may also hold true. Male <b>wattled</b> <b>jacanas</b> provide all parental care after the eggs have been laid by the females. This means that the males must incubate the eggs and defend the nest {{for an extended period}} of time. Since males invest much more time and energy into the offspring, females are very competitive for the right to lay their eggs in an established nest.|$|R
50|$|The APA lacks {{surveillance}} and management tools.Issues include construction of fish farming tanks, accumulation {{of solid waste}} and predatory hunting of <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> and American purple gallinule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> (Jacana jacana) is a wader {{which is}} a {{resident}} breeder from western Panama and Trinidad south through most of South America east of the Andes.|$|E
50|$|Rare and {{endangered}} fauna include scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> (Jacana jacana), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), {{green sea turtle}} (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|E
25|$|Multiple mating is {{also seen}} in <b>wattled</b> <b>jacanas</b> where females {{have a group}} of males close by for mating. Copulations are easily seen in jacanas facilitating the {{observation}} of females copulating continuously with various males. The continuous copulations and the close proximity to mates have allowed the females to fly in within minutes leading to the expected sperm mixing and allowing the most viable sperm to fertilize most of the clutch or to increase genetic diversity for benefits in disease resistance. Snow and Andrade (2005) concluded that the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) increases their ability to manipulate the paternity of their offspring by using the spermathecae to store multiple sperms. Additionally, a study on leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex echinatior) supported the hypothesis that sperm mixing indeed occurs in polyandrous social insects. It was further found that the eggs in the queen ants showed to be completely mixed and used randomly during egg laying.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{from the}} reserve include the fulvous whistling duck, blue-winged teal, osprey, <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana,</b> black-necked stilt, cocoi heron, striated heron, anhinga and neotropic cormorant. Of special interest are the grayish piculet, apical flycatcher, bar-crested antshrike and the scrub tanager. The reserve also supports {{the only remaining}} population of the horned screamer in the region.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{adapted to}} the {{mangrove}} environment include orange-winged amazon (Amazona amazonica), cocoi heron (Ardea cocoi), rufous crab hawk (Buteogallus aequinoctialis), striated heron (Butorides striata), semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), great egret (Ardea alba), green kingfisher (Chloroceryle americana), bicolored conebill (Conirostrum bicolor), greater ani (Crotophaga major), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> (Jacana jacana).|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> lays four black-marked brown {{eggs in a}} {{floating}} nest. The male, as with other jacanas and some other wader families like the phalaropes, takes responsibility for incubation, with two eggs held between each wing and the breast. The females are polyandrous and will help to defend the nests of up to four mates.|$|E
50|$|Eight {{species of}} jacana are known from six genera. The fossil record {{of this family}} is {{restricted}} to a recent fossil of the <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> from Brazil and a Pliocene fossil of an extinct species, Jacana farrandi, from Florida. A fossil from Miocene rocks in the Czech Republic was assigned to this family, but more recent analysis disputes the placement and moves the species to the Coraciidae.|$|E
50|$|In 1870, {{the borough}} {{was known as}} Uroguapira because {{it was thought that}} there was gold (Portuguese ouro) in the area. As this was only a rumor, the name given by the {{aboriginal}} people for the region of the Cantareira was shortened to Guapira. On 1 June 1930, the name of the borough was changed to Jaçanã (a bird known in English as the <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana).</b>|$|E
50|$|Threatened and {{vulnerable}} species include West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> (Jacana jacana) and American purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica).Other bird species include striated heron (Butorides striata), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), great egret (Ardea alba), ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata), blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and white-winged swallow (Tachycineta albiventer).|$|E

50|$|The lagoon {{has many}} caxeta trees, a light wood {{used to make}} wooden shoes, pencils, wooden spoons and craft items.The lagoon has {{abundant}} fish, and is the largest breeding place for marine life in Guaratuba Bay.It forms an environment like the Pantanal, where birds and small animals forage.It {{is said to be}} the area with greatest biodiversity on the coast of Paraná.Capybaras may be seen in the lagoon.Other animals are broad-snouted caiman, lowland paca and common agouti, as well as birds such as herons, ducks and neotropic cormorants.The <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> is a common bird in the ponds and swamps of Brazil.The marsh antwren is rare and considered endangered, a small creeping species identified only recently.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} very similar to each other: about 22 cm long, with long necks and fairly long yellow bills. Adults are black and chestnut-brown, with pale yellow-green flight {{feathers}} that contrast conspicuously when a bird flies. Their legs are long and grayish, and as in all jacanas, their toes are extremely long, for walking on aquatic vegetation such as lily pads. They have frontal shields (like those of coots) and wattles; differences in these are the most noticeable differences between the species. Juveniles are brown above and white below, with a buff-white stripe above the eye and a dark stripe behind it. The dark colors are somewhat darker on the juvenile <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> than on the northern.|$|E
5000|$|Females {{are also}} known to display infanticidal behavior. This may appear unexpected, as the {{conditions}} described above do not apply. Males {{are not always}} an unlimited resource though - in some species, males provide parental care to their offspring, and females may compete indirectly with others by killing their offspring, freeing up the limiting resource that the males represent. This has been documented in research by Stephen Emlen and Natalie Demong on wattled jacanas (Jacana jacana), a tropical wading bird. In the <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana,</b> it is exclusively the male sex that broods, while females defend their territory. In this experiment Demong and Emlen found that removing females from a territory resulted in nearby females attacking the chicks of the male in most cases, evicting them from their nest. The males then fertilized the offending females and cared for their young. Emlen describes how he [...] "shot a female one night, and ... by first light a new female {{was already on the}} turf. I saw terrible things - pecking and picking up and throwing down chicks until they were dead. Within hours she was soliciting the male, and he was mounting her the same day. The next night I shot the other female, then came out the next morning and saw the whole thing again." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{foraging}} strategies implies {{an attempt at}} gaining energy by predators. Supposedly, the difference in employing the "sit and wait" or "active foraging" behavior lays in hunter skills, experience {{and the kind of}} prey consumed. With the hypothesis that "active foraging" demands no learning, in this study we compared the prey capture efficiency among <b>Wattled</b> <b>Jacana</b> juveniles and adults, and also present descriptive information about feeding habitat and the abundance variation of foragers throughout the day in the northern Pantanal. Prey capture efficiency did not differ significantly among juveniles and adults, corroborating our initial hypothesis that "active foraging" is an instinctive behavior and demands no experience to be effective. However, future work is necessary to compare the energetic quality of consumed items by juveniles and adults, searching for differences explained by adults' experience. Foraging individuals were found at an average distance of 14 m ranging from 2 to 42 m) from the margin of the sampled swamps, however 64 % of the foragers were found closer to the margins. The average depth of foraging sites was 17 cm, ranging from 5 to 40 cm, although no preference for specific classes of depth was found (p > 0, 05). Despite the accepted general pattern of birds being more active in the early morning, the largest number of individuals foraging was observed between 11 : 00 and 12 : 00 AM, but no significant difference was found in the abundance of foraging individuals among different periods of the day. Factors, which were not analyzed, such as food availability and presence of competitors and predators need to be studied to reveal the main factors of the spatial and temporal distribution of the <b>Wattled</b> <b>Jacana.</b> Nucleo de Estudos Ecologicos do Pantanal/UFMT/Ministerio de Ciencias e TecnologiaNucleo de Estudos Ecologicos do Pantanal/UFMT/Ministerio de Ciencias e TecnologiaCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes) Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) Universidade Federal de Mato GrossoUniversidade Federal de Mato Gross...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide the first {{molecular}} genetic data on extra-pair paternity in a simultaneously polyandrous, sex-role-reversed avian species, the <b>wattled</b> <b>jacana</b> (Jacana jacana). Female jacanas often copulated with multiple mates, {{provided that the}} mates were not actively incubating eggs or tending young chicks. Both the presence of multiple 'available' mates, and the copulation behaviour of the female near the time of nest initiation, significantly predicted the probability of extra-pair fertilizations. A male's risk of being cuckolded was 0 % in monandrous pairings, rose to 41 % of broods (17 % of chicks) in polyandrous associations where an additional mate was 'available', and increased to 74 % of broods (29 % of chicks) where the female was observed to copulate with multiple mates. Unlike findings from several sequentially polyandrous bird species, few if any fertilizations resulted from sperm stored from a previous nesting. We conclude that lost paternity can constitute a very real cost of polyandry for male wattled jacanas. The source of this cost is sexually active males simultaneously paired to the same female...|$|E
40|$|Some {{bird species}} feed on {{external}} parasites, such as ticks and flies, {{on the body}} of mammals (hosts or clients). So called cleaner birds that occur in Brazil were reviewed recently, but gathering of significant new data indicates the need for an update and a brief reappraisal of such association. New records raise the number of known clients for some cleaning birds. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus) picks ticks on cattle, and the Black Caracara (Daptrius ater) picks ticks on capybaras. The <b>Wattled</b> <b>Jacana</b> (Jacana jacana) picks ticks, horseflies, arthropods and organic debris on capybaras, and tick-picking on capybaras by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is substantiated by photographs. The Cattle Tyrant (Machetornis rixosa) deftly catches horseflies on capybaras, and these latter clients are recorded posing for the Giant Cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus), which also pick parasites from the marsh deer. The Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) definitely picks ticks directly on cattle. With the new records, some poorly documented or controversial issues in the literature are here confirmed, a hypothesis is validated, and a suggestion is invalidated...|$|E
