So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a tree that Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds {{talked to}} St. Louis about {{acquiring}} Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games {{and finished with}} 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players {{had served as a}} union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group's new league was attempting to compete with established baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone. Frey {{recovered}} the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule {{it would have been}} a touchback and the Huskies <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E

The troops questioned voters, examined ballot boxes, and made several arrests. These actions were in direct violation of a restraining order issued by circuit court judge James M. Gilbert, but Denhardt claimed to be acting on orders from Laffoon. Denhardt later reported that [...] "We stopped the most stupendous, well-planned election steal ever attempted in Kentucky. Chandler <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> 15,000 votes had we not been here." [...] Denhardt was later arrested and charged with contempt of court for violating the restraining order.|$|E

She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour.

[...] While they thought that the message was heavy-handed, it {{was the type of}} stories that Enterprise should have been {{covering}} all along. They gave [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] a score of four out of five. Jay Garmon, whilst compiling a list of the best episodes of Enterprise, listed [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] as the third best. He thought that Peter Weller [...] "stole the show", and that it created a [...] "solid conclusion" [...] to the show despite the following episode, [...] "These Are the Voyages...".

500|$|During Greenwalt's {{restructuring}} of the pilot, all of the original actors save for the male lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. Joel Silver approached Dohring [...] "out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef, and was interested by the character's [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "sharp" [...] personality. Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not sure if he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end".|$|E

They continue to enjoy each other's company until Susan tells Ellen that she's gay and that she thought Ellen might be too. Ellen denies it and suggests that Susan is trying to [...] "recruit" [...] her. Susan sarcastically says that she'll have to call [...] "national headquarters" [...] and let them know Ellen got away. ("Damn, just one more and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> that toaster oven.")

Believe it or not, {{there are still a lot}} of different interpretations that make it uncomfortable some during a ballgame." [...] Less supportive of Oklahoma was Bob Knight, head basketball coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders. [...] Knight had called for Oklahoma to forfeit its basketball game against Tech in 2003, when the Sooners won 69–64 because of two bad timekeeping decisions. The controversial Knight stated [...] "...ad Oklahoma forfeited that game against us like I suggested, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> far more positive publicity out of that than if they had gone to the Final Four that year.

Dohring {{had to go through}} the normal audition process and was not sure if he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the role without Silver, who had [...] "pushed it all the way through to the end". Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was [...] "to lighten the show up a bit". He believed the changes granted the studio's and network's wish to [...] "make it a little younger and hipper". O'Laughlin felt that the whole cast's becoming [...] "a little bit younger" [...] especially effected the character Josef, as the originally chosen actor, Šerbedžija, was twice Jason Dohring's age. The creators and the network were concerned that Josef, whose relationship with Mick was important, would appear as more of a [...] "father figure" [...] rather than as a friend. O'Laughlin supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting [...] "level of ease in that age difference".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the videos on the Internet, this has not {{translated}} into sales for the album Of the Blue Colour of the Sky which the song is a part of, selling only 40,000 copies since its January release. Part of this is attributed to the [...] "unremarkable" [...] music on the album and for the video; musician Max Tundra suggested that the band should [...] "record an innovative, exciting piece of music – and make a plodding, nondescript video to go with it." [...] However, ticket sales for OK Go concerts have seen a surge since the video's release, as well as sales of digital downloads of the song through services like iTunes. According to Nordwind, the band is not concerned with album sales, as their successes have come from [...] "untraditional ways" [...] through the band's career. Kulash has stated that with the continued success of their music videos as viral videos as was the case for [...] "This Too Shall Pass", the band has seen more touring opportunities and an expanded audience they don't believe they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> with more traditional videos under corporate label control. This has led OK Go to [...] "look at making videos like [...] look at making records — it's part of the art of what [...] do", according to Nordwind. In part of {{the success of}} [...] "This Too Shall Pass" [...] and their previous videos, OK Go won the 14th Annual Webby Special Achievement Award for Film and Video Artist of the Year.

500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson."
