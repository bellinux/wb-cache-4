Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and bakelite, fold-away Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Branford is {{the first}} {{previously}} rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform. A $60 million bond in February 2011 included $16.5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford, $7.3 million for platform extensions at Guilford, and $11 million to add catenary <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> currently unwired sidings along the line. Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013, and the Guilford work is under way as well. After delays, the enlarged Branford station opened on September 30, 2016, although the north platform was not immediately served by trains. Bidding on a second platform and three-level parking garage at Madison, planned since 2009, was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur. Per the agreement with Amtrak, a second platform is planned {{to be added to}} Clinton station. The project was originally planned to start in early 2012, but has since been indefinitely delayed.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E

5000|$|A strain {{insulator}} is an electrical insulator {{that is designed}} to work in mechanical tension (strain), to withstand the pull of a suspended electrical wire or cable. They are used in overhead electrical <b>wiring,</b> <b>to</b> support radio antennas and overhead power lines. A {{strain insulator}} may be inserted between two lengths of <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> isolate them electrically from each other while maintaining a mechanical connection, or where a <b>wire</b> attaches <b>to</b> a pole or tower, to transmit the pull of the <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> the support while insulating it electrically. Strain insulators were first used in telegraph systems in the mid 19th century.|$|R

5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> the fixed conventional landing gear and landing <b>wires</b> <b>to</b> the upper fuselage.|$|E
