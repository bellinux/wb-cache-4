The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts.

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that <b>would</b> <b>offer</b> armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government <b>would</b> <b>offer</b> little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|Maxinquaye is the 1995 {{debut album}} by English rapper and {{producer}} Tricky. By {{the time he}} recorded the album, Tricky had grown frustrated with his limited role in the group Massive Attack and discovered vocalist Martina Topley-Bird, who he felt <b>would</b> <b>offer</b> another dimension to his lyrics. He signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way Records in 1993 and recorded Maxinquaye the following year primarily at his home studio in London with Topley-Bird as the album's predominant vocalist.

5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who <b>would</b> <b>offer</b> to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
