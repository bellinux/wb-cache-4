5|$|Foram dissolution: Foraminifera tests {{appear to}} be more eroded during H3 and H6 (Gwiazda et al., 1996). That may {{indicate}} an influx of nutrient-rich, hence corrosive, Antarctic Bottom <b>Water</b> <b>by</b> a reconfiguration of oceanic circulation patterns.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{also worked}} in Bacton, Norfolk, further up the coast, where night-flying was {{conducted}} {{and was later}} involved in supporting anti-submarine patrols. A typical patrol would {{last two or three}} days and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a seaplane {{in and out of the}} <b>water</b> <b>by</b> means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E
5|$|An air well or aerial well is a {{structure}} or device that collects <b>water</b> <b>by</b> promoting the condensation of moisture from air. Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, require no external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.|$|E

5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the <b>water</b> <b>by</b> two cranes mounted {{on either side of}} the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% <b>water</b> <b>by</b> weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{water is}} a form of water that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water. Deuterium was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931 and he was later able to concentrate it in water. His mentor Gilbert Newton Lewis isolated the first sample of pure heavy <b>water</b> <b>by</b> electrolysis in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose <b>water</b> <b>by</b> electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|In a 100g amount, {{maple syrup}} {{provides}} 260 calories and {{is composed of}} 32% <b>water</b> <b>by</b> weight, 67% carbohydrates (90% of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.|$|E

5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under <b>water</b> <b>by</b> switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|Soap bubbles {{have very}} large surface areas {{with very little}} mass. Bubbles in pure water are unstable. The {{addition}} of surfactants, however, can have a stabilizing effect on the bubbles (see Marangoni effect). Note that surfactants actually reduce the surface tension of <b>water</b> <b>by</b> a factor of three or more.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled trolleys running on Décauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck {{at the rear of}} the ship. The torpedo bombers would be moved to the quarterdeck where their wings would be extended and then they would be lowered into the <b>water</b> <b>by</b> the large crane at the very stern of the ship.|$|E

5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish <b>water</b> <b>by</b> Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton <b>Water,</b> <b>by</b> the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} Bureau of Standards, Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the anomalous sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had been separated from <b>water</b> <b>by</b> electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{landmark in}} Fleet Street {{during the late}} Middle Ages was a conduit {{that was the main}} water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the conduit flowed wine instead of <b>water.</b> <b>By</b> the 16th century, Fleet Street, along with much of the City, was chronically overcrowded, and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.|$|E
5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal <b>water</b> <b>by</b> passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the <b>water,</b> <b>by</b> lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
