Her father, Juan Duarte, was descended from French Basque immigrants, meanwhile her mother Juana Ibarguren, was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants. Juan Duarte, a wealthy rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, {{already had a}} <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> there. At that time in rural Argentina, {{it was not uncommon}} for a wealthy man to have multiple families.|$|E

5|$|In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris {{from his}} house at Égreville to see his doctor. The {{composer}} had been suffering from abdominal cancer for some months, but his symptoms did not seem imminently life-threatening. Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> hastened to Paris, and were {{with him when he}} died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with no music, was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.|$|E

5|$|The CIA used {{surveillance}} {{photos and}} intelligence reports {{to determine the}} identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden. Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} as a farmer, Jansch left his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> and {{returned}} to music, although Jansch and his wife would not be formally divorced until 1988. In 1977, he recorded the album A Rare Conundrum with {{a new set of}} musicians: Mike Piggott, Rod Clements and Pick Withers. He then formed the band Conundrum with the addition of Martin Jenkins (violin) and Nigel Smith (bass). They spent six months touring Australia, Japan and the United States. With the end of the tour, Conundrum parted company and Jansch spent six months in the United States, where he recorded the Heartbreak album with Albert Lee.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as he believed it was easier to make visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev rarely {{appeared}} in public during 1982. The Soviet government claimed that Brezhnev was not seriously ill, but {{admitted that he}} was surrounded by doctors. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office. On 7 November 1982, despite his failing health, Brezhnev was present standing on Lenin's Mausoleum during the annual military parade and demonstration of workers commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. The event would also mark Brezhnev's final public appearance before dying three days later after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral, which was followed with a five-day period of nationwide mourning. He was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square. National and international statesmen from around the globe attended his funeral. His <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> attended; his daughter Galina Brezhneva outraged spectators by not showing up in sombre garb. Brezhnev on the other hand was dressed for burial in his Marshal's uniform, along with all his medals.|$|E

Wartime propaganda claimed that soldiers' families were being well looked after.

5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family,</b> and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E
5|$|In {{four months}} in Korea, Davis had scored 14 {{confirmed}} victories, 1 probable victory and 2 aircraft damaged, bringing his career total victory count to 21. By {{the end of the}} war, he was ranked fourth among pilots, surpassed by Joseph C. McConnell, James Jabara, and Manuel J. Fernandez, after his death. Immediately following word of the mission, fellow ace Colonel Harrison Thyng, commander of the 4th Wing, recommended Davis for the Medal of Honor. On April 15, 1953, Davis was posthumously promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Davis' cenotaph is located in the City of Lubbock Cemetery in Lubbock, Texas. Also buried at this cemetery is musician Buddy Holly and Medal of Honor recipient Herman C. Wallace. In April 1953, Davis' <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family</b> received his Medal of Honor from Air Force Chief of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock.|$|E
5|$|Around 1871 Nathalie {{took the}} {{children}} and left her husband for Trophimowsky, who had abandoned his own <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family.</b> They left Russia, staying in Turkey and then Italy before settling in Geneva. Around 1872 Nathalie gave birth to Augustin; deMoerder, who came to Switzerland in a failed attempt to reconcile with Nathalie, accepted the son as his own and allowed him to have his surname, but the boy's older siblings believed that Trophimowsky was the father. General deMoerder died several months later, and despite their separation had arranged for his estate to pay Nathalie a considerable regular income. The family remained in Switzerland. Four years later Eberhardt was born, and was registered as Nathalie's illegitimate daughter. Biographer Françoise d'Eaubonne speculated that Eberhardt's biological father was the poet Arthur Rimbaud, {{who had been in}} Switzerland at the time. Other historians consider this unlikely and find it more likely that Tromphimowsky was the father, noting that Nathalie and Trophimowsky were rarely apart, that Eberhardt's birth did not impact negatively on their partnership, and that Eberhardt was Trophimowsky's favorite child. Biographer Cecily Mackworth speculated that Eberhardt's illegitimacy was due to Tromphimowsky's nihilist beliefs, which rejected traditional concepts of family.|$|E

5|$|The text {{virtually}} ignores his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family,</b> but Cibber {{wrote in}} detail about {{his time in}} the theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The Apology is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry {{at the end of their}} careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.|$|E
5|$|William Burke {{was born}} in 1792 in Urney, County Tyrone, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a {{comfortable}} upbringing, and both joined the army as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal Militia, until he met and married a woman from County Mayo, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>family.</b> He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the Union Canal. He settled in the small village of Maddiston near Falkirk, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became hawkers, selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a cobbler, a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a Roman Catholic, Burke became a regular worshiper at Presbyterian religious meetings held in Grassmarket; he was seldom seen without a bible.|$|E
