5|$|Madagascar's central {{highlands}} {{were first}} inhabited between 200 BCE–300 CE by the island's earliest settlers, the Vazimba, <b>who</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have arrived by pirogue from southeastern Borneo and established simple {{villages in the}} island's dense forests. By the 15th century the Merina ethnic group from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among existing Vazimba settlements ruled by local kings. In the mid-16th century these royal Merina villages (rovas)—now fortified with stone walls, gateways and deep defensive trenches—were united {{under the rule of}} King Andriamanelo (1540–1575), who initiated the first military campaigns to expel or assimilate the Vazimba population by force. Villages inhabited by the andriana (noble) class established by Andriamanelo typically contained a rova or palace compound.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Postclassic, {{the greater}} Q'umarkaj area is {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals. The nobles were known as the ajaw, while the vassals were known as the al k'ajol. The nobility were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords <b>who</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles {{as a result of their}} battlefield prowess. The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility. In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's central highlands, {{including}} {{the area around}} Ambohimanga, were first inhabited between 200 BCE–300 CE by the island's earliest settlers, the Vazimba, <b>who</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have arrived by pirogue from southeastern Borneo to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests. By the 15th century the Merina ethnic group from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings. The tombs of at least four Vazimba are located on or around Ambohimanga hill and are sites of pilgrimage, {{including the}} tombs of Ingorikelisahiloza, Andriantsidonina, Ramomba and Kotosarotra. In the mid-16th century the disparate Merina principalities were united as the Kingdom of Imerina {{under the rule of}} King Andriamanelo (1540–1575), who initiated military campaigns to expel or assimilate the Vazimba population. Conflict with the Vazimba led Andriamanelo to fortify his hill town using earthen walls, stone gateways and deep defensive trenches. This fortified town model, called a rova, was propagated by the noble class throughout Imerina until French colonization of Madagascar in 1895.|$|E

Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth.

25|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, archaeological {{excavations}} {{conducted by the}} Italian Archaeological School and by the American Classical School on the Athenian Acropolis and on other sites within Attica revealed Neolithic dwellings, tools, pottery and skeletons from domesticated animals (i.e.,sheep, fish). All of these discoveries showed significant resemblances to the Neolithic discoveries made on the Thessalian acropolises of Sesklo and Dimini. These discoveries help provide physical confirmation of the literary tradition that describes the Athenians as {{the descendants of the}} Pelasgians, <b>who</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> descend continuously from the Neolithic inhabitants in Thessaly.
