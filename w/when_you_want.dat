25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get a certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess {{that was one of the}} ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

"Drive" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Will Made It, Cyrus, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, and Samuel Jean; it was {{produced}} by Mike Will Made It, with co-production by P-Nasty, and engineered by Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan. Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Ryan Kaul. Cyrus commented that the song was written on Valentine's Day in 2013, which was [...] "emotionally [...] such a hard time"; she elaborated that the track was [...] "about needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship. It’s a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to leave but you can’t. It’s also about moving on." [...] It has been widely speculated to {{have been inspired by}} Cyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth.|$|E
500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to tell. When Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E

2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don't really believe it is kind of hard, particularly <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to call yourself an officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current."

And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away.

2500|$|Rather than {{destroying}} film studios, videotape sales {{became increasingly}} {{important to their}} revenue. The press discussed the VCR [...] "and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out {{for a couple of}} bucks the movie you want to see <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to see it". Film studios opened new divisions to produce prerecorded tapes, and by 1985 their sales were about the same as box office revenue; the Associated Press reported that [...] "because of the VCR, even a bad movie can make money". Although the VCR received blame for a 25% decline in the summer 1985 box office compared to 1984's, and closing movie theaters, by 1987 it was credited with causing a record-high box office, as videotapes' popularity encouraged consumers' interest in films and watching them in theaters. Cable movie channels worried about VCRs affecting subscriptions, but began to offer more films for owners who wanted to build a home library, even encouraging time shifting by broadcasting the movies during the night so VCRs could record them while their owners slept.|$|E
2500|$|Paisley {{was born}} on October 28, 1972, in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He is {{the only child of}} Douglas Edward [...] "Doug" [...] Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean [...] "Sandy" [...] (née Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher. He was raised in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He has stated that his love of country music stems from his {{maternal}} grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone, and taught him how to play at eight years old. At ten, he performed {{for the first time in}} public by singing in his church. He later recalled that, [...] "Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat thing about a small town is that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one." [...] At age 13, he wrote his first song, [...] "Born on Christmas Day", which later appeared on his album Brad Paisley Christmas. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence [...] "Hank" [...] Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called [...] "Brad Paisley and the C-Notes", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends.|$|E
2500|$|Kirchner {{was then}} {{admitted}} to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where {{he continued to}} produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to [...] "In den Lärchen" [...] in Frauenkirch Davos where he rented a room {{on the first floor}} and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: [...] "I’m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt’s studio". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes [...] "A Painter's Credo" [...] where he states: [...] "There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man…. This is the last judgement, before them you stand….. They help you when you work. You can thank them only through work. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to die, they sometimes appear to you. When you are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them". Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner's business there.|$|E
