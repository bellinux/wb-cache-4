25|$|At 5:30pm on 30 May 1940 a {{telephone}} request {{was made by}} the naval officer in charge at Margate that the Lord Southborough be launched and go across the channel to Dunkirk to help in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army. The lifeboat with her coxswain Edward Parker and her crew aboard headed off to Dunkirk, along with 18 other lifeboats which had been commandeered to help. The Margate crew were one of only three RNLI lifeboat crews used in the evacuation that were allowed to take their own lifeboat across. Many of the others were crewed by Navy ratings. Lord Southborough was second to arrive at the Dunkirk beaches, with the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential (ON 697) arriving a little before. The two lifeboats spent their first hours on the beaches ferrying soldiers from the shore to larger ships in deeper water off shore. The Lord Southborough has been credited with having brought off 600 military personnel from the beaches of Dunkirk, but the true figure is thought to be far greater than this. 500 of these were conveyed from the beach at La Panne to the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Icarus. The Commanding Officer of the destroyer, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Roper, said of the Lord Southborough’s crew On behalf of every officer and man on this ship, I should like to express to you our unbound admiration for the magnificent behaviour of the crew of the lifeboat Lord Southborough…. The manner in which, with no thought of rest, they brought off load after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire will be an inspiration to us all as long as we live. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>proud</b> to be the fellow countrymen of such men. The Lord Southborough’s Coxswain Edward Parker was one of the two lifeboat coxswains who were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their services at Dunkirk the other being Harold Knight coxswain of the Ramsgate Lifeboat.|$|E
