5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front <b>wheel,</b> <b>fork,</b> and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
50|$|The H.IX was {{of mixed}} construction, {{with the center}} pod made from welded steel tubing and wing spars built from wood. The wings were made from two thin, carbon-impregnated plywood panels glued {{together}} with a charcoal and sawdust mixture. The wing had a single main spar, penetrated by the jet engine inlets, and a secondary spar used for attaching the elevons. It was designed with a 7g load factor and a 1.8× safety rating; therefore, the aircraft had a 12.6g ultimate load rating. The wing's chord/thickness ratio ranged from 15% at the root to 8% at the wingtips. The aircraft utilized retractable tricycle landing gear, with the nosegear {{on the first two}} prototypes sourced from a He 177's tailwheel system, with the third prototype using an He 177A main gear wheelrim and tire on its custom-designed nosegear strutwork and <b>wheel</b> <b>fork.</b> A drogue parachute slowed the aircraft upon landing. The pilot sat on a primitive ejection seat. A special pressure suit was developed by Dräger. The aircraft was originally designed for the BMW 003 jet engine, but that engine was not quite ready, and the Junkers Jumo 004 engine was substituted.|$|E

40|$|Surmounting {{obstacles}} {{in the path}} of a robot vehicle is accomplished by rotating the <b>wheel</b> <b>forks</b> of the vehicle about their transverse axes with respect to the vehicle body so as to shift most of the vehicle weight onto the rear wheels, and then driving the vehicle forward so as to drive the now lightly-loaded front wheels (only) over the obstacle. Then, after the front wheels have either surmounted or completely passed the obstacle (depending upon the length of the obstacle), the forks are again rotated about their transverse axes so as to shift most of the vehicle weight onto the front wheels. Then the vehicle is again driven forward so as to drive the now lightly-loaded rear wheels over the obstacle. Once the obstacle has been completely cleared and the vehicle is again on relatively level terrain, the forks are again rotated so as to uniformly distribute the vehicle weight between the front and rear wheels...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of drag reduction in elite cycling has been recognised by cyclists and engineers for many years. Aerodynamics has such an influential role {{that it is}} often the difference between winning and losing. In pursuit of minimising drag, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an extremely powerful tool for investigating cycling aerodynamics. In the Sports Engineering Research Group at The University of Sheffield CFD is often used for this purpose. To develop confidence in the CFD results {{it is necessary to}} carry out validations; one such validation is presented in this paper. The flow around a front <b>wheel</b> and <b>fork</b> were analysed both in a wind tunnel and using CFD. The k-w turbulence model was found to give a slight over-prediction of drag <b>wheel</b> and <b>fork.</b> In comparison, all the other turbulence models consistently under-predicted drag by significant margin. From these results it appears the k-w model is the most suited to cycling aerodynamics. However, it is necessary to continue computational and experimental comparisons before firm conclusions can be drawn about the optimum CFD model for cycling...|$|R
5000|$|In {{situations}} where a crosswind is present, the aircraft will drift laterally as it approaches the runway. This drift poses significant safety issues because safe {{operation of the}} undercarriage requires the body and track of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway at touch down. The landing gear designs of the [...] "pioneer era" [...] 1909 Bleriot XI, and the much later Cold War B-52 strategic jet heavy bomber, were designed and each built with an unusual feature to counteract the problem: with the B-52, all four of its landing gear bogies could be steered, allowing the aircraft to land with the wheels facing the direction of travel even if the nose was not pointed in the same direction. The Bleriot XI had pivoting main gear legs, which passively allowed the main gear wheels to castor together about each of their vertical axes as a unit to allow small-angle crosswind landings, with bungee-cord loaded rigging members between the lower ends of the main <b>wheel</b> <b>forks,</b> to bring the wheels back to a [...] "directly-ahead" [...] orientation after touchdown.|$|R

50|$|Though the MN-A and the Maillet 20 {{had much}} in common, one obvious {{difference}} {{was in the}} landing gear. Both designs had mainwheels on vertical legs from the outer part of the wing inner section but the earlier model also had diagonal V-struts from axles to lower fuselage, whereas those of the Maillet 20 were cantilevers, without struttage. The legs had Messier oleo shock absorbers and mounted the <b>wheels</b> in <b>forks.</b> Both legs and wheels were enclosed in fairings.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, the FXS Low Rider was introduced.

[...] Unlike the Super Glide, the Low Rider was an instant hit; outselling all other Harley-Davidson models in its first full year of production. All three FX models returned to using Fat Bob tanks, but with a special center divider that included a tachometer.|$|R
5000|$|Intellectually, {{upcycling}} bears some {{resemblance to}} the ready-made art of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. Duchamp's [...] "Bicycle Wheel" [...] (1913), a front <b>wheel</b> and <b>fork</b> attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while [...] "Fountain" [...] (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work. Pablo Picasso's [...] "Bull's Head" [...] (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadists.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, while testing bicycle {{aerodynamics}} at the Texas A&M Wind Tunnel, Dan Empfield {{was introduced to}} the concept of interference drag between the bicycle fork and the front wheel. The first idea to overcome this was to make a front wheel with a narrow hub, 60mm instead of 80mm. This increased the amount of space air had to flow between the <b>wheel</b> and the <b>fork.</b> However, by 1996, Quintana Roo had developed a fork with [...] "wide" [...] blades, further increasing the space between the <b>wheel</b> and the <b>fork.</b> This was the QR Illuminaero fork, made out of aluminum. The next year Quintana Roo introduced the QR Carbonaero fork, which was made out of carbon fiber and much lighter than the QR Illuminaero fork.|$|R
5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front <b>wheel</b> <b>forks.</b> A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal drum clutch was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|R
25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} watch movements. Several manufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement <b>wheels</b> and <b>forks.</b> Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for watch movements are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|R
50|$|A {{quick release}} skewer is a {{mechanism}} for attaching a wheel to a bicycle. It consists of a rod threaded on one end and with a lever operated cam assembly on the other. The rod is inserted into the hollow axle of the wheel, a special nut is threaded on, and the lever is closed to tighten the cam and secure the <b>wheel</b> to the <b>fork.</b> <b>Wheels</b> equipped with quick release mechanisms can {{be removed from the}} bicycle frame and replaced without using tools by opening and closing the cam lever, thus more quickly than wheels with solid axles and nuts. On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop the chassis of an electric motorcycle that takes part in the international competition Smart Moto Challenge 2016, showing the work {{that has been done}} inside the e-Ride ETSEIB team. It focuses on the design of the frame and the swing arm, their FEM simulation and the manufacturing process to obtain them. Design is done taking in account the different requirements that must accomplish the motorcycle, such as the components that must hold the structure or the desired geometry of the chassis. Final design not only includes the frame and the swing arm, but also all the commercial parts that form the chassis assembly: <b>wheels,</b> <b>fork,</b> suspension, brakes, bearings, handlebar, footrests [...] . The FEM study includes stiffness simulations of the frame and the swing arm in order to prove the dynamic properties of the motorcycle. It also has been considered several resistance simulations of the parts of the chassis that receive the higher loads to guarantee that they will resist any unforeseen critical stresses during the life of the motorcycle. All the simulations and the consequent optimization process have been done with the aim of keeping the weight of the tested parts as low as possible. The manufacturing process of both frame and swing arm is explained with detail and has been proved by the manufacturing sponsor that is going to build these parts...|$|R
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} riders I ever saw, winning races from a quarter-mile to six hours. Usually when thinking of motor-paced riders, we regard them as specialists who, once they have adopted the little front <b>wheel,</b> reversed <b>forks</b> and big gears are somehow never able to show good form in normal competition. Meredith was an exception. He mixed his racing most successfully and, in 1910, when he had already been world champion five times, astounded the cycling world by becoming the first rider ever to beat five hours for an unpaced out-and-home 100 miles on the road.|$|R
500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to the front wheel, as the rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on the front <b>wheel,</b> the front <b>forks</b> compress under load, changing the bike geometry. This all puts extra load on the front wheel.|$|R
50|$|Updates in 2000 saw {{the wheels}} change and get updated to all new Marchesini <b>wheels.</b> The front <b>forks</b> were also {{titanium}} nitrided to reduce stiction.

50|$|Bicycles, {{tricycles}} and quadracycles share (with minor variations) several {{basic parts}} including <b>wheels,</b> pedals, cranks, <b>forks,</b> and the saddle with unicycles.Without a rider unicycles lack stability - however, a proficient unicyclist is usually {{more stable than}} a similarly proficient rider on a bicycle as the wheel is not constrained by the linear axis of a frame.Unicycles usually lack brakes, gears, {{and the ability to}} freewheel.|$|R
50|$|The dog or {{dogs are}} fitted with {{harnesses}} suitable for pulling and running in, such as x-back harnesses. The harnesses are normally {{attached to a}} gang line (if more than one dog is being used), and a bungee towline, which clips {{to the front of}} the bicycle. Many bikejorers use bayonets, antennas, or plastic pipes to suspend the towline above the front wheel, and to prevent it from tangling between the <b>wheel</b> and <b>forks.</b> If two dogs are employed on a gang line, they are sometimes also attached to each other by a neckline between their collars. Bikejoring can be fun but has its dangers. The dogs may be distracted by wild-life.|$|R
5000|$|One {{very early}} {{undercarriage}} arrangement that passively allowed for castoring during crosswind landings, unlike the [...] "active" [...] arrangement on the B-52, was pioneered on the Bleriot VIII design of 1908. It was later {{used in the}} much more famous Blériot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the Etrich Taube. In this arrangement the main landing gear's shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main <b>wheel's</b> suspension <b>fork,</b> allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.|$|R
50|$|There was {{an export}} bike {{primarily}} {{for use as}} a desert racer, sold up until 1969 as the Norton P11, AJS Model 33, Matchless G15 and Norton N15 which used the Norton Atlas engine in a modified Matchless G85CS scrambler frame with Norton <b>wheels</b> and front <b>forks.</b> This bike was reputed to vibrate less than the Featherbed frame model. AMC singles were also sold with Norton badging in this era.|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front <b>wheel,</b> the <b>fork,</b> and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|R
