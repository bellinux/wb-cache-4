Five years later it {{was reported in the}} German newspaper Der Spiegel that in the 1950s he had been recruited by the Stasi, the East German secret police, to monitor the arrival of American nuclear weapons into West Germany. In 2008 he had debts exceeding €700,000, and <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> social security; his situation had not changed by 2013, and he remained bitter about his treatment.|$|E
5|$|There is no firm {{documentary}} evidence of {{occupation of the}} Webster County village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were living on the Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (or Point de Sable, Point au Sable, Point Sable, Pointe DuSable) (before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is {{regarded}} as the first permanent resident of what became Chicago, Illinois. Little is known of his life prior to the 1770s. In 1779, he <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the site of present-day Michigan City, Indiana, when he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of being an American sympathizer in the American Revolutionary War. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now the city of St. Clair, Michigan, before moving to settle {{at the mouth of the}} Chicago River. He is first recorded living in Chicago in early 1790, having apparently become established sometime earlier. He sold his property in Chicago in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he died in 1818.|$|E

5|$|Mengele's {{name was}} {{mentioned}} {{several times during}} the Nuremberg trials, but Allied forces were convinced that he was dead. Irene and the family in Günzburg also said that he was dead. Working in West Germany, Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein collected information from witnesses as to Mengele's wartime activities. In a search of the public records, Langbein found Mengele's divorce papers listing an address in Buenos Aires. He and Wiesenthal pressured West German authorities into drawing up an arrest warrant on 5 June 1959, and starting extradition proceedings. Initially Argentina turned down the request, because the fugitive was no longer living at the address given on the documents. By the time extradition was approved on 30 June 1960, Mengele had already fled to Paraguay, where he <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> a farm near the Argentine border.|$|E
5|$|Moses Hazen {{had served}} as a {{lieutenant}} in the 44th Regiment during the French and Indian War and was receiving a half-pay pension for his British service. In 1775, while he <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> this plus the income from his estate in St. Jean, Quebec, the colonial army invaded. Nevertheless, Hazen was arrested by the British on suspicion of spying for the Americans. He was held a prisoner for 54 days, until he was finally released by General Montgomery after the fall of Montreal in November. Hazen then joined the American cause, and took part in the battle of Quebec. Following the American failure to take the city, Hazen and Edward Antill, an American expatriate, traveled to Philadelphia to report on the battle. Congress partially compensated Hazen by establishing the 2nd Canadian Regiment. He accepted the command, thus forfeiting his British half-pay. Antill was made lieutenant colonel of the regiment. Although John Duggan, one of Livingston's captains, had been promised a regiment by Benedict Arnold, Hazen and Antill reached Philadelphia before Duggan, and Hazen smeared his name in his effort to get command of the regiment.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of Gil-galad is {{somewhat}} obscure, as Tolkien himself repeatedly {{changed his mind about}} who exactly Gil-galad was, and how to fit him into the already existing history of the First Age (see concept and creation, below). Gil-galad was certainly born in Beleriand {{at some point during the}} First Age. He was perhaps at some point sent to live in the Falas with Círdan the Shipwright, but this is unclear; certainly after the fall of Nargothrond he <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> the Isle of Balar with Círdan, and became the last High King of the Noldor following the fall of Gondolin and the death of Turgon. Gil-galad, despite his long life (he was born during the First Age and lived through almost the entirety of the Second), was not known to have a wife, nor any children. Due to this, and the fact that there were few Noldor remaining in Middle-earth, the title of High King of the Noldor in Exile ended with his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1881 at age 13 he {{was living}} {{with his family and}} five {{servants}} at 4 Atherton Terrace, Kensington.

He <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>on</b> his own means, as was his mother, although his brother Herbert was a stocks and shares dealer. On 21 February 1895 at Christ Church, Surbiton Hill, Kingston he married Anna Christina Ravenhill (1871–1965) second daughter of W.W. Ravenhill of the Inner Temple. They had seven children, of whom one died at the Vicarage, Bradley, on 26 November 1895. Three days later on 29 November, Jerram had his overcoat stolen from a chapel during a choral rehearsal. By 1911 they were living at the Vicarage, Langford, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, in the Langford Berkshire parish. They had four of their children living with them, alongside a governess and two domestic servants. On 22 September 1914 he lost his son, Midshipman Harry E.R. Jerram, RN, aged 17, when HMS Hogue was torpedoed.|$|E
