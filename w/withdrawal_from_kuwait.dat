25|$|A UN-brokered ceasefire became {{active in}} July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war. Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his {{image in the}} West by visiting other countries, and by {{appearing}} at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail. The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in {{what became known as}} the Gulf War. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's. After informing the then American president George H. W. Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved. On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution. Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicionthey distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth.|$|E

5000|$|Douglas {{also became}} the Executive Chairman of the Libyan-based World Mathaba, {{a group that}} trained and advised guerrilla {{resistance}} movements worldwide. In this capacity he persuaded Colonel Gaddafi to begin negotiations with the British for the trial of suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and supported anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC), which provided critical support to the toppling of apartheid and the freeing of Nelson Mandela. [...] In Douglas's view, there was nothing extremist about his activities, centred as they were on defeating despots and freeing Nelson Mandela, who was steadfastly supported by the Gaddafi regime. “All Dominicans supported the freedom of Mandela,” he says. “And the freedom of Mandela wasn't a cakewalk on a Sunday morning - it was a revolutionary struggle in which people fought, died, and killed.” Douglas, {{in his capacity as}} Executive Chairman of the World Mathaba, was also part of a negotiating team seeking an Iraqi <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> to avert the Gulf War. Speaking at the anti-sanctions forum in New York on 20 January 1996, Douglas stated: [...] "I visited Iraq in 1990. In fact, left Baghdad two days before the war really began, on probably the last flight out. They had first imposed sanctions in August 1990. So even at that time, children were already dying {{because of a lack of}} medicines. I visited hospitals and saw it. And that was six months into the sanctions and before the war actually began. So you can imagine how after five years, with a tightening of those sanctions, the children of Iraq are suffering. All children have a right to a decent life, all children have the right to benefit from the fruits and resources of their country. What is good for the children of America is also good for the children of Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Vietnam, China all over the world." ...|$|E
