25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> him, and that she would see him at home.|$|E

After they agreed to take a parenting class, charges were dropped several years later.|$|E
2500|$|Marr played guitar {{on several}} Pet Shop Boys songs; he {{continues}} to have guest appearances on their albums, with his most significant contribution on Release (2002). The only remix that Marr has ever done was for Pet Shop Boys—it was a mix of his favourite track from their 1987 album, Actually, called [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Wake</b> Up", and was released as the b-side to 1993's [...] "Can You Forgive Her?" [...] He later worked as a guest musician on the Oasis album Heathen Chemistry.

2500|$|Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton {{were mainly}} {{responsible}} for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand {{for all of these}} to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were [...] "at-odds": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> her up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more [...] "computery-sounding" [...] voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley [...] "sounded perfectly human" [...] due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered {{by the fact that the}} new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should [...] "go someplace" [...] and that since GLaDOS is [...] "kind of likeable in the first game" [...] and players [...] "enjoy being with her", they would utilize Wheatley as an [...] "other, external threat". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.|$|E
