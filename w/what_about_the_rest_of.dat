Two hundred eighty-six professionals responded to a questionnaire in a midwestern state. The sample included 219 women and 67 men. Participants were classified as health care professionals (N= 91), non-health care professionals (N= 137), or non-health care professionals with training in health or nutrition (N= 58). Respondents reported their height, and present, highest, and lowest adult weights. From these, body mass index (kg/m 2) was calculated, and subjects were classified by weight history. Thirty- three percent of the health professionals and 28 percent of the nonhealth care professionals who had ever been overweight successfully lost weight. The greatest degree of success was in smoking cessation. Only 26 (9 %) of the total indicated that they were currently smokers, and 24 percent of these who had once smoked were still smokers.

Such characterizations are necessary if we are to distinguish complex systems from other kinds of dynamical systems, influence their functioning, forecast their behavior and formulate the public policies to be followed in dealing with them. In fact, some people seem to be making considerable progress. These include the people who study systems which can be modeled as biotic systems, cellular automata or networks, or as systems which can be adapted to the framework of statistical physics.

40|$|Abstract. After the {{emergence}} of Allen s Interval Algebra Qualitative Spatial Reasoning {{has evolved into a}} fruitful field of research in artificial intelligence with possible applications in geographic information systems (GIS) and robot navigation Qualitative Spatial Reasoning abstracts from the detailed metric description of space using rich mathematical theories and restricts its language to a finite, often rather small, set of relations that fulfill certain properties. This approach is often deemed to be cognitively adequate. A major question in qualitative spatial reasoning is whether a description of a spatial situation given as a constraint network is consistent. The problem becomes a hard one since the domain of space (often R 2) is infinite. In contrast many of the interesting problems for constraint satisfaction have a finite domain on which backtracking methods can be used. But because of the infinity of its domains these methods are generally not applicable to Qualitative Spatial Reasoning. Anyhow the method of path consistency or rather its generalization algebraic closure turned out to be helpful to a certain degree for many qualitative spatial calculi. The problem regarding this method is that it depends on the existence of a composition table, and calculating this table is not an easy task. For example the dipole calculus (operating on oriented dipoles) DRAf has 72 base relations and binary composition, hence its composition table has 5184 entries. Finding all these entries by hand is a hard, long and error-prone task. Finding them using a computer is also not easy, since the semantics of DRAf in the Euclidean Plane, its natural domain, rely on non-linear inequalities. This is not a special problem of the DRAf calculus. In fact, all calculi dealing with relative orientation share the property of having semantics based on non-linear inequalities in the Euclidean plane. This not only makes it hard to find a composition table, it also makes it particularly hard to decide consistency for these calculi. As shown in [79] algebraic closure is always just an approximation to consistency for these calculi, but it is the only method that works fast. Methods like Gröbner reasoning can decide consistency for these calculi but only for small constraint networks. Still finding a composition table for DRAf is a fruitful task, since we can use it analyze the properties of composition based reasoning for such a calculus and it is a starting point for the investigation {{of the quality of the}} approximation of consistency for this calculus. We utilize a new approach for calculating the composition table for DRAf using condensed semantics, i. e. the domain of the calculus is compressed in such a way that only finitely many possible configurations need to be investigated. In fact, only the configurations need to be investigated that turn out to represent special characteristics for the placement of three lines in the plane. This method turns out to be highly efficient for calculating the composition table of the calculus. Another method of obtaining a composition table is borrowing it via a suitable morphism. Hence, we investigate morphisms between qualitative spatial calculi. Having the composition table is not the end but rather the beginning of the problem. With that table we can compute algebraically closed refinements of constraint networks, but how meaningful is this process? We know that all constraint networks for which such a refinement does not exist are inconsistent, but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest?</b> In fact, they may be consistent or not. If they are all consistent, then we can be happy, since algebraic closure would decide consistency for the calculus at hand. We investigate LR, DRAf and DRAfp and show that for all these calculi algebraic closure does not decide consistency. In fact, for the LR calculus algebraic closure is an extremely bad approximation of consistency. For this calculus we introduce a new method for the approximation of consistency based on triangles, that performs far better than algebraic closure. A major weak spot of the field of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning is the area of applications. It is hard to refute the accusation of qualitative spatial calculi having only few applications so far. As a step into the direction of scrutinizing the applicability of these calculi, we examine the performance of DRA and OPRA in the issue of describing and navigating street networks based on local observations. Especially for OPRA we investigate a factorization of the base relations that is deemed cognitively adequate. Whenever possible we use real-world data in these investigations obtained from OpenStreetMap...|$|R

40|$|In 2011 we {{pointed out}} that the study of palaeotsunamis in the Pacific was in its infancy. This is still the case, but it is hardly {{surprising}} given that there are 1, 000 kms of circum-Pacific coastline that are largely unstudied and even several countries where palaeotsunami research is yet to be carried out. Within the Pacific Basin there are some 20, 000 Pacific Islands, all of which have the potential to add {{to our understanding of the}} magnitude, frequency and source of past tsunamis. This is a huge jigsaw puzzle and in reality we have only got a few of the pieces, but even so a combination of Pacific Island and circum-Pacific country data is starting to provide clues about past events. We discuss some of our findings from the SW Pacific region with respect to palaeotsunamis generated by subduction zone events and look at not only the geological evidence, but also a wider multi-proxy toolkit that includes both archaeology and anthropology. In other words, we may argue about the dating or geological validity of a specific event on a specific island, but the bigger story being told of widespread, contemporaneous societal change provides an additional line of evidence that we ignore at our peril. This is all well and good, but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific? Where to from here? It has long been recognised that the Hawaiian Islands are exposed to tsunamis from almost every large subduction zone in the Pacific - Alaska (1946), Kamchatka (1952), Chile (1960) and Japan (2011) to name but a few. Furthermore, it has also been shown that the geological evidence for such events can be found in the islands. Recently, some researchers have suggested that the well-known Makauwahi Cave deposit on Kauai is the “missing link” of evidence for a giant Aleutian subduction zone event in the 16 th/ 17 th century. In the absence of more physical evidence this may be drawing something of a long bow, BUT the key take home message here is that different events from different sources affect different coasts of different Hawaiian Islands differently. Historical events alone indicate that the islands can act like a giant tsunami “rose diagram“, so why are we not looking harder at these islands and others within the Pacific to vastly improve our understanding of palaeotsunamis in the Pacific?

40|$|Last winter, when {{hundreds}} of letters written by Willa Cather were donated to the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, the world got its first glimpse of a significant unread text {{of one of the}} United States 2 ̆ 7 most accomplished authors. These letters, written over four decades to Cather 2 ̆ 7 s brother Roscoe and his family, are remarkable artifacts: meditations on the writing process, anxious descriptions of new ideas, celebrations of professional success, solicitations for financial advice, and gripes about family squabbles. They reveal details of complex and intense familial relationships that Cather 2 ̆ 7 s biographers have not understood before, and they provide new details about the development and writing of Cather 2 ̆ 7 s novels. For all of the new information found in the letters of the Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection, the arrival of this correspondence raises an important question. For decades, Cather 2 ̆ 7 s critics and biographers have casually referred to her decision, late in life, to destroy all of her letters. The story is typically told somewhat like this: In her last, misanthropic years, Willa Cather, helped by her companion Edith Lewis, systematically collected and destroyed all the letters she could find in order to prevent undignified exposure to the rotting world. Then, to make doubly sure that nothing untoward slipped before the public eye, Cather put a provision in her will to ban all publication of or direct quotation from her surviving correspondence. After Cather died, Edith Lewis, the executor of Cather 2 ̆ 7 s estate, continued the efforts and destroyed whatever other letters she could find or buy. This basic story has been repeated many times, but is it true? We know with certainty that Cather banned publication of her letters in her will-there are legal documents to prove it. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the narrative? Did she seek to reclaim her letters in order to destroy them? If she did, why are so many still around? If she did not, why is that story so often repeated? Where does it come from? The arrival of the Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection provides physical evidence that, at the least, if Willa Cather and Edith Lewis did try to collect and burn up all the letters, they were very bad at it. Thousands of letters have survived and are available to be read not only in this collection but in repositories around the United States. There are currently around 2, 500 pieces of correspondence written by Willa Cather, held in about seventy-five different repositories. The largest stores of letters are at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln, Harvard University, the Willa Cather Foundation in Red Cloud, Nebraska, and the University of Virginia. Like the new Roscoe and Meta Cather Collection, many of these large collections of letters came to institutions from the hands or families of people to whom Cather remained close until the end of her life, and many of these same people had affectionate relationships with Edith Lewis after Cather 2 ̆ 7 s death. If Cather 2 ̆ 7 s family and life-long friends would not cooperate in the supposed campaign to destroy the correspondence, who would...|$|E

They’re always telling me how much worse it could be + that we should be thankful you’re not overseas + they know people who - They just go on like that all the time. It’s a darn good thing I’ve got a sense of humor. This is really a riot when you think about it. It’s not especially funny now but it will be when we’re old + tell our children about it. Honey, let’s think of some nice unusual names for our kids- (not Leslie). But we’ve got the first boy all settled, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest?</b> I love nicknames- we’ll have to be careful though that the nicknames from their names are nice ones. I’m waiting for the sun to get a half hour’s warmer before I go out- there’s a terrific breeze now + it’s like the middle of winter. Gee, darling, I love you so much. Every night when all the instructors start coming home I get so much more lonesome. They all go home to their little wives + are very lucky. Sure wish that you were coming home every night darling. Gee, honey, I really miss you an awful lot. Thought it was bad when you were down at Spence but this is much worse. But I guess we are lucky at that. Seventeen days isn’t such a long time- it say here. But if I see you this weekend it won’t be so much longer before you’re back here again. Honey, golly, I love you. Wend out to the Post again today. Wish you were here. (sounds like a postcard.) What weather- Golly, everyone’s just about freezing around here. It was a nice day though. Sorta windy but there were loads of AT- 6 ’s up. It’s so quiet when they don’t fly. Golly, darling, tomorrow will be Thursday. You left for Eglin a week ago today. It seems so much longer than that, though. What a week it’s been. Got the letter you wrote Monday night, honey. Glad you’re practicing your French like a good little boy. Well, it’s nothing definite but I sure hope you’re going to be a French Instructor. Yes, honey, that’s all you need. That would mean that we’d be together that much longer. That means a lot to me. I think you’d bear up under the strain. If they try to make you one, the only thing you could do would be to be a good one! That’s easy! Well, darling, guess changes for your getting off Saturday aren’t very good. Oh, well, it would have been wonderful and it made the week go faster- just thinking about it. Gee, honey, it’s almost an emergency. Golly, we’ve been married for so long- so long being ten days- and have only been together less than two and a half days. Oh, well, if it were normal then it just wouldn’t be us. Maybe someday we’ll lead a nice normal peaceful life but I doubt it + hope not. That would probably be very dull. Besides, I’m very lonesome and in love. The being in love part is just fine but darn the old Army anyhow. They can’t do this to us. Don’t they realize we’re really just married. We, all the wives around here, have come to the conclusion that the Army doesn’t like wives and does about everything they can to make it tough for them. Honey, do you think we’ll get a leave after this? It doesn’t make much difference to me one way or the other- just as long as we can be together. Thought you were getting back on the 31 st, honey. It seems so darned far away. You said you might be back Sunday at noon. Golly, darling, I’ll be waiting for that call tomorrow night. Alice, an Officer’s wife down the street is going to let me use her hot water to wash my hair with. Can’t do it here with that fool hot water boiler. Her husband’s been in five years now. He’s due for his Captaincy any day. They’re both nice kids + have been married nine months. They have a black and tan cocker named rebel. She’s so cute. Wish Rex was here. Everyone has a dog. Almost all cockers too. Boy, if you have a dog or a baby, though, you might as well give up. No one will rent to you. Why in the name of heaven don’t they let you fly when it’s nice. That’s burning me up. Why do they waste all that time. They’d think we’d been married for a long time the way they keep us apart. Was hunting fun? I’d love to go sometime. Golly, I never could hit the broad side of a barn. Maybe you could teach me. Well, well, so you’ve got a nice even tan all over, huh. Think maybe I’ll find me a place like Eglin- without the men + go for a [?] + get me a nice even tan. I tried again today but just when the sun got warm enough, it got really cloudy + the wind was so strong I had to come in. So now I’m as pale as ever. Wanted to get a nice tan before I went to Pensacola- I sure hope I’ll be going now. It’s awful not knowing but it’s almost better not to know because then I can hope. Oh, is that how you found out my phone. I thought the hotel had told you. They know where I was. Oh, no- the night people didn’t. The U. S. O. is a big help sometimes. Young man has anyone ever told you that you have very wolfish tendencies? And that now that you are a married man you must learn to control them. In fact you should abolish them altogether. Well, the room has a double bed. (Tried so hard to find twin beds- ahem!) + that’s the most important thing. There’s a closet on one side of the bed- (right) and a table with a lamp on the other. There’s a closed fireplace + a gas heater in front of it. There are two windows + two mirrors + two chairs. Very complete description. And there’s luggage all over the place. Yes, I like it. Mrs. Moseley is very nice to me. Wonder when you’ll start getting my letters. Have written about every day except last Sunday. You’ve been real good, honey. It’s been wonderful hearing from you every day. Are you kidding- if I think the trip will be too much for me- I’d walk all the way if necessary. A little trip certainly won’t be too much for me. In fact I’ll enjoy it. I’ve always wanted to go to Florida. Golly, I hope you can get that pass, honey. Gee, Judd, we’re really married. Remember we used to write how wonderful it would be when we were together always after we were married. We certainly started off differently. Well, darling, you must know how very much I miss you. Seems I’ve told you often enough now. But every day I miss you more + love you so. Golly, it will be wonderful to be with you again. Sure hope that it’s this weekend, honey. You’re so crazy, darling, and I love you so much. Well, you’d better practice up on your French, honey, just in case. Hope that you get some letters soon darling. They’re going to come in a big bunch, I guess. They’ve sorta decreased in length because I’ve been out most of the day. Well, honey, I have a lot to do before I get to bed. Wish that you were here to get in the way. Golly, Judd, I love you so. If we ever have a few minutes together, I’m sure we’ll be the happiest married people ever. Golly, darling, I miss you so much- Well, honey, I’ve got my fingers crossed, honey, about this weekend. I love you so and miss you terribly. Oh, if I come down I’ll bring Tom’s glasses down. Julie + Betty Jo are worked about them. Wonder how much money I should get out of the bank. Oh, well, I’ll decide that tomorrow. I love you so, honey. You’ll have all my love always + I’ll always be- Yours- Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
