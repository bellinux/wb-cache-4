25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes.

She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted {{with her left hand}} instead. To overcome <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images.
