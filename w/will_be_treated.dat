5|$|In {{answering}} {{both questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

40|$|Violent {{abduction}} {{of a woman}} {{against her}} <b>will</b> <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> with some sympathy in the twelfth-century novel, especially in Theodore Prodromos, {{in sharp contrast to}} the romanticism of the ancient novel; this departure is illuminated by the contemporary conflict between the harsh secular and the more indulgent canon law on abduction. </span...|$|R
25|$|On Sunday 22 July the Queensland {{government}} {{revealed that}} Haneef <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> “as a terrorist” while detained {{in jail and}} subject to special conditions, including solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.|$|E
25|$|The Internal Revenue Service {{ruled that}} investors' capital losses {{in this and}} other {{fraudulent}} investment schemes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as business losses, thereby allowing the victims to claim them as net operating losses to reduce tax liability more easily.|$|E
25|$|The nominative, ergative and dative are core cases, {{and due to}} {{the complex}} morphosyntactic {{alignment}} of Georgian, each one has several different functions and also overlap with each other, in different contexts. They <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> together with the verb system.|$|E

25|$|In {{an episode}} of Fantasy Island, Dr. Anne Frankenstein, a {{descendant}} of Dr. Frankenstein, visits the island {{to try to find}} out about her ancestor.

[...] "Really, mamma, I don't think it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treating</b> Fanny well {{to be asking}} all these people so soon. The O'Joscelyns, or the Fitzgeralds, are all very well--just our own near neighbours; but don't you think, mamma, it's rather too soon to be asking a house-full of strange people?" ...|$|R
25|$|On 3 November 2015 the Allahabad High Court {{observed}} {{that a child}} born out of rape will have inheritance rights over {{the property of the}} assaulter and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as illegitimate, however if the child is taken for adoption then he/she will not have any rights on the property of the biological father.|$|E
25|$|Glass items {{which have}} been {{contaminated}} with a biohazardous material <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> with the same concern as needles and blades, even if unbroken. If glass is uncontaminated, it is still often treated as a sharp, because it can break during the disposal process. Contaminated plastic items which are not sharp can be disposed of in a biohazardous waste receptacle instead of a sharps container.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{water slide}} uses a pump system to pump {{water to the}} top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces {{friction}} so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed {{at the top and}} the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> immediately.|$|E
50|$|Another {{somewhat}} improved {{feature is}} the fact that various costumes of the same character <b>will</b> no longer <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as separate characters; instead, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> now <b>treated</b> as alternate costumes and can be chosen prior to a fight. There are, however, some outfits that still have to be assigned to a separate slot in the select screen, due to having an exclusive Big Bang Attack.|$|R

25|$|The {{natural gas}} {{fed into the}} LNG plant <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> to remove water, {{hydrogen}} sulfide, {{carbon dioxide and other}} components that will freeze (e.g., benzene) under the low temperatures needed for storage or be destructive to the liquefaction facility. LNG typically contains more than 90 percentmethane. It also contains small amounts of ethane, propane, butane, some heavier alkanes, and nitrogen. The purification process can be designed to give almost 100 percentmethane. One of the risks of LNG is a rapid phase transition explosion (RPT), which occurs when cold LNG comes into contact with water.|$|E
25|$|The Department of the Taoiseach {{has issued}} {{guidelines}} to assist persons in giving {{due respect to}} the national flag. Observance of the guidelines {{is a matter for}} each individual as there are no statutory requirements. It is expected, however, that the national flag <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> at all times with appropriate respect by those who use it. The Department has general responsibility in relation to the national flag and this is primarily concerned with the protocol for the flying of the flag. The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E
25|$|Geographical names may {{be treated}} as {{singular}} {{even if they are}} plural in form, if they are regarded as representing a single entity such as a country: The United States is a country in North America (similarly with the Netherlands, the Philippines, Trinidad and Tobago, etc. The United Nations is also treated as singular.). However, if the sense is a group of geographical objects, such as islands or mountains, a plural-form name <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as plural: The Hebrides are a group of islands off the coast of Scotland.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to say {{with a high degree of}} confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright. It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.|$|E
25|$|Following the Korean Air 801 crash, it {{was brought}} to the NTSB's {{attention}} that foreign carriers flying {{in and out of the}} US were not covered by the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 and Korean Air did not have a plan to deal with the situation they encountered. As a result, US Congress passed the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997 to require those carriers to file family assistance plans and fulfill the same family support requirements as domestic airlines. Not only does the Act ensure that all victims and family members <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> equitably, regardless of the carrier they use, it also impels many carriers that may not have thought about family assistance issues to give them due consideration in their emergency response plans.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around the cages to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay {{in a short time}} period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments is that all the fish <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> equally, in contrast to in-feed treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons.|$|E
