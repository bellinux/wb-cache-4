The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) design speed, and they were considered the first fast battleships.|$|E

They voted plantation owners £20million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, British Honduras and Canada. Nearly 800,000 African slaves <b>were</b> <b>freed,</b> the vast majority in the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") <b>were</b> <b>freed,</b> and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav People's Army took {{thousands}} of prisoners {{during the war}} in Croatia, and interned them in camps in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.

Some infamous prisons included the Sremska Mitrovica camp, the Stajićevo camp, and the Begejci camp in Serbia, and the Morinj camp in Montenegro. The Croatian Army also established detention camps, such as the Lora prison camp in Split.|$|E

5|$|The {{party of}} Behar {{survivors}} {{who had been}} landed at Tanjung Priok were initially interred in prisoner of war camps in Java; the male prisoners were sent to a camp near Batavia and the women were held in a female camp nearby.
