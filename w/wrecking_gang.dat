6000|$|... "I can't tell. Perhaps {{only a few}} hours, perhaps more. It {{depends on}} how soon the <b>wrecking</b> <b>gang</b> arrive on the spot. As soon as they get there, they will go right to work, and it won't take them long to fix matters up." ...|$|E

When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has {{accompanied}} her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the <b>wrecking</b> <b>gang,</b> who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be caused, fences the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing {{a fraction of the}} takings back to Joss and the gang.|$|E

Frightened at first, Kathie comes to see that Johnny is genuinely attracted to her and means her no harm. When she opens {{up to him and}} asks to go with him, he rejects her. Crying, she runs away. Johnny drives off to search for her. Art sees and misinterprets this as an attack. The townspeople have had enough. Johnny's supposed assault on Kathie is the last straw. Vigilantes led by Charlie chase and catch Johnny and beat him mercilessly, but he escapes on his motorcycle when Harry confronts the mob. The mob give chase, but Johnny is hit by a thrown tire iron and falls. His riderless motorcycle strikes and kills Jimmy.|$|R
50|$|After {{the gang}} leaves, Pengallan {{releases}} {{himself from his}} bonds and reveals himself to Trehearne. He gives Patience a loaded pistol and instructs her to shoot Trehearne if he gets loose, then leaves. Trehearne reasons with Patience, promising to let her and Joss escape if she releases him. She agrees and unties him. He sets out for a nearby military camp to get backup. Meanwhile, Mary goes to the wrecking site and re-lights the warning beacon which the wreckers had extinguished. The crew of the ship see the light and avoid the rocks. The gang resolve to kill Mary for preventing the wreck. Joss, who has developed a reluctant admiration for her, rescues her and the two escape by horse-cart, but Joss is {{shot in the back}} and collapses when they reach Jamaica Inn. As Patience is about to tell Mary that Pengallan is the secret leader of the <b>wrecking</b> <b>gang,</b> Pengallan shoots and kills Patience from offstage. Joss then dies of his wound as well. While Mary is reeling from the shock of witnessing these two violent deaths, Pengallan takes her hostage, ties and gags her, and tells her that he plans to keep her now that she has {{no one else in the}} world. He drives her, still tied up and covered by a heavy cloak, to the harbor, where they board a ship bound for France.|$|E
