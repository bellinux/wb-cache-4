40|$|Environmentally harmful {{consequences}} of fossil fuel utilisation andthe landfilling of wastes {{have increased the}} interest among the energy producers to consider the use of alternative fuels like wood fuels and Refuse-Derived Fuels, RDFs. The fluidised bed technology that allows the flexible use {{of a variety of}} different fuels is commonly used at small- and medium-sized power plants ofmunicipalities and industry in Finland. Since there is only one mass-burn plantcurrently in operation in the country and no intention to build new ones, the co-firing of pre-processed wastes in fluidised bed boilers has become the most generally applied waste-to-energy concept in Finland. The recently validated EU Directive on Incineration of Wastes aims to mitigate environmentally harmful pollutants of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> <b>co-incineration</b> of wastes with conventional fuels. Apart from gaseous flue gas pollutants and dust, the emissions of toxic tracemetals are limited. The implementation of the Directive's restrictions in the Finnish legislation is assumed to limit the co-firing of waste fuels, due to the insufficient reduction of the regulated air pollutants in the existing flue gas cleaning devices. Trace metals emission formation and reduction in the ESP, the condensing wet scrubber, the fabric filter, and the humidification reactor were studied, experimentally, in full- and pilot-scale combustors utilising the bubbling fluidised bed technology, and, theoretically, by means of reactor model calculations. The core of the model is a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis. The experiments were carried out with wood chips, sawdust, and peat, and their refuse-derived fuel, RDF, blends. In all, ten different fuels or fuel blends were tested. Relatively high concentrations of trace metals in RDFs compared to the concentrations of these metals in wood fuels increased the trace metal concentrations in the flue gas after the boiler ten- to hundred-folds, when RDF was co-fired with sawdust in a full-scale BFB boiler. In the case of peat, lesser increase in trace metal concentrations was observed, due to the higher initial trace metal concentrations of peat compared to sawdust. Despite the high removal rate of most of the trace metals in the ESP, the Directive emission limits for trace metals were exceeded in each of the RDF co-firing tests. The dominat trace metals in fluegas after the ESP were Cu, Pb and Mn. In the condensing wet scrubber, the flue gas trace metal emissions were reduced below the Directive emission limits, whenRDF pellet was used as a co-firing fuel together with sawdust and peat. High chlorine content of the RDFs enhanced the mercuric chloride formation and hence the mercury removal in the ESP and scrubber. Mercury emissions were lower than theDirective emission limit for total Hg, 0. 05 mg/Nm 3, in all full-scale co-firingtests already in the flue gas after the ESP. The pilot-scale experiments with aBFB combustor equipped with a fabric filter revealed that the fabric filter alone is able to reduce the trace metal concentrations, including mercury, in the flue gas during the RDF co-firing approximately to the same level as they are during the wood chip firing. Lower trace metal emissions than the Directive limits were easily reached even with a 40 % thermal share of RDF co-firing with sawdust. Enrichment of trace metals in the submicron fly ash particle fraction because of RDF co-firing was not observed in the test runs where sawdust was used as the main fuel. The combustion of RDF pellets with peat caused an enrichment of As, Cd, Co, Pb, Sb, and V in the submicron particle mode. Accumulation and release oftrace metals in the bed material was examined by means of a bed material analysis, mass balance calculations and a reactor model. Lead, zinc and copper were found to have a tendency to be accumulated in the bed material but also to have a tendency to be released from the bed material into the combustion gases, if the combustion conditions were changed. The concentration of the trace metal in the combustion gases of the bubbling fluidised bed boiler was found to be a summary of trace metal fluxes from three main sources. They were (1) the trace metal flux from the burning fuel particle (2) the trace metal flux from the ash in the bed, and (3) the trace metal flux from the active alkali metal layer on the sand (and ash) particles in the bed. The amount of chlorine in the system, the combustion temperature, the fuel ash composition and the saturation state of the bed material in regard to trace metals were discovered to be key factors affecting therelease process. During the co-firing of waste fuels with variable amounts of e. g. ash and chlorine, it is extremely important to consider the possible ongoingaccumulation and/or release of the trace metals in the bed, when determining the flue gas trace metal emissions. If the state of the combustion process in regard to trace metals accumulation and/or release in the bed material is not known,it may happen that emissions from the bed material rather than the combustion of the fuel in question are measured and reported...|$|E

GHG contributions were categorized with respect to direct emissions from the combustion plant as well as indirect upstream contributions (e. g. provision of fuels and materials) and indirect downstream contributions (e. g. substitution of electricity and heat produced elsewhere). GHG accounting was done per tonne of waste received at the plant. The content of fossil carbon in the input waste, for example as plastic, {{was found to be}} crit-ical for the overall level of the GHG emissions, but also the energy conversion efficiencies were essential. The emission factors for electricity provision (also substituted electricity) affected the indirect downstream emissions with a factor of 3 – 9 {{depending on the type of}} electricity generation assumed. Provision of auxiliary fuels, materials and resources corresponded to up to 40 % of the direct emission from the plants (which were 347 – 371 kg CO 2 -eq. tonne – 1 of <b>waste</b> for <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> 735 – 803 kg CO 2 -eq. tonne – 1 of waste for co-combustion).

Different <b>incineration</b> technologies, <b>and</b> technology-specific performance regarding residues generation, are presented. Properties of different incineration residues, existing ash disposal strategy for the region and different alternative ash treatment strategies are also presented and discussed. An existing waste model for Central Norway is expanded to also include the amounts <b>and</b> flows of <b>incineration</b> residues generated in the region. The chemical composition of the residues is also accounted for. This dynamic waste model describe the development in <b>waste</b> generation <b>and</b> <b>incineration</b> residues generation, <b>and</b> is used as a basis for the further development of scenarios. To different scenarios are developed for <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> residues disposal for the region; a centralized waste incieration scenario with disposal of incinerator ashes to landfills (Scenario A), <b>and</b> a decentralized <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> scenario with regional vitrification of the incineration residues (Scenario B). These two scenarios’ potential environmental impacts are compared using life cycle assassment methodology. The timespan of this assessment starts in year 2002 and ends in 2020. The results from this assessment show that Scenario B clearly has the lowest overall potential for environmental impacts. The results also show that the impacts from the subprocesses connected to the residuals downstreams from the incineration, are of minor importance to the total impacts. An exception here is the impact category “terrestrial ecotoxicity”, where landfilling of bottom ash is the dominant contributor for the total impact potential for this impact category. The subprocesses connected to the residuals disposal/treatment for both scenarios have also been compared separately. This comparison showed {{that it is difficult to}} say which of the two residual strategies that has the best overall environmental performance. The landfilling strategy in Sceanrio A causes highest potential impacts for certain impact categories such as “terrestrial ecotoxicity” and “eutrophication”, while the vitrification strategy causes highest potential impacts for other impact categories such as “global warming potential” and “acidification”. A change in the residuals treatment strategy will thus not necessarily reduce the total potential for environmental harm, but instead change the main impacts from one impact category to another - a situation often reffered to as “problem shifting”. </p...|$|R

The approach involves monitoring the combustion conditions on the grate of boilers in order to determine flue gas conditions that {{will have an impact on}} energy recovery as well as plant performance from the materials perspective. Plant monitoring was also carried out using a cooled process probe whose main purpose was to collect solids from the flue gases of a range of power plants. The deposits were then available for use in laboratory and pilot plant corrosion tests. An innovative process sensor instrument is described. From the materials side, the results of a comprehensive study involving the collection of thermodynamic and kinetic data relevant to boiler materials corrosion, and the building of a model enabling the prediction of corrosion behaviour have been described and used for materials selection.
