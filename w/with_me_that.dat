There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will have to agree <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to work on your drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E

[...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream <b>With</b> <b>Me</b> <b>that</b> [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between November 2 and December 23, 1981. The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night {{to keep them from}} freezing. Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from Dallas, got along very well {{both on and off the}} set, Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, [...] "He has this dictatorial way of doing things <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom." [...] Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, [...] "Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead," [...] and walked off the set. Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.|$|E
500|$|Four {{weeks after}} the Rebel, Oxbow entered his last preparatory race before the Triple Crown campaign, the Grade I Arkansas Derby, held on April 13. This race {{marked the first time}} Oxbow was ridden by 50-year-old Stevens, who was Oxbow's seventh jockey in nine races. The horse was the {{favorite}} at 3–1, but once again drew an unfavorable, far-outside post at ten. Oxbow came out ninth at the break and was almost seven lengths behind the leader at the start. He had developed a reputation for running in front and wearing out his exercise riders, so Stevens unsuccessfully attempted to rate Oxbow and make him run off the pace, behind other horses. Oxbow, described by observers as [...] "very rank", and by Stevens as [...] "pissed off... upset <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he didn't get the running style he wanted", was tossing his head and fighting Stevens into the clubhouse turn. After running last {{at one point in the}} race, Oxbow improved his position and finished fifth, less than a length behind second-place Frac Daddy. [...] Oxbow earned a speed figure of 90, the same as in his maiden win. Stevens viewed his attempt to make Oxbow run off the pace as a mistake. [...] "It just turned out to be a nightmare trip and I take full (responsibility) for that", he said. Lukas agreed, stating, [...] "That will not be in [...] grandchildren's highlight film".|$|E
500|$|The group parted with Heart Management in March 1995 {{because of}} their {{frustration}} with the management company's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas. The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller, who signed them with 19 Entertainment. The group considered a variety of record labels, and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July. The original mix of [...] "Wannabe" [...] was considered lacklustre by the label's executives. Ashley Newton, {{who was in charge of}} A, sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve. As Halliwell later described it, [...] "the result was bloody awful." [...] She elaborated in her second autobiography, Just for the Record: [...] "Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls, [...] Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R group. He sent [...] "Wannabe" [...] over to America to be remixed by some hot R producers. He brought us jungle versions and hip-hop mixes and I hated them all. Although Mel B was a big fan of R, she agreed <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> these versions just didn't work so we exercised our Spice veto!" [...] Fuller gave the song to audio engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent, who thought that it was a [...] "weird pop record." [...] Stent remixed it in six hours, in what he described as [...] "tightening it up" [...] and [...] "getting the vocals sounding really good." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details."
