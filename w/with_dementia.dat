40|$|BACKGROUND: (123) I-FP-CIT SPECT (single photon {{emission}} computed tomography) {{can help in}} the differential diagnosis of probable <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies (Lewy body dementia) and Alzheimer's disease. AIMS: Our aim {{was to determine the}} accuracy of (123) I-FP-CIT SPECT in diagnosing people <b>with</b> possible <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies. METHOD: We undertook a 12 -month follow-up of 325 individuals with probable or possible Lewy body or non-Lewy body dementia who had previously undergone (123) I-FP-CIT SPECT. A consensus panel, masked to SPECT findings, established diagnosis at 12 months in 264 people. RESULTS: Of 44 people <b>with</b> possible <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies at baseline, at follow-up the diagnosis for 19 people was probable <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies (43 %), in 7 people non-Lewy body dementia (16 %) and for 18 individuals it remained possible <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies (41 %). Of the 19 who at follow-up were diagnosed <b>with</b> probable <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies, 12 had abnormal scans at baseline (sensitivity 63 %); all 7 individuals with a possible diagnosis who were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease at follow-up had normal scans (specificity 100 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the diagnostic accuracy of (123) I-FP-CIT SPECT in distinguishing Lewy body from non-Lewy body dementia and also suggest a clinically useful role in diagnostically uncertain cases, as an abnormal scan in a person <b>with</b> possible <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodies is strongly suggestive of <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> Lewy bodie...|$|R

5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD <b>with</b> <b>dementia.</b> The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people <b>with</b> <b>dementia,</b> a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E

40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects {{of physical activity}} on health care outcomes for aging populations, and more specifically for individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia,</b> have been well established by international researchers {{across a range of}} disciplines and care settings. The benefits for individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia</b> included improved daily functioning, sleep and mood, and decreased fears, disorientation, agitated pacing and restless circuiting (Weuve et a!. 2004; Zeisel 2006). Environmental design in residential accommodation was also recognised as an important therapeutic source to promote the well-being of older people, in particular individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia</b> (Marshall 1998; Powell et a!. 2000). Environmental design enhanced cognitive and physical capacities of individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia</b> (Parker eta!. 2004). It is therefore hypothesised that promoting physical activity levels among individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia</b> in residential accommodation will improve their health care outcomes. The focus of this chapter is the findings from (i) observation charts used to measure physical activity levels of individuals living <b>with</b> a <b>dementia</b> and (ii) audits to evaluate the environmental design of residential accommodation.

5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated <b>with</b> <b>dementia.</b> As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

The rate of nicotine dependence in Indian subjects <b>with</b> Vascular <b>Dementia</b> is not known. Hence we decided to assess Nicotine Dependence in subjects <b>with</b> Vascular <b>Dementia</b> Methods: Nicotine Dependence in subjects <b>with</b> Vascular <b>Dementia</b> was assessed among subjects presenting to Memory Clinic of a tertiary care hospital over a period of 16 months. Data regarding sociodemographic profile and severity of Nicotine Dependence as per Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Scale for smoking and smokeless tobacco was analysed using SPSS version 17. Results: Our study shows that in 159 subjects <b>with</b> Vascular <b>Dementia</b> Continuing Nicotine Dependence was seen in nearly 12 % of the subjects. Though the rates are less than the population prevalence for India, it is still relevant as nicotine is not just a risk factor for development of Vascular Dementia but severe nicotine dependence and longer duration of nicotine use were found to be poor prognostic factors associated <b>with</b> severe <b>dementia.</b> Further as all subjects continued to be nicotine dependent despite having been advised to quit tobacco, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive tobacco cessation intervention be offered to subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> to improve outcomes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Obesity is {{considered}} a public health challenge in South Asia. Obesity is an independent risk factor in vascular dementia. It also contributes to other risk factors of vascular dementia like hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. As the rate of obesity in Indian subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> is not known, we decided to assess obesity in subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia.</b> Methods: Subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> presenting to Memory Clinic of a tertiary care hospital {{over a period of}} 16 months were assessed for body mass index as a marker of obesity and for severity of dementia. Data obtained was analysed using SPSS version 17. Results: Our study shows that in 159 subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> about 17 % subjects were overweight and 68 % were obese. Only one subject was underweight. This is in excess of population prevalence of obesity in similar population. While {{there was no difference in}} age, education level and severity of <b>dementia</b> between subjects <b>with</b> normal weight, overweight and obesity, there was significant gender difference with females having more BMI than males in general and also across all levels of severity of dementia. This is in consonance with earlier studies showing female preponderance of obesity in subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia.</b> Conclusions: Obesity is common in subjects <b>with</b> vascular <b>dementia</b> especially in female subjects.
