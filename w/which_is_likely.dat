5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be more important}} than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E

5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased population movements, the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E
5|$|Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is {{an offence}} to make, publish or {{circulate}} any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment {{for up to three}} years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed if the person who made, published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true, and did not intend to incite one community against another.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} Moon race there were years of near quietude but {{starting}} in the 1990s, many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon. In 1990, Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its Hiten spacecraft. The spacecraft released a smaller probe, Hagoromo, in lunar orbit, but the transmitter failed, preventing further scientific use of the mission. In 1994, the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department/NASA spacecraft Clementine to lunar orbit. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface. This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to {{have been caused by}} the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.|$|E

5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be the next}} member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Palynology (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E

5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{to have been a}} true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also {{been compared to}} other possible supernova impostors such as SN 1961V, and to superluminous supernovae such as SN 2006gy.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge.

The first, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to run until late 2008, will focus on high-level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision {{at the end of the}} first phase, the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and culminate in a full public consultation in early 2010.|$|E
