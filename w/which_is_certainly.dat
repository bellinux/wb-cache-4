His father, a native of Lanark, {{had served as a}} soldier, losing an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy, and was admitted, first as an inmate, and {{afterwards}} as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. This employment, however, proved irksome to James, so he wandered about for a time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names. His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with aquatint, and a few using stipple technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth's works were the delight and study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney's naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.|$|E

500|$|The pumping {{engine for}} use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt's {{invention}} so that the engine had a rotary motion, making it suitable {{for use in}} mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect. [...] Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching {{the limits of the}} pumping engine market: [...] "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> an extensive field." [...] Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it {{at the end of the}} year. [...] One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. [...] George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. [...] As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. [...] While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a [...] "publicity stunt par excellence" [...] for the firm's latest innovation. [...] Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, [...] "spread far and wide", and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

I don't think it did him much good." [...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home.

2500|$|Lorde {{actively}} strived for {{the change}} of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal [...] "Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing the National Women's Studies Association," [...] it is stated that Lorde's speech contributed to communication with scholars' understanding of human biases. While [...] "anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture" [...] are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the [...] "white feminist" [...] audience. Lorde further explained that [...] "we are working {{in a context of}} oppression and threat, the cause of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not the angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people—against all of us who are seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the outset, the opera's {{depiction}} of African Americans attracted controversy. Problems with the racial {{aspects of the}} opera continue to this day. Virgil Thomson, a white American composer, stated that [...] "Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid {{as long as the}} folk in question is unable to speak for itself, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not true of the American Negro in 1935." [...] Duke Ellington was supposed to have stated [...] "the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms." [...] (Ellington's response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: [...] "Your Porgy and Bess the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest." [...] ) Several {{of the members of the}} original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a stereotype that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs and solved their problems with their fists.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that it is unlikely that these items were intended to be used for ordinary domestic dining, and that their eventual deposition may be interpreted as a ritual act rather than a practical one (See Religion in Ancient Rome). [...] However, since both pagan and Christian inscriptions are regularly found on Roman jewellery and domestic tableware, and as the actual motivation for the concealment of the Thetford material itself is unknown, this view is open to debate. [...] The unusual composition of the group of gold objects is actually somewhat better evidence of a non-domestic background than the decoration and inscriptions of the silver assemblage (see comments on the range of finger-rings in the following section). [...] The suspicion that the hoard is incomplete undermines any detailed analysis of these matters, but if the gold and silver objects were connected in any way with pagan cult practices, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a possibility, then the anti-pagan Theodosian edicts of the 390s would have provided good practical (rather than ritual) reasons for the concealment of the material from the authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Christian Science Monitor {{staff writer}} Dan Murphy interviewed the {{spokeswoman}} for the Red Cross, Cecilia Goin, who said the comments were not provided in full context and thus gave the inaccurate impression [...] "that everything was OK" [...] when in fact the situation was still [...] "dire."
