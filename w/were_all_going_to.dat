25|$|Josiah Dann, a tramcar conductor, {{was summoned}} on 2 August 1883 for having carried 28 {{passengers}} {{when the car}} was only licensed for 24. The officer noticed the tramcar in Carrington Street drawn by one horse and counted the passengers. When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop {{and some of the}} passengers got out. The conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Air Force {{had started a}} {{research}} project into future interceptor aircraft that eventually settled on an advanced specification known as the 1954 interceptor. Contracts for this specification eventually resulted {{in the selection of}} the F-102 Delta Dagger, but by 1952 it was becoming clear that none of the parts of the specification other than the airframe would be ready by 1954; the engines, weapons and fire control systems <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take too long to get into service. An effort was then started to quickly produce an interim supersonic design to replace the various subsonic interceptors then in service, and the F-101 airframe was selected as a starting point.|$|E

500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will; but we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give something. I headed {{the paper with}} my five dollars; for if it <b>is</b> done at <b>all,</b> it must <b>be</b> done handsome." ...|$|R
6000|$|So you young gentlemen up in London <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> examined, are you?' said he; 'what {{is it to}} be about? Who's to {{be first}} {{lieutenant}} of the ship, is that it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course; we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{part of the}} audience,' said Lady Windermere; 'and now, Mr. Podgers, be {{sure and}} tell us {{something}} nice. Lord Arthur {{is one of my}} special favourites.' ...|$|R
60|$|But here Mr. Fyshe was understating the case. They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{live to see}} it, {{right on}} the spot.|$|E
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work; {{she also}} was going to work. Her ticket was the same. She sat trying {{to fit in with}} them. But fear was at her bowels, she felt an unknown, terrible grip upon her.|$|E
60|$|There was college ahead; {{that was}} her mid-air, unknown, spacious. Come college, {{and she would have}} broken from the {{confines}} of all the life she had known. For her father was also going to move. They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave Cossethay.|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, laughing; [...] "a yacht, the Kittiwake. Sir Robert Audley has lent {{it to my}} brother, and we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see the Hebrides and Staffa and Iona." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{may have}} been forced," [...] said the Colonel gently. [...] "They {{must be at least}} a hundred strong, for which reason we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see my friend Renard, who has a motor-car." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "I suppose so. There is {{very little}} {{travelling}} in Switzerland except pleasure travelling. I presume they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the mountains and the}} other scenery of the country." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} the clock struck {{thirteen}} four times and this cheered her up. She said that if we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, it did not so much matter. Most likely there was a fever or a plague coming, and {{we should all be}} taken together.|$|E
60|$|So Mrs. Orange took up {{her baby}} and went home, {{and told the}} family that plagued her so that they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sent to school. They said they didn't {{want to go to}} school; but she packed up their boxes, and packed them off.|$|E
60|$|This {{time he was}} sure: Dame Fortune {{would rise}} like Persephone out of the earth. He {{was all the more}} sure, because other men of the town were in with him at this venture: sound, moneyed grocers and plumbers. They <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become rich.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Hans felt {{a little}} better he might look after Dick, {{but he is still}} as sick as ever," [...] said Tom. [...] "He {{declares}} we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the bottom and he doesn't care if we do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Watching {{the wooden}} folks. They're too funny for anything, Dorothy. Just now they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed, and--what do you think?--they unhook the hinges of their wings {{and put them}} in a corner until they wake up again." ...|$|R
25|$|Stoever: He {{is the one}} who guesses they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. The {{other members}} of the group prevent him from {{following}} Morel when he leaves the aquarium. He calms down and the group's fanaticism towards Morel prevails over his own survival instinct.|$|R
60|$|Rectus and I {{could hardly}} {{go in to}} supper, and we got through the meal in short order. We staid out on deck until after eleven o'clock, and Corny staid with us {{a good part of}} the time. At last, her father came down after her, for they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E
60|$|We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{the party}} at Highclose. I {{happened}} {{to go into}} the kitchen about half past seven. The lamp was turned low, and Rebecca sat in the shadows. On the table, {{in the light of the}} lamp, I saw a glass vase with five or six very beautiful Christmas roses.|$|E
60|$|So {{then the}} king gave a great ball, {{to bring all}} the chief men of the country {{together}} to try would the shoe fit any of them. And they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> carpenters and joiners getting bits of their feet cut off to try could they wear the shoe, {{but it was no}} use, not one of them could get it on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cadurcis,' {{said his}} cousin to him one morning, 'we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Hampton Court. Now is your time; Lady Annabel, the Vernons, and myself, will fill one carriage; I have {{arranged}} that. Look out, and something may be done. Speak to the Countess.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 17 July, Thursday, Koné {{spoke to}} the media once again {{regarding}} his drawn-out transfer saga. He stated: [...] "It's heading down a good road, I hope that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done quickly. The {{important thing is that}} the two clubs reach an understanding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{make the}} whole thing worse! No. You <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cross the range. You can start out as if for a little turn round the valley, and just {{naturally}} keep going. It can't do any harm, and it may save a nasty time in court." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} that the lads had forgotten to write to the Stanhopes and the Lanings, and to their college friends. Numerous letters had been mailed and about an equal number had been received. The girls <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Hope, but one week later than the boys would have to depart for Brill. Nothing more had been seen or heard of Crabtree or Sobber, for which all were thankful.|$|E
60|$|And {{then they}} started. The road from Le Puy to Polignac is nearly all up hill; {{and a very}} steep hill it is, {{so that there was}} plenty of time for conversation. But the girls had it nearly all to themselves. Mimmy thought that she had never found M. Lacordaire so stupid; and Lilian told her sister on the first safe {{opportunity}} that occurred, that it seemed very much as though they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He cannot if he would. Everything is entailed, and {{you know}} how my aunt served us. There is no ready money to be had, not even the five {{thousand}} pounds that is the whole dependence for the poor things at home in case of my death, which may come soon enough for aught I care. I wish it was! I wish we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the bottom together, and I was to see none of their faces again. It would be better for Violet than this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mehemet Ali has agreed," [...] said he. [...] "He {{has gone}} to put the nose-rope upon three more of the camels. But it is foolishness, and we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> our death. Now come with me, and we shall awaken the women and tell them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't exactly mean that, father; but I {{think one}} {{would like to}} know how he would wish it to be done before we do anything. There is no {{particular}} hurry, you know, when he once knows that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> set right." ...|$|R
5000|$|For some, {{the mere}} idea of reading as a {{communal}} activity is repellent. The literary critic Harold Bloom said, [...] "I don't like these mass reading bees.... It is {{rather like the}} idea that we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once." ...|$|R
