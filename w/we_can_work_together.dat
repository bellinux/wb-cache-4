[...] The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. [...] "If you’re {{going to be the}} official Opposition leader," [...] she said, [...] "you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier.

Gmul was an investment holding company with stakes in real estate, hotels, investments, and automotive. It was founded in 1950 by Bank Hapoalim, the Histadrut labor federation and several pension funds then sold to the brothers Jules and Eddy Trump, who listed it on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and then later sold in October 2003 to Eyal Yona and Amnon Barzilay. Performance at Gmul quickly deteriorated. Recanati stated: [...] "At this point I can say that buying control of Gmul was the worst deal I have ever made in my long career, and I have lost {{more than any other}} Gmul share or bond investor.

CCC is a three day interactive program that provides a ‘snapshot’ of environmental education in WA. Participants come from community groups, youth organisations, teachers, preservice teachers, private sector, and local and state government.
