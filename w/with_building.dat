5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned <b>with</b> <b>building</b> infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{what is now}} Great Marlborough Street was land {{belonging}} to the Mercer's Company. It was surrendered to Henry VIII in 1536.

In 1670, Maddox's son, Benjamin, let the land to James Kendrick for 72 years, who in turn sub-let what is now Great Marlborough Street to John Steele.

5|$|Several {{portions}} of modern NY38 were originally part of turnpikes and plank roads during the 1800s. On April13, 1819, the New York State Legislature {{passed a law}} incorporating the Cortland and Owego Turnpike Company. The company was tasked <b>with</b> <b>building</b> a highway—the Cortland and Owego Turnpike—from Owego north to the then-village of Cortland. It roughly followed what is now NY38 north from Owego to the vicinity of Harford, where it turned north to access Virgil. It continued to Cortland by way of modern NY215.|$|E

5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on <b>with</b> <b>building</b> Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
