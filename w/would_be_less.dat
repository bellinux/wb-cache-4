5|$|Yttrium {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in the yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') superconductor developed at the University of Alabama and the University of Houston in 1987. This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above liquid nitrogen's boiling point (77.1K). Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E

5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation.

Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute.

5|$|The film {{suffered}} setbacks {{in development}} in December 2002. Rudin left Unfortunate Events over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount's $100million budget. The studio decided that changing the shoot from Hollywood to Wilmington, North Carolina <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> expensive. The April 2003 start date was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled {{the situation in}} January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director's position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - so only a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less.</b> This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{many factors}} were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such factor was {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> inclined to marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important political decisions.|$|E
5|$|With the NIE reports {{suggesting}} {{the existence of}} the gap Gaither predicted, near panic broke out in military circles. In response, the US began to rush its own ICBM efforts, centered on the SM-65 Atlas. These missiles <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> susceptible to attack by Soviet ICBMs than their existing bomber fleet, especially in future versions which would be launched from underground silos. But even as Atlas was rushed, it appeared there would be a missile gap; NIE estimates made during the late 1950s suggested the Soviets would have significantly more ICBMs than the US between 1959 and 1963, at which point US production would finally catch up.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original.|$|E
