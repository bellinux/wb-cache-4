5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with <b>washable</b> paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 Bruce Willis action film A Good Day to Die Hard, a Mil Mi-26T, leased {{from the}} Belarus Ministry for Emergency Situations and painted in <b>washable</b> {{military}} camouflage, {{was used in}} various scenes.|$|E
25|$|In the past, a woman's corset {{was usually}} worn over a chemise, a {{sleeveless}} low-necked gown made of <b>washable</b> material (usually cotton or linen). It absorbed perspiration {{and kept the}} corset and the gown clean. In modern times, a tee shirt, camisole or corset liner may be worn.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Binney & Smith {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Silly Putty, a stretchy bouncy toy. Crayola markers were introduced in 1978 {{to coincide with the}} 75th anniversary of Crayola crayons. In 1984, the company was acquired by Hallmark Cards, a privately held corporation. Colored pencils and a line of <b>washable</b> markers were added in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, new philosophies of child-rearing led to clothes that were thought {{especially}} suitable for children. Toddlers wore <b>washable</b> dresses called frocks of linen or cotton. British and American boys after perhaps three began to wear rather short pantaloons and short jackets, and for very young boys the skeleton suit was introduced. These gave {{the first real}} alternative to boys' dresses, and became fashionable across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the FJ features many design elements focused on enhancing off-road practicality. All interior surfaces are covered with <b>washable</b> rubber materials to aid in fast cleanup after heavy outdoor use. The FJ also incorporates oversized controls to aid drivers with gloved hands. The three-gauge cluster (with compass, temperature, and inclinometer) {{as well as the}} 110-volt rear outlet were carried over from the FJ Cruiser concept vehicle as options on the final production model.|$|E
25|$|Specialty diapers are {{required}} for swimming or pool therapy. These are known as swim diapers or containment swim briefs. They are intended mainly for fecal incontinence, however {{they can also be}} useful for temporary urine containment, to maintain dignity while transferring from change room to pool. Manufacturers such as Discovery Trekking, Splash About and Theraquatics commonly utilize a stretch fabric to allow increased adjustability for a snug fit. They are <b>washable</b> and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim diapers.|$|E
25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of <b>washable</b> {{seersucker}} material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves were white, and the handbags were light green. The summer dress uniform was made of white twill. It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first was the white one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps. The other two were made of white twill or palm-beach material. One was a short-sleeved blouse, {{and the other was}} long sleeved and collarless.|$|E
25|$|The first {{sewing machine}} emerged in 1790, and later, Josef Madersperger began {{developing}} his first sewing machine in 1807, presenting his first working machine in 1814. The {{introduction of the}} sewing machine sped up garment production. Meanwhile, advanced spinning, weaving and cotton-printing techniques developed in the 18th century had already brought detailed, <b>washable</b> fabrics. These durable and affordable fabrics became popular among the majority population. These techniques were further developed {{by the introduction of}} machines. Before, accessories like embroidery and lace were manufactured on a small and limited scale by skilled craftsmen and sold in their own shops; in 1804, a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan, and people started producing these essential accessories in factories and dispatching the products to shops throughout the country. These technical developments in clothing production allowed a greater variety of styles; rapid changes in fashion also became possible.|$|E
500|$|The non-toxic, non-staining, {{reusable}} {{modeling compound}} {{that came to}} be known as [...] "Play-Doh" [...] was a pliable, putty-like substance concocted by Noah McVicker of Cincinnati-based soap manufacturer Kutol Products. It was devised at the request of Kroger Grocery, which wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper. [...] Following World War II, with the transition from coal-based home heating to natural gas and the resulting decrease in internal soot, and the introduction of <b>washable</b> vinyl-based wallpaper, the market for wallpaper cleaning putty decreased substantially. McVicker's nephew, Joe McVicker, joined Kutol with the remit to save the company from bankruptcy. Joe McVicker was the brother-in-law of nursery school teacher Kay Zufall, and Zufall had seen a newspaper article about making art projects with the wallpaper cleaning putty. Her students enjoyed it, and she persuaded Bill Rhodenbaugh (who also sold the putty) and Joe McVicker to manufacture it as a child’s toy. Zufall and her husband came up with the name Play-Doh; Joe McVicker and Rhodenbaugh had wanted to call it [...] "Rainbow Modeling Compound".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to creating Li'l Abner, Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: Abbie an' Slats with magazine illustrator Raeburn van Buren in 1937, and Long Sam with cartoonist Bob Lubbers in 1954, {{as well as}} the Sunday [...] "topper" [...] strips <b>Washable</b> Jones, Small Fry (a.k.a. Small Change), and Advice fo' Chillun.|$|E
2500|$|Very small girls wore their skirts {{just below}} knee-length over pantalettes. Skirts became very {{gradually}} longer as girls grew up {{until they reached}} ankle length at coming-out (in their later teens, usually 16-18). Older girls wore hoops to hold out their skirts. Young girls wore <b>washable</b> pinafores over their dresses for work and play to keep them clean, as typified by the eponymous heroine of Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel, and her Alice in Wonderland dress [...]|$|E
2500|$|Acrylic is a {{synthetic}} material first {{created by the}} Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or [...] "pill" [...] easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics {{have been developed to}} alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, <b>washable,</b> and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, women's {{underwear}} {{consisted of}} a <b>washable</b> linen chemise or smock. This was the only article of clothing that was worn by every woman, regardless of class. Wealthy women's smocks were embroidered and trimmed with narrow lace. [...] Smocks were made of rectangular lengths of linen; in northern Europe the smock skimmed the body and was widened with triangular gores, while in Mediterranean countries smocks were cut fuller {{in the body and}} sleeves. [...] High-necked smocks were worn under high-necked fashions, to protect the expensive outer garments from body oils and dirt. There is pictorial evidence that Venetian courtesans wore linen or silk drawers, but no evidence that drawers were worn in England.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "St Michael" [...] brand was {{introduced}} by Simon Marks in 1928 in honour {{of his father and}} co-founder of Marks & Spencer, Michael Marks. By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the St Michael brand. M lingerie, women's clothing and girls' uniform were branded under the St Margaret brand, until the whole range of general merchandise became St Michael. The synthetic fibre Tricell was first used in 1957 and lasted until the 1970s. and another synthetic fibre called Courtelle was first launched, nationally, by Marks & Spencer during 1960 and also lasted well into the 1970s. Machine <b>washable</b> wool first appeared in 1972 and Lycra hosiery first came in during 1986.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} a {{separate}} line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned Toby Press, including Shmoo Comics featuring <b>Washable</b> Jones. Cartoonist Mell Lazarus, creator of Miss Peach and Momma, wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled The Boss Is Crazy, Too which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the Charles Schulz Museum on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby [...] "the five funniest years of my life." [...] Lazarus went on to cite Capp {{as one of the}} [...] "four essentials" [...] in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz and Milton Caniff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marketing}} campaign by both Earhart and Putnam {{was successful in}} establishing the Earhart mystique in the public psyche. Rather than simply endorsing the products, Earhart actively {{became involved in the}} promotions, especially in women's fashions. For a number of years she had sewn her own clothes, but the [...] "active living" [...] lines that were sold in 50 stores such as Macy's in metropolitan areas were an expression of a new Earhart image. Her concept of simple, natural lines matched with wrinkle-proof, <b>washable</b> materials was the embodiment of a sleek, purposeful but feminine [...] "A.E." [...] (the familiar name she went by with family and friends). The luggage line that she promoted (marketed as Modernaire Earhart Luggage) also bore her unmistakable stamp.|$|E
2500|$|The {{layers of}} the quilt are then {{stitched}} together, either by hand or {{through the use of}} a sewing machine or longarm. One method of quilting involves the use of an outline or stencil applied to the surface of the quilt using fabric chalk, <b>washable</b> marker or iron-on pattern. [...] The quilter will then sew along the applied pattern, washing or wiping the stencil off after the quilt is complete. Some quilters choose not to make use of a pattern. Free-motion quilting is the process of quilting without the use of a stencil or other guide, requiring a steady hand and a great deal of practice. Quilting is usually completed by starting from the middle, and moving outward toward the edges of the quilt. Quilting can be elaborately decorative, comprising stitching fashioned into complex designs and patterns, simple or complex geometric grids, [...] "motifs" [...] traced from published quilting patterns or traced pictures, freehand, or complex repeated designs called tessellations. The quilter may choose to emphasize these designs by using threads that are multicolored or metallic, or that contrast highly to the fabric. Conversely, the quilter may choose to make the quilting disappear, using [...] "invisible" [...] nylon or polyester thread, thread that matches the quilt top, or stitching within the patchwork seams themselves (commonly known as [...] "stitch in the ditch").|$|E
2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a {{hook and loop}} fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a protective padding of roll cotton or a premade quilted pad. [...] The bandage is started {{on the outside of}} the leg, in the middle of the cannon bone, then wrapped down to either the fetlock or the hoof, depending on the purpose for which it is used, then back up to just under the knee, then back to the center of the cannon just above the starting point, ending {{on the outside of the}} leg. [...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable stretchable wrap that sticks to itself, or with <b>washable</b> fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a hook and loop closure. [...] Bandages may also be taped with medical tape to help them stay on.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Morris washed {{everything}} <b>washable</b> in the house, and did up Fay's frocks so daintily {{that she}} looked more like an elf than ever when her head shone out from the fluted frills, like the yellow middle of a daisy with its white petals all spread.|$|E
60|$|But, {{tears were}} not the things {{to find their way}} to Mr. Bumble's soul; his heart was waterproof. Like <b>washable</b> beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were {{rendered}} stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.|$|E
60|$|He had {{straight}} black hair, parted up {{the middle}} of his head and hanging down upon his coat; a little fringe of hair upon his chin; wore no neckcloth; a white hat; a suit of black, long in the sleeves and short in the legs; soiled brown stockings and laced shoes. His complexion, naturally muddy, was rendered muddier by too strict an economy of soap and water; and the same observation will apply to the <b>washable</b> part of his attire, which he might have changed with comfort to himself and gratification to his friends. He was about five and thirty; was crushed and jammed up in a heap, under the shade of a large green cotton umbrella; and ruminated over his tobacco-plug like a cow.|$|E
60|$|No {{one of the}} McKay {{household}} {{ever thought}} of giving Old Peg anything {{in the shape of}} work to do, for the very good reason that, being an extremely willing horse, she was always working; and she possessed a peculiar faculty of observation, which enabled her to perceive, long before any one else, what ought to be done, and the right time to do it, so that, when any one bounced round with the sudden intention of telling her to do anything, Old Peg was found to have done it already, or to be in the act of doing it. It is almost superfluous to say that she patched and mended the household garments, washed the most of things <b>washable,</b> sewed the sewable, darned the sock, and, generally, did-up the whole McKay family. When not engaged in definite or specific work, she had a chronic sock-knitting which helped to fill up and round off the corners of her leisure hours.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is no good}} pretending about it. The war {{has ended}} all that. Boon died with his age. After the war {{there will be a}} new sort of book-trade and a crop of new writers and a fresh tone, and {{everything}} will be different. This is an obituary, of more than George Boon.... I regard the outlook with profound dismay. I try to keep my mind off it by drilling with the Shrewsbury last line of volunteers and training down the excrescences of my physical style. When the war is over will be time enough to consider the prospects of a superannuated man of letters. We National Volunteers are now no mere soldiers on paper; we have fairly <b>washable</b> badges by way of uniform; we have bought ourselves dummy rifles; we have persuaded the War Office to give us a reluctant recognition on the distinct understanding that we have neither officers nor authority. In the event of an invasion, I understand, we are to mobilize and ... do quite a number of useful things. But until there is an invasion in actual progress, nothing is to be decided more precisely than what this whiff of printer's shrapnel, these four full stops, conveys....|$|E
