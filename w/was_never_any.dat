5|$|Michele Greene {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} with AfterEllen.com that her kiss with Amanda Donohoe's C. J. was a ratings ploy and that there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> intention on the part of producers to seriously explore the possibility of a relationship between two women.|$|E

Although it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> week's top-grossing film, it {{remained in the}} top 10 through July. Its theatrical run continued through December 10, shortly before the DVD release.|$|E

5|$|In the Railway Plan of 1923, Parliament {{decided to}} extend the Nordland Line from Fauske to Vadsø with a branch to Kirkenes. During the Second World War, the Wehrmacht revitalized the {{plans to build a}} railway to Kirkenes. No more than the {{unfinished}} Polar Line was built and there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> railways built north of Narvik and the Ofoten Line. However, detailed plans were made for the line, including surveying geological conditions and choice of the route.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po {{were found on the}} hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched radioactive materials. Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E
5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E

5|$|Jason Michael Kipnis {{was born}} on April 3, 1987 in Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He was the fourth child born to Kay and Mark Kipnis. He has two older brothers, Blair and Todd. His older sister Amanda played {{softball}} at the University of Maryland. As a child, his father {{played an important role}} in his baseball life. He played Little League and American Legion Baseball. Though Kipnis played baseball, football and soccer while growing up, he said there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> question that his goal was to become a professional baseball player.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E
5|$|In the 1937 season, Hammond scored 3,252 runs at {{an average}} of 65.04, passing 3,000 runs a second time, and taking 48 wickets. In the three Tests against New Zealand, he passed the {{previous}} record number of England appearances, overtaking Frank Woolley's 64 Tests. While scoring 140 in the first Test, he passed the total number of runs scored by Jack Hobbs to become the leading run scorer in Tests, a record he held until it was broken by Colin Cowdrey in December 1970. This innings was his only score above fifty in the series, in which he scored 204 runs (average 51). At the end of the season, in November 1937, it was announced that he had accepted a job, joining the Marsham Tyres board of directors, meaning he would play as an amateur in the future. This led to immediate speculation that he would be made captain of England in the 1938 Ashes series. The chairman of selectors, Plum Warner, later wrote that there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> doubt from then that Hammond would be captain.|$|E

5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Hardy gained {{attention}} for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches, making {{a name for}} himself {{as one of the most}} seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Van Dam on two separate occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led to Matt demanding a match at Vengeance, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt by pinfall at Vengeance, while Matt's foot was on the ropes, Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match and lost. After the match, The Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker attacked Matt as well, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble, because WWF did not have another storyline for their characters. The Hardys later came back as a team, and there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> mention of their previous storyline split.|$|E

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> formal salvage of the site. However, {{since the}} {{invention}} of recreational SCUBA diving in the 1960s, looters have been frequenting the site and noticeable materials have been removed. Such materials that have been targeted are non-ferrous materials, such as copper alloy piping off the boilers and any interesting personal artefacts. Looters have also used explosives on the site, including destroying the propeller blades.|$|E
25|$|The term White Australia policy {{comprises}} various historical {{policies that}} effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> specific policy titled as such, but {{the term was}} invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia. These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.|$|E

25|$|Elk Island National Park is {{situated}} in the Beaverhills area, which with its aspen thickets and easy access to water, has provided shelter for wintering herds of elk, bison and moose since times immemorial.

25|$|By 1978–79, up to 70% of {{the regular}} army was {{composed}} of black soldiers (though both the army and police reserves remained overwhelmingly white).

While there <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>any</b> suggestion of disloyalty among the soldiers from predominantly black units (in particular within the Selous Scouts or the Rhodesian African Rifles – RAR), some argue that, {{by the time of}} the 1980 election, many of the RAR soldiers voted for Robert Mugabe.|$|E
