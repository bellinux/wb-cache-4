In addition, the prohibition on new free-to-air broadcasters would be extended until December 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Rep. Barletta, who {{sponsored}} the bill, {{argued that it}} is necessary because the Internal Revenue Service had initially said that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>requiring</b> organizations to provide these volunteers with insurance, something that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prohibitively expensive for some of them. The Department of the Treasury, which the IRS is part of, announced on January 10 that these volunteers <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to <b>be</b> provided with insurance, but supporters still wanted to make that [...] "crystal clear in statute" [...] instead of relying on a mere rule.|$|R
5|$|After the Columbia accident, NASA {{decided that}} two test flights <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> and that {{activities}} that were originally assigned to STS-114 {{would need to}} be divided into two missions because of the addition of post-Columbia safety tests.|$|E
5|$|CAPCOM Dan Burbank {{advised the}} crew that the damage did not {{initially}} {{appear to be}} serious, but assured the crew that the image analysis team would be reviewing the imagery further, and engineers on the ground would be analyzing it {{to determine if a}} focused inspection <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{originally}} planned to create {{many of the}} aliens with computer graphics, but those {{that would be more}} cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimodians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required,</b> {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a further}} qualification: Only the {{negative}} commandments could potentially be considered a matter of yehareg v'al ya'avor; one <b>would</b> never <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to sacrifice himself {{for one of the}} positive commandments. Since refraining from the performance of a positive commandment involves no specific action, to do so <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> considered a desecration of God's name, so self-sacrifice <b>would</b> never <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> with {{no need for}} spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the cavalry}} are {{usually in the}} 1,000–3,000 range. The Persian cavalry was usually {{provided}} by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The fleet must {{have had at least}} some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to carry 1,000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|George {{objected to}} the anti-Catholic wording of the Accession Declaration that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to make {{at the opening of}} his first {{parliament}}.

5|$|More {{efficient}} {{weapons would}} require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b> At {{the time of}} Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
5|$|National, {{local and}} {{regional}} DAB ensembles use the same frequency for the area they cover. Using a single-frequency network, an ensemble broadcasting a number of stations can cover the same area {{as a number of}} FM frequencies which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to cover the same area for one station. The BBC carried out successful tests of a single-frequency network in London before launching its national DAB ensemble.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required,</b> so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 qualification test flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
