500|$|Investigators {{discovered}} an impurity and fatigue {{crack in the}} disk. Titanium reacts with air when melted, which creates impurities which can initiate fatigue cracks like that found in the crash disk. To prevent this, the ingot that would become the fan disk was formed using a [...] "double vacuum" [...] process: the raw materials were melted together in a vacuum, allowed to cool and solidify, then melted in a vacuum once more. After the double vacuum process, the ingot was shaped into a billet, a sausage-like form about 16 inches in diameter, and tested using ultrasound to look for defects. Defects were located and the ingot <b>was</b> <b>further</b> <b>processed</b> to remove them, but some contamination remained.

50|$|Tiwest's {{corporate}} office (sales/marketing/accounting/administration/IT/etc) {{was located in}} Bentley, five minutes drive south of the Perth central business district. During the joint-venture phase of operations, from 1988 through 2012, heavy mineral concentrate was trucked from Cooljarloo, 1 hour and 15 minutes south to the Chandala mineral sands processing plant, near Muchea, 70 km north of Perth. The concentrate was then separated in a facility known as a dry mill, using a magnetic separation-process. Ilmenite <b>was</b> <b>further</b> <b>processed</b> on-site into synthetic rutile, which is used by pigment plants to manufacture paints and similar products. Additional minerals, produced as a byproduct of the rutile production process, were sold as-is. Most synthetic rutile from Chandala was then trucked to Kwinana, 30 km south of Perth, to the Tiwest-owned pigment plant, which produces titanium dioxide a.k.a. TiO2. A $100M upgrade to this Kwinana pigment plant {{was approved by the}} boards of both Tronox and Exxaro, and was expected to increase TiO2 pigment production by up to 50% before 2013. TiO2 is the best commercially viable whiting agent known, and is typically used in the manufacture of paints, plastics, and food stuffs.|$|E

The Heerespersonalamt (HPA—Army Staff Office) received the nomination for the Oak Leaves from the commander-in-chief of the 9. Armee Theodor Busse via teleprinter message on 21 April 1945 announcing that a detailed statement with explanations will follow. This nomination went to the chief of the HPA in Berlin and to the Army Group Vistula. Major Joachim Domaschk noted on 28 April: [...] "Waiting for announced statement!". The nomination list of the higher grade of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves notes the entry date of 19 March 1945. This is the date when the nomination was sent. An almost unreadable comment states [...] "Waiting". According to Fellgiebel a note claims [...] "service proposal regarding immediate presentation pending". Scherzer does not confirm this entry but states that a comment [...] "Waiting for announced statement" [...] is noted instead. No further comments indicate that the nomination <b>was</b> <b>further</b> <b>processed.</b> According to the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) the award was presented in accordance with the Dönitz-decree. This is illegal according to the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) and lacks legal justification.|$|E
