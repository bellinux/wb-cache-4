5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public <b>war</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E
5|$|The local {{branch of}} the TGWU refused {{to meet with a}} {{delegation}} from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter <b>war</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> was fought out in the local media. Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union, persuaded a local black TGWU member, Bill Smith, to sign a statement which called for quiet negotiation to solve the dispute. It condemned Stephenson for causing potential harm to the city's black and Asian population. Nethercott launched an attack on Stephenson in the Daily Herald newspaper, calling him dishonest and irresponsible. This led to a libel case in the High Court, which awarded Stephenson damages and costs in December 1963.|$|E

5|$|The <b>war</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions {{were on the}} brink of civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge in Vermont was brief, he {{continued}} to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a <b>war</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry <b>war</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E

However it does seem that Staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes. H. J. R.

40|$|<b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>Words</b> is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} survey {{of the politics of}} language in Ireland during the colonial and post-colonial periods. Challenging received notions, Tony Crowley presents a complex, fascinating, and often surprising history which has suffered greatly in the past from over-simplification. Beginning with Henry VIII 2 ̆ 7 s Act for English Order, Habit, and Language (1537) and ending with the Republic of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s Official Languages Act (2003) and the introduction of language rights under the legislation proposed by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (2004), this clear and accessible narrative follows the continuities and discontinuities of Irish history over the past five hundred years. The major issues that have both united and divided Ireland are considered with regard to language, including ethnicity, cultural identity, religion, sovereignty, propriety, purity, memory, and authenticity. But rather than simply presenting the accepted wisdom on many of the language debates, this book re-visits the material and considers previously little-known evidence in order to offer new insights and to contest earlier accounts. The materials range from colonial state papers to the writings of Irish revolutionaries, from the work of Irish priest historians to contemporary loyalist politicians, from Gaelic dictionaries to Ulster-Scots poetry. <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>Words</b> offers a reading of the crucial role language has played in Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s political history. It concludes by arguing that the Belfast Agreement 2 ̆ 7 s recognition that languages are 2 ̆ 7 part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland 2 ̆ 7, will be central to the social development of the Republic and Northern Ireland. The final chapter analyses the way in which contemporary poets have used Gaelic, Hiberno-English, Ulster-English, and Ulster-Scots, as vehicles for the various voices that demand to be heard in the new societies {{on both sides of the}} border.

Then perhaps the baffled opponent will shout out Wahhid, i.e., “Attest the unity of the Deity”; when, instead of employing the usual religious phrases to assert that dogma, he will briefly ejaculate “Al,” and hurry on with the course of conversation. As it may be supposed, these <b>wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> frequently end in violent quarrels; for, to do the Madani justice, they are always ready to fight. The desperate old feud between the “Juwwa,” and the “Barra,”—the town and the suburbs—has been put down with the greatest difficulty. The boys, indeed, still keep it up, turning out in bodies and making determined onslaughts with sticks and stones.[FN#31] ...|$|R

As a result of the new political reality, the Iraqi media was divided into ethno-sectarian lines, resulting from previous policies followed by the US administration. This article argues that the US media policy prior and after the US invasion of Iraq played a part in enhancing and encouraging the sectarian divisions in the Iraqi society. This was mainly done by sending biased media messages through the state-run Iraqi Media Network (IMN) and other US-aligned channels and allowing militant voices from different Iraqi sides to wage <b>wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> without interfering. In fact, the only time US officials interfered is when they were criticized by Iraqi media outlets.
