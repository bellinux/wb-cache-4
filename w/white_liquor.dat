40|$|There {{are a few}} {{possible}} ways {{to produce}} ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, for instance, thermochemical and acid hydrolysis. However, enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates is considered the greenest process for saccharification, followed by sugar fermentation into ethanol. The main challenge of the enzymatic saccharification process is that cellulose is not exposed to the enzyme action in the lignin matrix. The cellulose molecules are arranged in semi-crystalline nanofibrils immersed in lignin matrix with hemicelluloses (polyoses) and extractives between them acting as coupling agents. These nanofibrils are placed together to form helical microfibrils inside the cell wall. Thus, a pre-treatment is necessary {{to make room for}} the enzymes to reach the cellulose fibril surfaces in order for the whole process to become economically feasible. There are many pre-treatments proposed in specialized literature, but their efficiencies are dependent on the biomass composition [1 - 4]. Moreover, these treatments have to address some constraints such as the recyclability of the chemicals used, low consumption of energy, and sustainability concerns. We devised a future possibility of a cellulose pulp mill to be transformed into a biorefinary, where besides cellulose pulp, ethanol could also be produced. In the Brazilian pulp mill industry, the process most commonly used is the Kraft process, so the digestion with green and <b>white</b> <b>liquors</b> can be adapted for pre-treatment towards enzymatic saccharification.

40|$|Gasification {{of black}} liquor (BLG) has {{distinct}} advantages over direct combustion in Tomlinson recovery boilers. In this project {{we seek to}} resolve causticizing issues {{in order to make}} pressurized BLG even more efficient and cost-effective. One advantage of BLG is that the inherent partial separation of sulfur and sodium during gasification lends itself to the use of proven high yield variants to conventional kraft pulping which require just such a separation. Processes such as polysulfide, split sulfidity, ASAQ, and MSSAQ can increase pulp yield from 1 % to 10 % over conventional kraft but require varying degrees of sulfur/sodium separation, which requires additional [and costly] processing in a conventional Tomlinson recovery process. However during gasification, the sulfur is partitioned between the gas and smelt phases, while the sodium all leaves in the smelt; thus creating the opportunity to produce sulfur-rich and sulfur-lean <b>white</b> <b>liquors</b> for specialty pulping processes. A second major incentive of BLG is the production of a combustible product gas, rich in H 2 and CO. This product gas (a. k. a. “syngas”) can be used in gas turbines for combined cycle power generation (which is twice as efficient as the steam cycle alone), or it {{can be used as a}} precursor to form liquid fuels, such as dimethyl ether or Fischer Tropsh diesel. There is drawback to BLG, which has the potential to become a third major incentive if this work is successful. The causticizing load is greater for gasification of black liquor than for combustion in a Tomlinson boiler. So implementing BLG in an existing mill would require costly increases to the causticizing capacity. In situ causticizing [within the gasifier] would handle the entire causticizing load and therefore eliminate the lime cycle entirely. Previous work by the author and others has shown that titanate direct causticizing (i. e. in situ) works quite well for high-temperature BLG (950 °C), but was limited to pressures below about 5 bar. It is desirable however to operate BLG at 20 - 30 bar for efficiency reasons related to either firing the syngas in a turbine, or catalytically forming liquid fuels. This work focused on achieving high direct causticizing yields at 20 bars pressure. The titanate direct causticizing reactions are inhibited by CO 2. Previous work has shown that the partial pressure of CO 2 should be kept below about 0. 5 bar in order for the process to work. This translates to a total reactor pressure limit of about 5 bar for airblown BLG, and only 2 bar for O 2 -blown BLG. In this work a process was developed in which the CO 2 partial pressure could be manipulated to a level under 0. 5 bar with the total system pressure at 10 bar during O 2 -blown BLG. This fell short of our 20 bar goal but still represents a substantial increase in the pressure limit. A material and energy balance was performed, as well as first-pass economics based on capital and utilities costs. Compared to a reference case of using BLG with a conventional lime cycle [Larson, 2003], the IRR and NVP were estimated for further replacing the lime kiln with direct causticizing. The economics are strongly dependent on the price of lime kiln fuel. At $ 6 /mmBTU the lime cycle is the clear choice. At $ 8 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 10 M with IRR of 17 %. At $ 12 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 45 M with IRR of 36 %. To further increase the total allowable pressure, the CO 2 could be further decreased by further decreasing the temperature. Testing should be done at 750 C. Also a small pilot should be built...|$|R

Two evaporation effects for CTMP-effluent are integrated with the black liquor evaporation plant. Until now all of the CTMP-effluent was released to recipient after sedimentation and treatment in an aerated lagoon. Skoghall plans to evaporate {{one third of the}} total CTMP-effluent in order to decrease their pollution of oxygen demanding substances etc. Evaporation is a new method for treatment of CTMP-effluent and is only implemented at a few mills nowadays. These mills have experienced problems with scaling resulting in a low availability. Scales from CTMP-evaporation differs from scales formed during black liquor evaporation being more organic. They are mainly composed of extractives (resin) and fragments of fibers. The purpose of this thesis was to find operating conditions and, if necessary, find new solutions to obtain a high availability for the CTMP-evaporation at Skoghall. In the study, evaporation experiments were carried out in a new pilot evaporator. Two cases were compared, one with untreated CTMP-effluent and one with CTMP-effluent by adding <b>white</b> and green <b>liquor.</b> Previous studies have shown that alkalinisation decreases the scaling tendency. An important part of the experiments was to find washing procedures enabling scale removing. The results are based on measurement data, liquor and scale analyses and observations during evaporation and washing. In a comparison between the two cases the alkalinised CTMP-effluent formed less scales. Scales from the alkalinized experiment where dark, hard and brittle and consisted mainly of calcium carbonate. The scales from the untreated experiment where slightly yellow, soft and sticky and consisted mainly of resin. After the experiment with alkalinised CTMP-effluent, acid washing was performed with satisfying results. Washing with dispersing agent, after the untreated experiment, showed an excellent result even though the amount of scales where larger. Dispersing agents are normally used as additives in pulp mills to prevent resin scales. Adding dispersing agent continuously to untreated CTMP-effluent, before evaporation, is probably a better pre-treatment t hen alkalinisation in order to prevent scales...|$|R
