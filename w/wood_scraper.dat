5000|$|A <b>wood</b> <b>scraper</b> block, {{also known}} as wooden agogo or tone wood block, is an idiophone {{percussion}} instrument. It consists, usually, {{in a pair of}} small tubes made of wood, each one of different size, producing different tones. These tubes are played with a stick and have a ribbed surface to double as scraper. Originally proposed by Matin Cohen from Latin Percussion, imitating a Brazilian agogô and Latin güiro, this instrument is also manufacturated with a single block or with three blocks.|$|E

60|$|It {{was quite}} {{literally}} his hand, indeed, {{that he tried}} at first; for the earliest decoration upon paleolithic pottery is made by pressing the fingers into the clay so as to produce a couple of deep parallel furrows, which is the sole attempt at ornament on M. Joly's Nabrigas specimen; while the urns and drinking-cups taken from our English long barrows are adorned with really pretty and effective patterns, produced by pressing {{the tip of the}} finger and the nail into the plastic material. It is wonderful what capital and varied results you can get with no more recondite graver than the human finger-nail, sometimes turned front downward, sometimes back downward, and sometimes used to egg up the moist clay into small jagged and relieved designs. Most of these patterns are more or less plaitlike in arrangement, evidently suggested to the mind of the potter by the primitive marks of the old basketwork. But, as time went on, the early artist learned to press into his service new implements, pieces of <b>wood,</b> bone <b>scrapers,</b> and the flint knife itself, with which he incised more regular patterns, straight or zigzag lines, rows of dots, squares and triangles, concentric circles, and even the mystic cross and swastika, the sacred symbols of yet unborn and undreamt-of religions. As yet, there was no direct imitation of plant or animal forms; once only, on a single specimen from a Swiss lake dwelling, are the stem and veins of a leaf dimly figured on the handiwork of the European prehistoric potter. Ornament in its pure form, as pattern merely, had begun to exist; imitative work as such was yet unknown, or almost unknown, to the eastern hemisphere.|$|R
