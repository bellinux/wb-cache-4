40|$|The {{production}} requirements of original graphic {{works of art}} have changed since 1980. The development of digital printing using lightfast colors now rivals traditional techniques such as wood cut, screen print, lithography, etching etc. Today, with respect to artistic legitimacy, original graphics using traditional <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> compete with original graphics produced by digital <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> on the art market. What criteria distinguish traditional <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> from those of digital printing in the production and acquisition of original graphics? What consequences is the serious artist faced with when deciding to implement digital print production? How does digital print change original graphic acquisition decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of the printing trade requires an attentive observation of how different <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> have shaped the trade since the Nineteenth century.
