25|$|Blignaut <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> subdued for the 33 {{deliveries}} he faced, {{and although}} he did attempt some ODI-style heaves, they mostly missed both his bat and the off stump. Blignaut was eventually lbw for 4, but Keith Dabengwa {{came to the rescue}} with an entertaining 35 to bat out the day. He yielded a catch to VVS Laxman at first slip off Irfan Pathan in the second over of the morning, however, as Zimbabwe only managed to add ten to their overnight score for the loss of three wickets. Pathan was the pick of the Indian bowlers, swinging the ball well to dismiss Gavin Ewing and Blessing Mahwire as well, as Zimbabwe were all out for 279 – with Tatenda Taibu left not out for 71.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Simpson, William Dietrich and John David Anglin {{discovered}} that some impulsive sun flares produce energetic particles among which Helium-3, a light non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron, {{is at least}} ten times more abundant than Helium-4, a non-radioactive and light isotope of helium. On Earth, Helium-4 is what makes up about 99.986% of the helium here. In 1973 his instruments on Pioneer 10 and 11 indicated a cosmic ray intensity increase of about 1 percent per AU. In 1975 he found that during the low point of activity three years prior, the abundance of cosmic ray helium <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> enhanced at these very low energies, as opposed to it dropping off with declining energies like the protons do, toward zero energy.|$|E
500|$|From the {{physical}} {{layout of the}} club, as described by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column, the Stork should have been doomed to failure, since it <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> shaped and far from roomy in places. The club's ladies' room was {{on the second floor}} of the structure and the men's room was on the third; only the dining room, bar, and later the Cub Room were on the first floor. Despite this, the club could hold 1,000 guests. A feature of the club was a solid 14-karat gold chain at its entrance; patrons were allowed entry through it by the doorman. When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park, one of the artifacts found in it was a still. [...] The New York Historical Society displayed that along with other Stork Club items and memorabilia in an exhibit in 2000.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} a view that the free {{improvisation}} music space was largely the domain of male heterosexuals, and that women were marginalized. Canadian academic Julie Dawn Smith wrote in her 2004 essay, [...] "Playing Like a Girl: The Queer Laughter of the Feminist Improvising Group", that [...] "The opportunity for freedom in relation to sexual difference, gender, and sexuality for women improvisers <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> absent from the discourses and practices of free jazz and free improvisation". When the Feminist Improvising Group appeared in 1977, they challenged the established male-dominated musical improvising community. FIG were a mixture of white, black, lesbian, straight, working- and middle-class women. Maggie Nicols wanted the group {{to be open to}} all women of different backgrounds and different levels of musicianship, even those who had not improvised before. She saw these differing abilities, which gave rise to unexpected results, as a strength and not a weakness. According to critic Dana Reason Myers, [...] "The result was a music that had to be taken on its own terms, as music that decidedly and consciously included the politics of being women, musicians, improvisers, and members of a society." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of the University of Bristol's {{buildings}} date to its pre-charter {{days when}} it was University College Bristol. These buildings were designed by Charles Hansom, the younger brother of Joseph Hansom, Joseph being {{the inventor of the}} Hansom Cab. These buildings suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. George Oatley added to them a tower in memory of Albert Fry which can still be seen on University Road. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building which it was hoped would be a symbol of academic permanence for the university and a memorial to the chief benefactor of the university, Henry Overton Wills. It was requested to the architect George Oatley that the building be built to last at least 400 years but the site purchased, at the top of Park Street suffered from an awkward slope and a desirability to link the building with the Museum and Art Gallery situated adjacent to the plot. The architecture critic Roger Gill has stated that the building is [...] "remarkable in size" [...] but noted that the [...] "ambience of a medieval University <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> lacking". He goes on to criticise the building as a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "folly". The armorials on the Founder's Window represent all of the interests present at the founding of the University of Bristol including the Wills and Fry families. The Tyndalls Park Estate and Royal Fort House were also purchased from the trustees of the Tyndall family allowing the university to expand. Many Departments in the Faculty of Arts are housed in large Victorian houses which have been converted for teaching.|$|E

[...] Indeed, his omission {{is one of the}} main reasons why many historians regard Nyren as unreliable. [...] The statistical record and contemporary reports both show that Veck was one of the outstanding batsmen of his time.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC showed {{video footage}} from a Hong Kong TV network which {{appeared}} to show 'anti-Occupy protesters' being hired and transported to an Occupy protest site. The 'protesters', {{many of whom were}} initially unaware of what they were being paid to do, were secretly filmed on the bus being handed money by the organiser. Anonymous police sources informed the BBC Newsnight investigation that [...] "back-up <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> unforthcoming" [...] to scenes of violence. The South China Morning Post also reported claims that people from poor districts were being offered up to HK$800 per day, via WhatsApp messaging, to participate in anti-Occupy riots.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} Pichegru <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> inert. Because of his stature, he {{prevented}} more active men like Willot from carrying out plans {{to defend against}} the Triumvirate. The Coup of 18 Fructidor occurred on 4 September 1797 as soldiers under Augereau and Lemoine occupied key positions in Paris. Pichegru and Willot spent the morning in the Tuileries Palace. The troops {{that were supposed to}} defend the elected assemblies joined the coup or melted away. Pichegru, Willot and Barthélemy were arrested but Carnot managed to escape abroad. They and 51 others were sentenced to be transported to Sinnamary (Cayenne) where it was expected that the so-called [...] "dry guillotine" [...] of tropical diseases would soon kill them. The carriages that took the prisoners to the seaports were fitted with iron bars so none could escape.|$|E
2500|$|England {{took four}} fast bowlers; Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Peter Loader, which Swanton thought was one too many, and the all-rounders Trevor Bailey and Ted Dexter. Tyson {{had been the}} decisive force in England's 3-1 victory on the {{previous}} tour, but had been dogged by a heel injury since 1955 and had played only intermittently for England ever since. Though still capable of blazing his way through many First Class cricket teams, Tyson struggled on the slow, plumb wickets used in the Tests. The outspoken Yorkshireman Fred Trueman called himself [...] "The Best Bloody English Fast Bowler That Ever Drew Bloody Breath" [...] and with considerable justification. He possessed a text-book side-on action which generated great pace and menacing late swing which was coupled with the fitness and stamina to bowl a [...] On this tour he <b>was</b> <b>strangely</b> subdued, he was overbowled {{at the start of}} the injury-struck tour and took just 9 wickets (30.66) in the last three Tests, but took 28 wickets (19.54) in his other matches. Brian Statham was the [...] "straight man" [...] of the England fast bowling attack, running up the hill and into the wind while Tyson and Trueman let rip from the other end. He maintained a nagging line and length, but [...] "George" [...] was regarded as an unlucky bowler, so many times did he beat the batsman only to see the ball miss the stumps by the thinnest of margins. He lived by two mottos, the first [...] "bowling in matches keeps me fit for bowling" [...] preferring a quiet cigarette to physical training or net practise. The second was [...] "if they miss, I hit", never more aptly demonstrated than in the match against [...] when he took 7/47 - six bowled and one l.b.w.. He was one of the few England players to have a successful tour with 12 wickets (23.83) despite missing the Fifth Test along with Peter Loader due to a car crash. Loader had been in and out of the England team and had toured Australia in 1954-55 without playing in any of the Tests. A fast-medium swing bowler with a wide range of pace and a nasty bouncer he took the first post war Test hat-trick in his 6/36 against the West Indies at [...] in 1957. He bowled consistently well and took 26 wickets (19.50) on the tour, but only 7 wickets (27.57) in what was to be his last Test series. Along with Tyson, Laker and Loader Trevor Bailey was on his final tour, but did not improve his reputation. A fast-medium swing bowler whose grudging accuracy mirrored his famously negative batting he could be very dangerous in the right conditions, taking [...] in 1953-54 and [...] in 1957 against the West Indies, but was mostly used for containment and failed on the tour. Ted Dexter was a late reinforcement and a capable swing bowler, but did not bowl in the Tests.|$|E
