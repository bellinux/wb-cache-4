5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected {{to level the playing field}} in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E

The AA offered to make no demands or set any preconditions; the union merely asked that Carnegie Steel reopen the negotiations. Reid wrote to Frick, warning him that the strike <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> the Republican ticket and pleading with him to reopen talks. Frick refused.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Ron Page left, and {{the group}} hired Gary McSpadden (who had filled in for Jake Hess in the Statesmen Quartet) as {{baritone}} with the understanding from Jake Hess {{that when he was}} ready to start a group, he would recruit McSpadden. They recorded another album on Skylite, and then two groundbreaking albums on Warner Brothers. When Hess followed through on that promise, McSpadden quit to join a new group Hess was forming, the Imperials. Jim Hammill (who later became a mainstay in the Kingsmen Quartet) was chosen to be his replacement. They made one album for Festival Records, one for Stateswood (Skylite's budget label), and two more for Skylite. Hammill did not get {{along with the rest of}} the group, and a fan named William Lee Golden felt that Hammill <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> the group and asked the group if he could be Hammil's replacement. After Hammil's retirement from the group in 1964, Golden joined as baritone.|$|E

500|$|One of {{her first}} {{activities}} with the ILP found Pankhurst distributing food to poor men and women through the Committee for the Relief of the Unemployed. In December 1894 she {{was elected to the}} position of Poor Law Guardian in Chorlton-on-Medlock. She was appalled by the conditions she witnessed first-hand in the Manchester workhouse:Pankhurst immediately began to change these conditions, and established herself as a successful voice of reform on the Board of Guardians. Her chief opponent was a passionate man named Mainwaring, known for his rudeness. Recognising that his loud anger <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> his chances of persuading those aligned with Pankhurst, he kept a note nearby during meetings: [...] "Keep your temper!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

500|$|On December19, 1989, the Court of Appeals {{announced}} their {{decision on the}} case of Village of Westbury v. Department of Transportation of the State of New York, et al., ruling in favor of Westbury. In its decision, the court stated NYSDOT should have issued a joint report for the interchange and widening projects because both projects improved the flow of traffic on the Northern State Parkway and thus were related. The ruling made by the previous court was affirmed, and NYSDOT was advised to consider the environmental impacts of projects on other nearby projects in the future. While the village of Westbury was praising Ernest Strada for taking on the state, residents of the village of Carle Place felt they were being taken hostage by his actions and that the stoppage of work <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> their community more than Westbury. Editorials in Newsday also called the mayor [...] "parochial and overzealous".|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 18 February, Fasial al-Hamar, then the Minister of Health, issued a press release aired on the {{national}} TV which denied there had been any deaths. He said the situation at Salmaniya hospital was calm and that only seven people were being treated for minor injuries. He also warned against what he called [...] "rumors" [...] spread in some satellite channels and websites. Bahrain's ambassador to the United States said that if army forces did fire live ammunition, [...] "Probably they were warning shots only". [...] "The forces that were used were proportional according to the law, they were legal, they were necessary because they were stopping the shops. The economy <b>was</b> <b>hurting,</b> the national economy. We had to take action and action {{was taken by the}} law," [...] he added. However he admitted protesters did not use live rounds and promised that [...] "Investigations will happen. And they will continue".|$|E
500|$|Greenbacks, {{which were}} backed by neither silver nor gold {{but by the}} credit of the United States, and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures, had helped to finance the war. In the late 1860s, {{politicians}} disagreed about how quickly to have the government resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations. Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch felt {{the best way to}} return to that practice was to withdraw the greenbacks as quickly as possible, and he did so until stopped by Congress, which felt his contractionist stand <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> the economy. [...] More and more silver was being mined in the Far West. [...] Falls in the price of the metal made the option of depositing silver at the Mint in exchange for coin more attractive, and mintages of the silver dollar rose considerably in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. [...] The silver dollar was fully legal tender, and some officials worried that the increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by Gresham's Law, endangering the gold standard.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as using}} {{existing}} music, {{such as the}} themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed {{a piece of music}} for Rose's farewell entitled [...] "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{averaged}} 18.6 {{points on}} 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds {{in his first}} year of varsity basketball. He still played a somewhat unaggressive or [...] "soft" [...] brand of basketball, and it <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> his chances of being drafted by a professional team. Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the University of Nebraska who was studying as an undergrad at American. Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be [...] "cool" [...] on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks. Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an NCAA-leading 19.8 rebounds in his junior season. He was drafted after his junior season by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him. He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school. He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 Olympic basketball team after the season, but did not make the squad.|$|E
500|$|Criticism has befallen Sega's {{management}} regarding {{both the}} creation and handling of the Saturn. McFerran criticizes Sega's management {{at the time of}} the Saturn's development, claiming that it had [...] "fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry". Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to end support for the Saturn. According to Fahs, [...] "Stolar's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar's redemption." [...] Stolar has defended his decision, stating, [...] "I felt Saturn <b>was</b> <b>hurting</b> the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren't going to win." [...] Sheffield stated that the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals undermined third-party support for the system, but because [...] "nVidia invested in quads" [...] at the same time there is [...] "a remote possibility" [...] they could have [...] "become the standard instead of triangles"—"if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era." [...] Speaking more positively of the system, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as [...] "the start of the future of console gaming" [...] because it [...] "got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time". Writing for GamesRadar, Justin Towell noted that the Saturn's 3D Pad [...] "set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog shoulder triggers and left thumbstick...
