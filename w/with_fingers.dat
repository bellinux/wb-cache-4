40|$|The {{symptoms}} of carpal tunnel syndrome, a compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist, are aggravated by wrist motion, {{but the effect}} of these motions on median nerve motion are unknown. To better understand the biomechanics of the abnormal nerve, it is first necessary to understand normal nerve movement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the deformation and displacement of the normal median nerve at the proximal carpal tunnel level on transverse ultrasound images during different wrist movements, to have a baseline for comparison with abnormal movements. Dynamic ultrasound images of both wrists of 10 asymptomatic volunteers were obtained during wrist maximal flexion, extension and ulnar deviation. To simplify the analysis, the initial and final shape and position of the median nerve were measured and analyzed. The circularity of the median nerve was significantly increased and the aspect ratio and perimeter were significantly decreased in the final image compared with the first image during wrist flexion <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension, wrist flexion <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> flexion and wrist ulnar deviation <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension (p< 0. 01). There were significant differences in median nerve displacement vector between finger flexion, wrist flexion <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension and wrist ulnar deviation <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension (all p's< 0. 001). The mean amplitudes of median nerve motion in wrist flexion <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension (2. 36 ± 0. 79 normalized units [NU]), wrist flexion <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> flexion (2. 46 ± 0. 84 NU) and wrist ulnar deviation <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension (2. 86 ± 0. 51 NU) were higher than those in finger flexion (0. 82 ± 0. 33 NU), wrist extension <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> extension (0. 77 ± 0. 46 NU) and wrist extension <b>with</b> <b>finger</b> flexion (0. 81 ± 0. 58 NU) (p< 0. 0001). In the normal carpal tunnel, wrist flexion and ulnar deviation could induce significant transverse displacement and deformation of the median nerve...|$|R

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).

Anecdotally, it is a substantial number.

25|$|Electronic drum pads are {{the second}} most widely used type of MIDI {{performance}} controllers, after electronic music keyboards. Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, they may be standalone control surfaces (e.g., rubber drum pads), or they may emulate {{the look and feel}} of acoustic percussion instruments. The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, and they are usually played <b>with</b> <b>fingers.</b> Dedicated drum pads such as the Roland Octapad or the DrumKAT are playable with the hands or with sticks, and are often built to resemble the general form of a drum kit. There are also percussion controllers such as the vibraphone-style MalletKAT, and Don Buchla's Marimba Lumina.|$|E
25|$|Devices {{have been}} used to aid {{computation}} for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence <b>with</b> <b>fingers.</b> The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use of counting rods is one example. The abacus was early used for arithmetic tasks. What we now call the Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as c. 2700–2300 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.|$|E

25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape <b>with</b> <b>fingers,</b> palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style.

And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played <b>with</b> <b>fingers</b> or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} in fielding {{in the two}} sports {{is that even though}} a cricket ball is harder and heavier than a baseball, the fielders in cricket are more restricted in the use of protection for the hands. The only fielders who can wear protective gear are the wicket-keeper, who is allowed to wear padded gloves as well as leg guards and a box; and fielders in potentially dangerous close-in positions such as silly point and short leg, who may wear shinpads, boxes and helmets but are not allowed any gloves. In baseball, catchers and first basemen normally wear mitts, which have no fingers and are specially designed for each respective position. The other fielders wear gloves <b>with</b> <b>fingers.</b> (Early baseball was also played bare-handed; gloves were adopted in the later 19th century.) This means that the risk of hand injury due to the impact of the ball is far higher in cricket. Also, especially in Test cricket, it is common for several fielders to be stationed close to the bat (slips, short leg, silly point and similar positions) since the likelihood and value of dismissing a batsman by a catch in a close fielding position is higher. Catching at these positions require exceptional reflexes, skill and courage, associated with bare-handed catching of a hard ball travelling at up to , with reaction times of the order of 0.2 seconds.|$|E
