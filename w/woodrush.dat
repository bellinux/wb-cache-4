With an {{elevation}} that varies from 4,000 to 8,200 feet (1220 to 2500 m), {{it is an}} intermediate zone between the Southern Cascades and the Subalpine/Alpine zone. Cryic soils support mixed coniferous forests dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and Pacific silver fir; they are colder than the mesic and frigid soils of the Southern Cascades. Grand fir, white fir, and Shasta red fir also occur and become more common toward the south and east. Whitebark pine is found at high elevations. Understory plants include <b>woodrush,</b> Prince’s pine, lupine, and sidebells shinleaf. At the highest elevations, open meadows support Shasta buckwheat, Newberry knotweed, and Brewer's sedge. The region tends to be drier than the Cascade Crest Montane Forest, with a longer summer drought and more intermittent streams. The region covers [...] in Southern Oregon and includes the lower elevations of Crater Lake National Park.|$|E
2500|$|CURV-III {{became known}} in the Great Lakes region in 1976 when {{it was used to}} survey the wreck of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. [...] Its mother ship was USCGC <b>Woodrush</b> and {{logistics}} support was provided by USCG Point Steel. CURV-III logged twelve dives in [...] of water with more than 56 hours of bottom time. [...] The dives produced 43,000 feet of videotape and 895 still photographs. [...] The CURV-III underwater survey confirmed that the Fitzgerald was well beyond normal commercial salvage. [...] Observers of the survey concluded that there was more damage to the Fitzgerald than expected but were unable to determine the cause of its foundering. Although operators of CURV-III were fully prepared to recover bodies during the survey, they did not locate any of the 29-man crew. [...] An independent researcher was contracted to review the survey results and produce the sketches of the wreck used in the United States Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board investigation reports.|$|E
