500|$|Nude per l'assassino {{has been}} met with mixed to {{negative}} reviews. Writing for AllMovie, Jason Buchanan rated the film two stars out of five, calling it [...] "unabashedly sadistic". Budd Wilkins, writing for Slant magazine, rated the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "one {{of the more}} sordid examples" [...] of the giallo genre. Wilkins noted that the film's violence [...] "isn't necessarily stronger than in contemporary giallo films like Argento's Deep Red", {{but that it is}} [...] "more resolutely tied to aberrant sexuality than almost anywhere else in the genre". Wilkins also compared the film's central premise—that of revenge for a failed abortion—to that of Massimo Dallamano's 1972 film <b>What</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> to Solange?. DVD Talk's Adam Tyner also gave the film two stars out of five, summarising it as [...] "not much of a movie".

We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. He came back and said, “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, <b>what</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>done?</b> Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present your wish). After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. Then I told Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!) Everybody was dumbfounded...|$|E
