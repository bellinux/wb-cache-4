Objective surface models are obtainable from the accumulation of each structure’s serial outlines, followed by surface reconstruction. The segmented images including the outlines {{can be divided into}} outlined images, white-fi lled images, and color-fi lled images. Th e {{purpose of this study was}} to report the benefi ts of the three types of segmented images for surface reconstruction. For the raw data, sectioned images of a male cadaver head were used. In the sectioned images, 91 structures were delineated for the preparation of 234 serial outlined images. Th e outlined images were converted into white-fi lled and color-fi lled images; the reverse conversion was also possible. Th e outlined images, including the original sectioned images, could be the source not only of surface models but also of volume models. Th e white-fi lled images, with a minimal fi le size, were preferred for separate surface reconstruction of the individual structures. Th e color-fi lled images, which allowed for recognition of the entire outlined structures simultaneously, were regarded as a good choice for the construction of several surface models. For the process, we employed a variety of soft <b>ware</b> <b>packages</b> including those for animation, where the images were compatible.

The objcctives {{of this study were}} to analyze the effect of packaging material and low temperature storage on the quality changes of fresh red curly chili and to determine the optimum combination of packaging material and temperature storage. After being harvested, samples of red curly chili were sorted and packed in differents packaging material of 3 kg and transported to the laboratory within 5 hours at ambient temperature condition. During storage period, the visual appearance, change in respiration rate, weight loss, firmness and color were measured. Waring, plastic sack and polipropilene plastic were selected as packaging materials, temperature of 10, 15 OC and ambient temperature were set as storage temperature. The results show that packaging material and temperature storage influenced the respiration rate, weight loss and firmness of red curly chili. Lightness (L*) correlated only with packaging material. The interaction between packaging material and temperature storage has only correlation with weight loss. The highest losses of 21. 06 ± 0. 4 was resulted for the combination of <b>waring</b> <b>packaging</b> at room temperature. The lowest losses of 0. 12 %± 0. 1 was found for the combination of polipropoline plastic packaging at 10 OC.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 This M. S thesis {{presents}} an interactive software tool that I have {{developed in the}} course of the past two years. This interactive tool is called AISO. AISO is aimed at interactive image segmentation and annotation tool designed to allow users to segment an image – such as those produced with digital photography or from scanned prints – and then annotate those segments with ontology terms. Many photo-editing and illustration soft- <b>ware</b> <b>packages</b> enable the ad-hoc editing of an image, but any highlighting and labeling utility requires thorough knowledge of the softwares illustration capabilities (i. e. lay- ering, boundary detection) and does not include the structured integration of scientific data. For example, any labels applied to hand-illustrated segments super-imposed onto an image would have to be individually constructed and associated with a particular portion of an image. AISO simplifies this functionality and requires only a few input gestures and clicks to identify and label segments. The resulting structured image and ontology data allows for consistent extraction techniques. Researchers are thus empow- ered to construct meaningful image data sets drawn from their laboratories, online image archives, and publications. For this thesis I evaluated AISO by soliciting feedback from a selected group of biological researchers. They provided overall positive feedback on user friendliness, consistency and predictability of AISO, speed of interaction of AISO. As the key contribution, this thesis provides the first open source software for plant biologists by integrating the state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms with plant ontology webservice. Based on our preliminary user study, AISO has potential to significantly advance current practices in plant biology research...|$|R

40|$|Creating {{controlled}} dynamic character animation {{consists of}} mathe- matical modelling of muscles and solving the activation dynamics {{that form the}} key to coordination. But biomechanical simulation and control is com- putationally expensive involving complex di erential equations and is not suitable for real-time platforms like games. Performing such computations at every time-step reduces frame rate. Modern games use generic soft- <b>ware</b> <b>packages</b> called physics engines to perform {{a wide variety of}} in-game physical e ects. The physics engines are optimized for gaming platforms. Therefore, a physics engine compatible model of anatomical muscles and an alternative control architecture is essential to create biomechanical charac- ters in games. This thesis presents a system that generates muscle activations from captured motion by borrowing principles from biomechanics and neural con- trol. A generic physics engine compliant muscle model primitive is also de- veloped. The muscle model primitive forms the motion actuator and {{is an integral part of}} the physical model used in the simulation. This thesis investigates a stochastic solution to create a controller that mimics the neural control system employed in the human body. The control system uses evolutionary neural networks that evolve its weights using genetic algorithms. Examples and guidance often act as templates in muscle training during all stages of human life. Similarly, the neural con- troller attempts to learn muscle coordination through input motion samples. The thesis also explores the objective functions developed that aids in the genetic evolution of the neural network. Character interaction with the game world is still a pre-animated behaviour in most current games. Physically-based procedural hand ani- mation is a step towards autonomous interaction of game characters with the game world. The neural controller and the muscle primitive developed are used to animate a dynamic model of a human hand within a real-time physics engine environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether relative contributions of genetic and shared environmental factors {{are associated with}} an increased risk in melanoma. Data from the Queensland Familial Melanoma Project comprising 15, 907 subjects arising from 1912 families were analyzed to estimate the additive genetic, common and unique environmental contributions to variation in the age at onset of melanoma. Two complementary approaches for analyzing correlated time-to-onset family data were considered: the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method in which one can estimate relationship-specific dependence simultaneously with regression coefficients that describe the average population response to changing covariates; and a subject-specific Bayesian mixed model in which heterogeneity in regression parameters is explicitly modeled and the different components of variation may be estimated directly. The proportional hazards and Weibull models were utilized, as both produce natural frameworks for estimating relative risks while adjusting for simultaneous effects of other covariates. A simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for covariate imputation of missing data was used and the actual implementation of the Bayesian model was based on Gibbs sampling using the free <b>ware</b> <b>package</b> BUGS. In addition, we also used a Bayesian model to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on the expression of naevi and freckles, which are known risk factors for melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Context: Pain is {{subjective}} and labor pain perception {{is said to}} be influenced by personality, culture, parity, educational status and maternal weight. Objectives: This study assessed the Igbo Women′s perception of labor pain and evaluated factors influencing their perception of labor pain as well as ascertained the level of utilization of obstetric analgesia by parturients. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that spanned 6 months (January 1, to June 30, 2011) and involved parturients of Igbo extraction who delivered by vaginal route in 3 different referral hospitals. They were interviewed with self-administered questionnaires within the first 24 - 48 hours postpartum. Labor pains were rated using a 3 -pont verbal rating scale (VRS). Data were analysed with MathCAD 7 statistical soft <b>ware</b> <b>package.</b> Results: A total of 530 parturients were interviewed but only 500 were analysed. Fifty-two percent of parturients rated labor pain as severe. While 67. 6 % of parturients desired labor pain alleviation, only 38 % actually requested for analgesia, and only 27 % of parturients received pain relief during labor. The commonest pain relief available was intramuscular injection of Pentazocine Hydrochloride (92. 6 %) The influence of age, parity, educational status, maternal weight and companionship, on pain perception was statistically significant. Conclusion: Though most Igbo women found labor painful, they tend to cope with it. Most Igbo parturients did not request for pain relief and only a fraction of those who did request received it.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{therapeutic}} effect of the PUMA gene mediated by ra- diation-inducible promoters in the treatment of ton- gue squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: Recombi- nant pcDNA 3. 1 (+) /E-PUMA was constructed, in which the PUMA gene was mediated by a synthetic radiation inducible promoter. The recombined plas-mids were transfected into the Tca 8113 cell and xeno- grafts of human tongue squamous carcinoma in na- ked mice respectively. After 24 h, the tumors were tr- eated with 3 Gy of irradiation to upregulate the PU- MA gene expression. PUMA mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and apoptosis were detected by immunohistochemi- cal method and in situ end-labeling (ISEL) respecti- vely. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 11. 0 soft- <b>ware</b> <b>package</b> for chi-square test. RESULTS: Com-pared with the control group, the comparative survi- val rate of Tca 8113 cells in the PUMA/IR group was markedly decreased and the xenografts were signify- cantly suppressed. Up-regulation of PUMA gene ex- pression was observed in the Tca 8113 cells and in the xenografts after irradiation. The apoptosis indices of the Tca 8113 cells and xenograft with irradiation were markedly higher than those without irradiation. At the same time, the proliferation indices of the Tca- 8113 cells and xenografts with irradiation were mark- edly lower than those without irradiation. Conclu- sions: radiation-induc ible promoters can serve as molecular switches to improve the expression of PU- MA gene in tongue squamous cell carcinoma both in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the higher}} risk victimization {{of young women}} in Ethiopia, the {{prevalence}} of sexual violence and its determinants among college students were scarce, particularly in the study area. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and associated factors of sexual violence among female private college students in Bahir Dar city. Methods: A cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} April 2012 among 541 female college students in Bahir Dar city using multistage sampling technique. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed in bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with SPSS version 16 soft <b>ware</b> <b>package.</b> Result: The study revealed that the prevalence of sexual violence among female college students was 37. 3 %. Respondents whose childhood background from rural areas were more than four times likely to have had sexual violence (AOR = 4. 51, 95 %CI: 1. 67 - 12. 16). The odds of sexual violence were higher for those respondents who had a close friend who drank alcohol (AOR = 3. 13, 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 8. 97). Besides, respondents who had never discussed on reproductive health issues with their parents were more than four times likely to have had sexual violence (AOR = 4. 36, 95 %CI: 1. 40 - 13. 56). Conclusion: This study shows that sexual violence among female college students is higher. Sexual violence is associated with certain variables such as rural childhood residence, having a close friend who drank alcohol, and not discussing reproductive issues with parents. Therefore, it is recommend ed that sexual violence needs due attention and remedial action from policy makers, college officials, parents, students and other concerned bodies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} human-like structure, {{humanoid}} robots {{are capable of}} doing some complex tasks. Since a humanoid robot has a large number of actuators and sensors, controlling it is a difficult task. For various tasks like balancing, driving a car, and interacting with humans, real-time response of the robot is essential. Efficiently controlling a humanoid robot requires a software that guarantees real-time interface and control mechanism so that real-time response of the robot is possible. Addition- ally, to reduce the development effort and time, the software should be open-source, multi-lingual and should have high-level constructs inbuilt in it. ^ Currently Robot Operating System (ROS) and Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio (MRDS) are most commonly used software packages for controlling robots. Since ROS uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for inter-process communication, the latency in communication is high. Therefore, if ROS is used, the robot cannot respond in real-time. On the other hand, MRDS is not an open-source but a proprietary soft- <b>ware</b> <b>package.</b> Therefore it cannot be optimized for a particular robot. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a real-time, open-source, modular, and thin software for controlling humanoid robots. This thesis describes the design and architecture of two software packages developed to fill this gap. ^ It is expected that in the near future a large number of humanoid robots will be used all around the world. The humanoid robots will be used to perform various tasks. The developed software packages have the potential to be the most commonly used software packages for controlling humanoid robots. These packages will assist humans in controlling and monitoring humanoid robots to perform search-and-rescue operations, explore the universe, assist in household chores, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet {{brushless}} DC motors (PMBLDC) find wide {{applications in}} industries {{due to their}} high power density and ease of control. These motors are generally controlled using a three phase power semiconductor bridge. For starting and the providing proper commutation sequence {{to turn on the}} power devices in the inverter bridge the rotor position sensors required. Based on the rotor position, the power devices are commutated sequentially every 60 degrees. To achieve desired level of performance the motor requires suitable speed controllers. In case of permanent magnet motors, usually speed control is achieved by using proportional-integral(PI) controller. Although conventional PI controllers are widely used in the industry due to their simple control structure and ease of implementation, these controllers pose difficulties where there are some control complexity such as nonlinearity, load disturbances and parametric variations. Moreover PI controllers require precise linear mathematical models. This thesis presents a Fuzzy Logic Controller(FLC) for speed control of a BLDC by using. The Fuzzy Logic(FL) approach applied to speed control leads to an improved dynamic behavior of the motor drive system and an immune to load perturbations and parameter variations. The FLC is designed using based on a simple analogy between the control surfaces of the FLC and a given Proportional-Integral controller(PIC) for the same application. Fuzzy logic control offers an improvement in the quality of the speed response, compared to PI control. This work focuses on investigation and evaluation of the performance of a permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDC) drive, controlled by PI, and Fuzzy logic speed controllers.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{widespread}} use of dexamethasone in veterinary and human medicine, it is reported to cause some severe pregnancy related side effects like abortion in some animals. The mechanism of the response is not clear but seems to be related to interspecies and/or breed difference in response which may involve alterations in the concentrations of some reproductive hormones. Methods Twenty Sahel goats comprising 18 does and 2 bucks were used for this study. Pregnancies were achieved by natural mating after synchronization. Repeated dexamethasone injections were given at 0. 25  mg/kg body weight. Blood samples were collected biweekly for hormonal assay. Uterine biopsies were harvested at days 28 and day 78 of gestation through caesarean section for immunohistochemical analysis using 3 pregnant does randomly selected from each group at each instant. Data were expressed as Means ± Standard Deviations and analyzed using statistical soft <b>ware</b> <b>package,</b> GraphPad Instant, version 3. 0 (2003) and progesterone receptor (PR) were scored semi-quantitatively. Results Dexamethasone treatments had no significant (p >  0. 05) effect on progesterone and estrogen concentrations in pregnant Sahel goats but up regulated PR from 2 + to 3 + in second trimester. Conclusion As dexamethasone adverse effect on placenta is an established fact, the lack of effect on progesterone level in this study {{may be due to the}} fact that unlike other species whose progesterone production during pregnancy is placenta – dependent, in goats is corpus luteum - dependent. Consequently dexamethasone adverse effect on placenta reported in literatures did not influence progesterone levels during pregnancy in Sahel goat. The up regulation of progesterone receptor (PR) in Sahel goat gravid uterus is a beneficial effects and that dexamethasone can safely be used in corpus luteum – dependent progesterone secreting pregnant animal species like Sahel goat and camel. Therefore source of progesterone secretions during pregnancy should be considered in clinical application of dexamethasone in pregnancy...|$|E
