500|$|Set {{during the}} writing of On the Origin of Species, the movie depicts Darwin's {{struggle}} with {{the subject of the}} book as well as with his wife, who opposed his theories, and their mourning for their daughter Annie. The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Darwin's wife, a religious woman who disapproved of her husband's theories, is played by Jennifer Connelly, Bettany's real-life wife, in the kind of casting that doesn't always work, but it does here. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Darwins' history together, their familiarity and affection. Connelly's English accent is also as good as Renée Zellweger's and Gwyneth Paltrow's. She doesn't get just the sounds right, but also the music and the attitude".

500|$|Millard also noted, [...] "Not a lot {{of songs}} mention the {{foundation}} of what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin, he died on the cross, he rose again. Just {{the basic principles of}} Christianity". He also commented that [...] "the song kind of takes us there, I say 'kind of' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born, but it was instantly a Christmas song... but it does, the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross, basically." [...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kant also {{credited}} David Hume with awakening {{him from}} dogmatic slumber (circa 1771). Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds.

Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems. He did not publish any work in philosophy for the next 11 years.|$|E

2500|$|The Church of the P{{residents}} {{was where}} the wealthy summer residents worshipped. Famous families such as the Goulds, Vanderbilts, Sloans, and, Drexels had palatial summer residences nearby. A newspaper reporter in 1886 estimated that the net worth {{of a small group}} of Sunday morning congregants was more than $250 million. During summertime in the Gay Nineties, an $8,000 Sunday collection was not unusual. However, by 1925 the chapel was in dire financial straits, and only by generous contributions of local townspeople was it saved. A New York real estate magnate, Henry Levy, paid off its back taxes, despite not being a member of the church, or a Christian. He remarked, [...] "Although we are not of the same faith, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same God." [...] This was only a temporary reprieve for the church.|$|E

That is why ... he {{wanted to create a}} unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day." [...] This applied also to strictures of religion.

2500|$|In the 1960s {{more than}} three {{quarters}} of the regular cinema audience were lost as consequence of the rising popularity of TV sets at home. As a reaction to the artistic and economic stagnation of German cinema, a group of young film-makers issued the Oberhausen Manifesto on February 28, 1962. This call to arms, which included Alexander Kluge, Edgar Reitz, Peter Schamoni and Franz-Josef Spieker among its signatories, provocatively declared [...] "Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen" [...] ("The old cinema is dead. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new cinema"). Other up-and-coming filmmakers allied themselves to this Oberhausen group, among them Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Jean-Marie Straub, Wim Wenders, Werner Schroeter and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg in their rejection of the existing German film industry and their determination to build a new cinema founded on artistic and social measures rather than commercial success. Most of these directors organized themselves in, or partially co-operated with, the film production and distribution company Filmverlag der Autoren established in 1971, which throughout the 1970s brought forth a number of critically acclaimed films.|$|E
2500|$|While it was Massoud's stated {{conviction}} {{that men and}} women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome.

2500|$|Farnsworth said, [...] "There {{had been}} {{attempts}} {{to devise a}} television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors — all mechanical. My contribution was {{to take out the}} moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14." [...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen.

2500|$|The modern Greek Homerist Ioannis Kakridis may be {{compared}} with Eratosthenes in his approach to the problem. He argued that the Odyssey {{is a work of}} poetry and not a travel log. To attempt a quick outline of Kakridis's views, it is useless to try to locate the places mentioned in Odysseus' narrative on the map; we cannot confuse the narrative of Odyssey with history unless <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existence of gods, giants and monsters. Kakridis admits that one may indeed ask what real locations inspired these imaginary places, but one must always bear in mind that geography is not the main concern either of Odysseus (as narrator) or of the poet. Similarly, Merry and Riddell, in their late 19th century school edition of the Odyssey, state the following opinion: [...] "Throughout these books [...] we are in a wonderland, which we shall look in vain for on the map". W. B. Stanford in his mid 20th century edition comments as follows on book 9 lines 80-81 (where Odysseus says that he met storms off Cape Malea near the island of Cythera): [...] "These are the last clearly identifiable places in O.'s wanderings. After this he leaves the sphere of Geography and enters Wonderland ..." [...] Thereafter, while frequently referring to ancient opinions on the location of Odysseus's adventures, Stanford makes little or no reference to modern theories.|$|E
2500|$|Romero preached that [...] "The most {{profound}} social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian." [...] He also emphasized: [...] "The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not {{reduced to the}} dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, {{what is the meaning}} of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will never admit a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E
