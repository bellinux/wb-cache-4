30|$|The {{government}} has intentions {{to limit the}} use of plastic in local packaging and increase composting, {{in an effort to}} reduce the amount of <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> landfills which will be complimented by the city opening new landfill sites in the Doro, Dertu- Mojo, Bole and YekaAbado districts distributed across the city. Recycling remains limited but is likely to increase with the establishment of central recycling depots for metal and plastic. There is limited citywide waste collection. Instead city neighbourhoods (“kebeles”) are responsible for collecting rubbish in partnership with private companies, but collection costs remain high. As for policy Addis Ababa does not encourage proper waste management by citizens and fails to impose measures such as bans on littering and making waste dumping illegal [4]. On the other hand, Addis Ababa fares fairly well in the collection and disposal of special waste as it has facilities to deal with chemical and pharmaceutical waste.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the EU {{landfill}} directive is the reduction of biodegradable <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> landfill on a solely quantitative basis. Trials on the bio-mechanical treatment {{and its effect on}} the landfill behaviour show that the quality of the remaining organic fraction for landfilling should be considered because it is is more relevant than the quantity of biodegradable waste, in terms of the level of gaseous emissions from landfill. This leads to the incongruous situation where one could treat the waste to reduce the environmental impact of landfill, with respect to landfill gas emissions and leachate, by more than 90 % but still not achieve the EU landfill threshold values. To recognize the ability of bio-mechanical waste treatment (BMWT) to reduce the environmental impact of waste disposed of in landfill this paper proposes to implement an appropriate parameter, respiration activity, with a threshold value of 10 mg/g DM to determine the success of bio-mechanical treatment. ...|$|R

The value of separation of heat-generating fission products and actinides in different fuel cycles is discussed.

40|$|As a {{generator}} of transuranic (TRU) and TRU mixed <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), the Hanford Site {{must ensure that}} its TRU waste meets the requirements of US. Department of Energy (DOE) 0 435. 1, ''Radioactive Waste Management,'' and the Contact-Handled (CH) Transuranic Waste Acceptance Criteria for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP-WAC). WIPP-WAC requirements are derived from the WIPP Technical Safety Requirements, WIPP Safety Analysis Report, TRUPACT-II SARP, WIPP Land Withdrawal Act, WIPP Hazardous Waste Facility Permit, and Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 191 / 194 Compliance Certification Decision. The WIPP-WAC establishes the specific physical, chemical, radiological, and packaging criteria for acceptance of defense TRU waste shipments at WIPP. The WPP-WAC also requires that participating DOE TRU waste generator/treatment/storage sites produce site-specific documents, including a certification plan, that describe their program for managing TRU waste and TRU waste shipments before transferring waste to WIPP. Waste characterization activities provide much of the data upon which certification decisions are based. Waste characterization requirements for TRU waste and TRU mixed waste that contains constituents regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) are established in the WIPP Hazardous Waste Facility Permit Waste Analysis Plan (WAP). The Hanford Site Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPjP) (HNF- 2599) implements the applicable requirements in the WAP and includes the qualitative and quantitative criteria for making hazardous waste determinations. The Hanford Site must also ensure that its TRU <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> disposal at WPP meets requirements for transport in the Transuranic Package Transporter- 11 (TRUPACT- 11). The US. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) establishes the TRUPACT- 11 requirements in the Safety Analysis Report for the TRUPACT-II Shipping Package (TRUPACT- 11 SARP). In addition, a TRU waste is eligible for disposal at WIPP only if it has been generated {{in whole or in}} part by one or more of the activities listed in Section 10101 (3) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. DOE sites must determine that each waste stream to be disposed of at WIPP is ''defense'' TRU waste. (See also the definition of ''defense'' TRU waste.).

40|$|Since 1983, {{under the}} Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (42 U. S. C. 10101 et seq.), the U. S. Department of Energy (the Department) has been {{investigating}} a site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{to determine whether it}} is suitable for development as the nation's first repository for permanent geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. By far, the largest quantity of <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> geologic disposal is spent nuclear fuel from 118 commercial nuclear power reactors at 72 power plant sites and 1 commercial storage site across the United States. Currently, 104 of these reactors are still in operation and generate about 20 percent of the country's electricity. Under standard contracts that DOE executed with the utilities, DOE is to accept spent nuclear fuel from the utilities for disposal. Until that happens, the utilities must safely store their spent nuclear fuel in compliance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations. As of December 1998, commercial spent nuclear fuel containing approximately 38, 500 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) was stored in 33 states. The balance of the <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> geologic disposal in a repository is Department-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Department's spent nuclear fuel includes naval spent nuclear fuel and irradiated fuel from weapons production, domestic research reactors, and foreign research reactors. For disposal in a geologic repository, high-level radioactive waste would be processed into a solid glass form and placed into approximately 20, 000 canisters. No liquid or hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 would be disposed of in a geologic repository. The difficulty in siting new facilities, particularly those designed as nuclear or nuclear-related facilities, is well documented. In this context, national boundaries are not significant distinguishing barriers. As one publication observed, ''Environmental activists, local residents and governmental officials are protesting proposed waste facilities from Taiwan to Texas''. Here in Nevada, Yucca Mountain is no exception. The Department's study of the Yucca Mountain site for possible development as a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste has been criticized by many, for many reasons.

30|$|The study re-affirms the {{position}} that a global depletion of natural resources leads to a global competition for resources and therefore the future competitiveness and vulnerability of cities are dictated by cities’ ability to shift to a less resource-intensive production and way of life, with less waste generation and increased recycling (EU 2011). Clearly, there is a compelling need to reduce the volume of <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> dumpsites in Accra. The city authorities’ apparent addiction to ‘landfilling’ is damaging for the environment and a manifestation of our failure to see waste as a potential resource. The situation in Accra {{may not be an}} isolated case, as most cities countrywide lag behind in terms of policy and practice. The religious enforcement of some ‘by-laws’ such as the “pay-as-you-dump” policy, which were seemingly enacted without reference to local knowledge, is tantamount to punishing the public. Rather, attempts should be made to give residents incentives {{to do the right thing}} and the YES project is a microcosm of such a model.|$|R
40|$|By {{the time}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) completes its Disposal Phase in FY 2034, the Department of Energy (DOE) will have {{disposed}} of approximately 109, 378 cubic meters (m 3) of Transuranic (TRU) waste in WIPP (1). If DOE adheres to its 2005 Pollution Prevention Goal of generating less than 141 m 3 /yr of TRU waste, approximately 5000 m 3 (4 %) of that TRU waste will be newly generated (2).

Plastic pollution can unfavourably affect lands, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can also be affected through entanglement, direct ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that cause interruptions in biological functions. Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through the disruption of the thyroid hormone axis or hormone levels. In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which an estimated mere 24% makes it into recycling systems.

A discussion of forest carbon storage, an important input in calculating the emission benefits of paper product recycling, is also included in this chapter. 1. A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF RECYCLING EPA defines recycling as “minimizing waste generation by recovering and reprocessing usable products that might otherwise become waste (i. e., recycling of aluminum cans, paper and bottles, etc.) ” (EPA, 2008). WARM considers the recycling of post-consumer materials, which are defined as “materials or finished products that have served their intended use and have been diverted or recovered from <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> disposal, having completed their lives as consumer items ” (EPA, 2008). Recycling {{is a process that}} takes materials or products that are at end of life and transforms them into either (1) the same product or (2) a secondary product (see discussion of open- and closedloop recycling). When a material is recycled, it is used in place of virgin inputs in the manufacturing process, rather than being disposed of and managed as waste. Consequently, recycling provides GHG reduction benefits in two ways, depending upon the material recycled: (1) it offsets a portion of “upstream ” GHGs emitted in raw material acquisition, manufacture and transport of virgin inputs an...|$|R

Department of Energy (DOE) demonstrate, for any sites wishing to ship TRU waste to the WIPP for disposal, that they possess adequate process knowledge of the TRU waste proposed for disposal in the WIPP. Condition 3 also requires DOE to implement a system of controls at TRU waste sites to ensure that, once emplaced, the actual WIPP waste inventory will comply with the assumptions underlying the analysis of WIPP=s performance (the WIPP Performance Assessment, or PA).

Similar requirements exist for spent fuel and residues. At present, no nondestructive assay instrumentation is capable of satisfying all of the PDP test cycles. One of the primary methods for waste assay is by active neutron intezrooation. The authors plan to improve the capability of all active neutron systems by providing a higher intensity neutron source (by about a factor of 1, 000) for essentially the same cost, power, and space requirements as existing systems. This high intensity neutron source will be an electrostatically confined (IEC) plasma device. The IEC is a symmetric sphere that was originally developed in the 1950 s as a possible fusion reactor. It operates as D-T neutron generator. Although it was not believed to scale to fusion reactor levels, these experiments demonstrated a neutron yield of 2 x 10 10 neutrons/second on table-top experiments that could be powered from ordinary laboratory circuits (1 kilowatt). Subsequently, the IEC physics has been extensively studied at the University of Illinois. The basis for scaling the output up to 1 x 10 11 n/s has been established. In addition, IEC devices have run for cumulative times approaching 10, 000 hours. They have been operated in pulsed-and continuous mode. ...|$|R

The proposed repository site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is far more isolated from the general population than any sites where these radioactive materials are presently located. Only solid forms of high-level wastes will be transported for disposal in a geologic repository. For more than 50 years, nuclear materials have been safely transported in North America, Europe, and Asia, without a single significant radiation release. Since the 1950 s, select panels from the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council and interagency advisory groups, and international experts selected by the OECD/Nuclear Energy Agency, have examined the environmental, ethical, and intergenerational aspects of nuclear waste disposal, plus alternatives to geologic disposal. All have concluded that deep geologic disposal in a mined repository is clearly the preferred option. The concept of deep geologic disposal is based on the analogy to ore deposits, which are formed deep within the Earth's crust, commonly remain isolated from the biosphere for millions to billions of years, and are, generally, extremely difficult to detect. Before selecting the unsaturated tuffs at Yucca Mountain, DOE evaluated salt formations, basalts, and both crystalline and sedimentary rocks.

In the case of oven-dried density, the averages between the two groups were almost the same. 2. The strength values of group 2 were all higher than those of group 1 with the exception of shear strength. It is assumed that the domestic major construction species is a type of hard pine according to the obtained physical and mechanical properties, and visual characteristics. 3. The main fracture mode of group 1 is that of cross grain tension. In the case of group 2, the fracture modes are distinguished by a mixed mode rather than by one type of mode. Failure types for compressive strength are all of a crushing failure type {{with the exception of the}} splitting failure type for specimen 7 in group 2. 4. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of mechanical properties. However, there was an obvious visual difference between the two groups...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{compliance with the}} Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) waste characterization program, each testing and analytical facility performing waste characterization activities participates in the Performance Demonstration Program (PDP). The PDP serves as a quality control check against expected results and provides information {{about the quality of}} data generated in the characterization of <b>waste</b> <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> WIPP. Single blind audit samples are prepared and distributed by an independent organization to each of the facilities participating in the PDP. There are three elements within the PDP: analysis of simulated headspace gases, analysis of solids for Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) constituents, and analysis for transuranic (TRU) radionuclides using nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques. Because the analysis for TRU radionuclides using NDA techniques involves both the counting of drums and standard waste boxes, four PDP plans are required to describe the activities of the three PDP elements. In accordance with these PDP plans, the reviewing and approving authority for PDP results and for the overall program is the CBFO PDP Appointee. The CBFO PDP Appointee is responsible for ensuring the implementation of each of these plans by concurring with the designation of the Program Coordinator and by providing technical oversight and coordination for the program. The Program Coordinator will designate the PDP Manager, who will coordinate the three elements of the PDP. The purpose of this management plan is to identify how the requirements applicable to the PDP are implemented during the management and coordination of PDP activities. The other participants in the program (organizations that perform site implementation and activities under CBFO contracts or interoffice work orders) are not covered under this management plan. Those activities are governed by the organization’s quality assurance (QA) program and procedures or as otherwise directed by CBFO...|$|R
40|$|To {{consolidate}} metallic {{waste that}} is residual from Argonne National Laboratory's electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel, waste ingots {{are currently being}} cast using an induction furnace located in a hot cell. These ingots, which {{have been developed to}} serve as final <b>waste</b> forms <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> repository disposal, are stainless steel (SS) -Zr alloys (the Zr is very near 15 wt. %). The charge for the alloys consists of stainless steel cladding hulls, Zr from the fuel being treated, noble metal fission products, and minor amounts of actinides that are present with the cladding hulls. The actual in-dated cladding hulls have been characterized before they were melted into ingots, and the final as-cast ingots have been characterized to determine the degree of consolidation of the charge material. It has been found that ingots can be effectively cast from irradiated cladding hulls residual from the electrometallurgical treatment process by employing an induction furnace located in a hot cell...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Global {{generation}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) is now ~ 1200 Tg/yr (1 Tg = 1012 g),> 70 % of which is landfilled. Landfilling of waste contributes ~ 30 - 35 Tg methane (CH 4) annually to the world's total CH 4 emission of ~ 550 Tg/yr. Recycling and thermal treatment of waste in waste-to-energy (WtE) facilities contribute equally to diverting MSW from the <b>waste</b> stream <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> landfills and to mitigating CH 4 emission. Waste generation is estimated to more than double by 2030 indicating that CH 4 emission from waste will rise substantially {{in the absence of}} strong policies to reduce landfilling rates. To investigate the potential for future mitigation of methane emission from landfills, we developed reference projections of waste generation, recycling and landfill-gas capture, together with four WtE scenarios ranging from very conservative to very aggressive. Based on these scenarios, global 2030 CH 4 emission, including reductions from recycling, range from 86 Tg (most conservative) to 27 Tg (most aggressive). WtE appears to provide the best option for limiting future waste-related emission. 1...|$|R
