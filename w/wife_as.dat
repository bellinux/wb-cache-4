5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a <b>wife,</b> <b>as</b> a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his <b>wife.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, which never materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E

5|$|Dan Ferreira {{is a fan}} of Elvis Presley, {{portrayed as}} a womaniser and a bully. He claims to be a widower, talking about his <b>wife</b> <b>as</b> being dead, both to the {{neighbours}} and his children, but they have merely separated after she had an affair with his best friend, with whom she moved in. Ash is portrayed as the intelligent member of the family, the standard of his education being much higher than his siblings, so much so that he is a lecturer. He has an on/off problem with gambling, something that presumably led to the breakup of his first marriage, before he is seen on screen. Kareena is in a relationship with Tariq, though it is not a sexual one. Ronny works as a DJ under the name DJ Ronny Flawless, and Tariq is his best friend and promoter.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's <b>wife,</b> <b>as</b> the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht's wife's name is unknown. A {{fifteenth century}} chronicle now held by Oxford University names Ecgberht's <b>wife</b> <b>as</b> Redburga who was {{supposedly}} a relation of Charlemagne that he married {{when he was}} banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date. He is reputed {{to have had a}} half-sister Alburga, later to be recognised as a saint for her founding of Wilton Abbey. She was married to Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and on his death in 802 she became a nun, Abbess of Wilton Abbey. He was believed at one time to also be the father of Saint Eadgyth of Polesworth and Æthelstan of Kent.|$|E

50|$|Caesar {{provides}} an example of the subordinate position of women: according to him, men had the power of life and death over their <b>wives,</b> <b>as</b> they did over their children, in a similar manner to the Roman pater familias. If the head of a high ranking family died, his relatives would gather and interrogate the <b>wives</b> <b>as</b> well as the slaves, when the death seemed suspicious. Should they consider their suspicions to be correct, they would burn the wives, after torturing them in every possible way. However, he also describes the financial role of the wive as remarkably self-sufficient.|$|R

5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a <b>wife,</b> <b>as</b> she had for the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his <b>wife,</b> <b>as</b> did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E

In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new <b>wife,</b> <b>as</b> the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E

25|$|A {{wife was}} also {{seen as being}} of high value, and was therefore, usually, {{carefully}} looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as beena, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain <b>wives</b> <b>as</b> each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes <b>wives</b> <b>as</b> being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; {{in the case of}} wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their <b>wives</b> <b>as</b> having each been given an entire house for this purpose.|$|R

5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his <b>wife</b> <b>as</b> joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
5|$|Most {{owners of}} the Book of the Dead were evidently {{part of the social}} elite; they were {{initially}} reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's <b>wife</b> <b>as</b> well. Towards the beginning {{of the history of the}} Book of the Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.|$|E

When Dasima realises that she has been tricked, she begins to {{keep a close eye on}} her remaining wealth. So that he can take all of her remaining funds, Samioen calls the thug Poeasa and together they plan to kill Dasima. One night, as Dasima goes to hear a story-telling, the two accost her, kill her, and throw her body off a bridge. Samioen and Poeasa are later caught and sentenced to hang for their crime.|$|E
