25|$|Oh, praised be {{the beauty}} of this earth; the beauty, and the bloom, and the mirthfulness thereof. We lived before, and shall live again; and as we hope for a fairer world than this to come; so we came from one less fine. From each {{successive}} world, the demon Principle is more and more dislodged; he is the accursed clog from chaos, and thither, by every new translation, <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> him further and further back again. Hosannahs to this world! so beautiful itself, and the vestibule to more. Out of some past Egypt, we have come to this new Canaan, and from this new Canaan, we press on to some Circassia.|$|E
500|$|Then-president George W. Bush, {{when asked}} whether he would watch the film, responded: [...] "Doubt it." [...] “New {{technologies}} will change how we live and how <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> our cars, which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E
6000|$|... "When we ketch {{the wild}} hosses <b>we</b> can <b>drive</b> {{them down the}} valley an' round to the road," [...] said Blinky, evidently by way of excuse. [...] "It'll be longer, but easy travelin'. Shore <b>we</b> couldn't <b>drive</b> any broomtails heah." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold {{only came}} {{back when the}} {{carriage}} came round, and no sooner had <b>we</b> <b>driven</b> off than I broke out--"Harry, I had no notion matters had gone so far. Fancy, Lady Diana consulting her brother! It must be very near a crisis. I can't think why you did not stay to see it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "They Landed Inside My Head While <b>We</b> Were <b>Driving</b> in the Taxi up to 53rd Street and Took Over!" ...|$|R
2500|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con 2010, Way {{announced}} that the band had finished recording the fourth studio album. This was later confirmed by Iero on the band's website, announcing that the album was [...] "done, finished, kaput, in the proverbial can, and being played loudly as <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> way too fast in our respective cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|During congressional {{hearings}} held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., {{and in a}} show of support, Ford's Alan Mulally stated that [...] "We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions". Mulally went on to state that [...] "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" [...] and that Ford Motor Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that [...] "In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> transformational change in our company" [...] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, a new {{agreement}} was made which allows Scottish Gaelic {{to be used}} formally between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. [...] This does not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU, but gives it {{the right to be}} a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government will {{have to pay for the}} translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said that [...] "Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed". Culture Minister Mike Russell said that [...] "this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That, {{for your}} moiety's and rotaries, and items, man; a jaded ass is a jaded ass, and he who denies it {{is but a}} brother of the beast itself. Now, captain, are <b>we</b> <b>driven</b> to choose one of two evils. We must either abandon this man, who has been too much with us through good and bad to be easily cast away, or we must seek a cover to let the animal rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anywhere you like. It's so warm <b>we</b> might <b>drive</b> {{instead of}} going indoors. We might go to the Bois. That would be agreeable." ...|$|R
2500|$|While most press {{coverage}} {{continued to be}} positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like The Nation and The New Republic, one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. Francis Fisher Kane, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings....We appear to be attempting to repress a political party....By such methods <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before." [...] Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an [...] "epidemic" [...] and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: [...] "The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but it certainly has the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods." [...] The Washington Post endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: [...] "There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over infringement of liberties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fondness of a creature's love, [...] How strong {{it strikes}} the sense! [...] Thither the warm {{affections}} move, [...] Nor can <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> them thence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{anxious to}} take a look at that cave where the stolen freight was stored," [...] said Sam one day. [...] "Supposing <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> to it?" ...|$|E
30|$|By {{confirming}} {{a functional}} pig muscle-specific promoter, <b>we</b> could <b>drive</b> fat-related gene overexpression in skeletal muscle and improve IMF content via {{the development of}} transgenic pigs.|$|R
6000|$|... "He writes from Lower Brixton," [...] said Mycroft Holmes. [...] "Do you {{not think}} that <b>we</b> might <b>drive</b> to him now, Sherlock, and learn these particulars?" ...|$|R
60|$|Next <b>we</b> were <b>driven</b> to Dryburgh, {{or rather}} {{to the banks}} of the Tweed, where a ferryman, with a small skiff waits to take {{passengers}} over.|$|R
6000|$|Milt {{followed}} Pinky {{out of the}} door, snarling, [...] "Git in the car, and do it quick. I'll {{take you}} clear to Blewett Pass. <b>We</b> <b>drive</b> all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>drive</b> away together, and I awake {{from the}} dream. I believe it at last. It is my dear, dear, little wife beside me, whom I love so well! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ah, {{that is the}} point. Jump in and we {{can talk}} it over while <b>we</b> <b>drive.</b> You {{remember}} that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{said and}} did nothing until <b>we</b> had <b>driven</b> {{out of sight and}} earshot. Then Kate laid down the reins and laughed until the tears came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a mighty}} good thing <b>we</b> didn't <b>drive</b> in here. <b>We</b> {{might have had}} a job turning around on that rough ice," [...] {{answered}} Spouter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps all is then well, and <b>we</b> have <b>driven</b> off {{our enemies}} without doing them any harm. Are you {{strong enough to}} keep them at a distance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cattle," [...] was the answer. [...] "Two heifers a week. <b>We</b> <b>drive</b> {{them for}} him {{at the foot of the}} hill. It is his custom. If we did not, he might seek us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must put}} your stick and gloves in the rack there," [...] she continued, [...] "and make {{yourself}} quite comfortable. <b>We</b> <b>drive</b> {{a short distance}} into the country, {{if you do not}} mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you worry}} about him, dolly. He's a very {{energetic}} chap. And---- Uh---- Mightn't <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> on a little farther, perhaps? I confess that the thought of our recent guest still in this vicinity----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, {{you will}} soon be all right again, and <b>we</b> shan't <b>drive</b> so fast now we are quite safe. There, let's {{have a look at}} your wound." ...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{extended}} {{forms of the}} Heisenberg uncertainty principle from string theory and the quantum gravity theory, <b>we</b> <b>drived</b> Hawking temperature of a Taub-Nut-(A) dS black hole. In spite of their distinctive natures such as asymptotically locally flat and breakdown of the area theorem of the horizon for the black holes, we show that the corrections to Hawking temperature by the generalized versions of the the Heisenberg uncertainty principle increases like the Schwarzschild-(A) dS black hole and give {{the reason why the}} Taub-Nut-(A) dS metric may have AdS/CFT dual picture. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} productivity {{growth in the}} 4 -digit SIC food and beverages manufacturing industries in the US for the period 1986 - 96 using Balk's (2001) decomposition of the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). The empirical results suggest that for {{the overwhelming majority of}} industries productivity changes <b>we</b> <b>driven</b> primarily by technical change and technical efficiency change. A comparison between the Divisia index estimates provided by the US NBER and the MPI estimates shows that they had different distributions and the former were systematically lower than the latter.

6000|$|... 'Why should <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> this {{stranger}} {{back to the}} palace? Let us kill him, {{and then we can}} say to the king that we slew the dragon and saved the princess, and one of us shall marry her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{reached this}} one," [...] said my friend, [...] "by sitting upon five pillows and {{consuming}} {{an ounce of}} shag. I think, Watson, that if <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Treffry raised himself, {{crossed the}} room, {{and touched the}} bell. [...] "Tell the groom," [...] he said to Dominique, [...] "to put the horses to, and have 'em round at once; bring my old boots; <b>we</b> <b>drive</b> all night...." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{this is true}} for men, it is {{much more}} true for women. Teach a woman to act from an idea, and you destroy her womanhood for ever. Make a woman self-conscious, and her soul is barren as a sandbag. Why were <b>we</b> <b>driven</b> out of Paradise? Why did we fall into this gnawing disease of unappeasable dissatisfaction? Not because we sinned. Ah, no. All the animals in Paradise enjoyed the sensual passion of coition. Not because we sinned. But because we got our sex into our head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why am I here? Why am I, and {{six hundred}} {{thousand}} {{subjects of the}} Queen, honest, loyal, and industrious, why are we, after manfully struggling for years, and each year sinking lower in the scale, why are <b>we</b> <b>driven</b> from our innocent and happy homes, our country cottages that we loved, first to bide in close towns without comforts, and gradually to crouch into cellars, or find a squalid lair like this, without even the common necessaries of existence; first the ordinary conveniences of life, then raiment, and, at length, food, vanishing from us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, sir," [...] said Young, heartily, [...] "don't {{give way}} to despondency. You know <b>we</b> were <b>driven</b> to act as we did, and it can't be helped now." ...|$|R
