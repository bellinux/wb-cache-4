500|$|As the President lay, wounded, he enquired [...] "Is Mark there?"; {{the doctors}} {{told him that}} Senator Hanna was present, but {{that he should not}} exert himself with an interview. [...] McKinley {{appeared}} to be improving, and Hanna, with the doctors' reassurance, left Buffalo for an encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic in Cleveland, at which Hanna was to speak. [...] While there, he received a telegram stating that the President had taken a turn for the worse, and hurried back to Buffalo. [...] There he found an unconscious McKinley, whose sickbed had become a deathbed. [...] On the evening of September 13, Hanna was allowed to see the dying man, as were others close to the President, such as his wife and his brother, Abner McKinley. [...] Hanna, weeping, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> in the Milburn House where the President lay, and as he awaited the end, made the necessary plans and arrangements to return his friend's remains to Canton. [...] At 2:15am on September 14, President McKinley died.|$|E
500|$|Newcomer {{conceived}} Joust as a [...] "flying game" [...] with cooperative two-player gameplay; however, he did {{not wish}} to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like Asteroids and Defender. To that end, Newcomer made a list of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, he chose birds, believing that they would have a wide appeal. Newcomer also felt that birds were a good fit as he was familiar with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>library</b> to study mythology. He felt that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded the designer. Instead, Newcomer chose an ostrich because he thought a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate {{between the first and second}} player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design.|$|E
