500|$|Another Side of Bob Dylan, {{recorded}} {{on a single}} evening in June 1964, had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] and [...] "Motorpsycho Nightmare". [...] "Spanish Harlem Incident" [...] and [...] "To Ramona" [...] are passionate love songs, while [...] "Black Crow Blues" [...] and [...] "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like <b>We</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Have</b> Met)" [...] suggest {{the rock and roll}} soon to dominate Dylan's music. [...] "It Ain't Me Babe", on the surface a song about spurned love, {{has been described as a}} rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic [...] "Chimes of Freedom", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as [...] "chains of flashing images," [...] and [...] "My Back Pages", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction.|$|E
500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>have.</b> Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Constant" [...] is {{the second}} Lost episode to deal {{directly}} {{with the concept of}} time travel after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. [...] While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device [...] "in a way <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> before and never will again" [...] and while promoting [...] "The Constant", he said that it [...] "upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it." [...] Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. [...] The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes"—although, Lindelof has said that [...] "The Constant" [...] is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show—by Ms. Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. [...] Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. [...] The writers hoped that [...] "The Constant" [...] would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. [...] Lindelof reminisced that [...] "just breaking that episode was such a massive headache" [...] and Cuse added that [...] "it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week".|$|E

500|$|The Escapist, {{thinking}} {{the issues of}} a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took [...] "vigorous exception" [...] to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>have,</b> we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E

5000|$|At the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October - 4 November 1942) Allied forces {{broke the}} Axis line and forced {{them all the}} way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: [...] "Now this is not the end; it is not even the {{beginning}} of the end.

5000|$|We have a {{very good}} system now in terms of {{political}} stability... {{one of the reasons why}} we have had this wonderful stability is because of the constitutional linkages from Crown to Governor-General to Prime Minister at the Federal level, and Crown to Governor to Premiers at the State level.

So the system as it is has worked very well. Governor-General Michael Jeffery, 2003 ...|$|R
