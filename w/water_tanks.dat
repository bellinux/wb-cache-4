5|$|As Alcatraz had {{no water}} supply of its own, {{it had to}} import it from the mainland, brought by tug and barge. During the island's {{military}} years, there were in-ground <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> were situated {{on the roof of}} the citadel. The water tower was built in 1940–41 by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, after the island received a government renovations grant to supply the majority of the island's fresh water.|$|E

50|$|The game also {{includes}} an aquarium screensaver, which the user can personalize. Initially, the game {{comes with the}} option to make the <b>tank</b> a fresh <b>water</b> or salt <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> Only two types of fish come with the main game: goldfish (for the fresh <b>water</b> <b>tank)</b> and clownfish (for the salt <b>water</b> <b>tank).</b>|$|R
25|$|A hot <b>water</b> storage <b>tank</b> (also {{called a}} hot <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> thermal storage <b>tank,</b> hot <b>water</b> thermal storage unit, heat storage <b>tank</b> and hot <b>water</b> cylinder) is a <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> used for storing {{hot water for}} space heating or {{domestic}} use.|$|R
50|$|A main <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> {{is often}} fitted {{to the floor}} of the van. It holds fresh water, {{supplying}} water directly to the high pressure pump or the mixer tank. When such a <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is installed, an on-demand supply pump is bolted to the main <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> supplying <b>water</b> to the mixer tank or high pressure pump.|$|R
5|$|On Mauritius, {{power and}} water were {{gradually}} restored following the storm, and people without power used generators. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided $10,000 (1989USD) {{to the country}} to purchase <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and saws.|$|E
5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|On the {{confines}} of the island feuds were vicious, and one surgeon went insane. Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension, keeping the garrison on edge. Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island, building roads, <b>water</b> <b>tanks,</b> a storehouse, and developing the gardens on Green Mountain. For these efforts, Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension, and additionally asked for convicts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} solve the problem of {{inadequate}} water pressure in the southern and southeast area of City K, high level <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is to be built in different locations of network system to improve this situation. When it is low peak period at night, the excess produced water will be transferred into the high level <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> Otherwise, during the peak period of the daytime, network will be supplied by water treatment plants and high <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> together so as to balance the network pressure. This paper analyses the different high <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> building plans through hydraulic model simulating, thus, providing an economical and reasonable suggestion to the network's modification...|$|R
5|$|The state {{government}} {{has decided to}} take over the upkeep of this temple, which is presently with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This temple is notified as an Ancient Monument (N-AP-50) by ASI. The two sacred <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> – Rama theertham and Lakshmana theertham – are located in the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Sirkazhi Circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Sirkazhi municipality from the Kollidam river; it is distributed through five <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> which supply 2million (two million) litres a day. Push carts and tricycles are used to collect solid waste, which is deposited in marsh lands located outside the town. Sirkazhi municipality is implementing underground drainage and the current sewerage system is through septic tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry away untreated sewage, which is released into the sea or accumulates in low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone had hit, the Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food blankets and utensils.|$|E
50|$|The Thomas Gooding <b>Water</b> <b>Tank</b> House near Shoshone, Idaho, United States, is an {{elevated}} <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> structure {{that was built}} of stone in 1919 by sheep rancher and stonemason Bill Darrah. It was built for Thomas Gooding. The elevated <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is supported on five I-beams. It is a 20 ft tall 12 ft diameter structure. Originally a windmill was atop the structure to lift the water, but is no longer present.|$|R
50|$|The American Water Works Association is a {{reservoir}} of <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> knowledge; the association provides specifications {{for a variety of}} <b>water</b> storage <b>tank</b> applications as well as design. The AWWA's site provides scientific resources with which the reader will be able to develop an informed perspective on which to make decisions regarding their <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> requirements.|$|R
50|$|Hurst Lane Halt had {{a wooden}} shelter and {{telephone}} box, {{together with a}} <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> on wooden trestles. There were points for a siding near the shelter, but this was never laid. The <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> was gone by the late 1940s.|$|R
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, the brewery <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E
50|$|A wooden <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> was {{positioned}} outside the locomotive shed from the station's opening, {{being replaced by}} a standard GWR <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> with decorative supports and coaling stage underneath in 1899; this itself {{was replaced by a}} Braithwaite tank in the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the rear}} bunker carried only coal, an {{additional}} large underbelly <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> under the boiler {{compensated for the}} resulting diminished water capacity. All the engine's water was carried in the front bunker tank and in the underbelly <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> with a combined capacity of 6000 imp gal, while the rear bunker had a coal capacity of 13 lt 10 lcwt t. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, coal bunker, {{as well as the}} underbelly <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|R

5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals {{in their seats}} or bunks). As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 6.39in (162mm), {{and strong}} winds caused {{extensive}} property damage in Nicaragua. Six people were confirmed {{to have been}} killed by Beta in Nicaragua, one of which was caused by a heart attack. It was initially feared that ten others, who were listed as missing, were killed when their vessel disappeared during the storm. But they were later rescued by a Panamanian vessel after drifting in the waters for several hours. Throughout the country, a total of 376 latrines, 215 homes, two schools, two community children centres, two community <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and five solar panels were destroyed. An additional 852 homes, 21 schools, and three health centres were damaged. The cost to repair damages caused by the hurricane were estimated at $2.1million (2006USD). A total of 2,668 people were left homeless {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

50|$|The James Bothwell <b>Water</b> <b>Tank</b> House is a <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> house {{located on}} a farm 3.25 mi north of Jerome, Idaho. The {{building}} was constructed circa 1926 for James Bothwell, a local lawyer and farmland investor. Bothwell built the tank house and a well on the property to help provide water for the farm. The building was constructed with lava rock by stonemason John Gott, who was trained in Germany. It {{is one of two}} original rock <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> houses remaining in Jerome and Lincoln Counties.|$|R
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} Oaxaca and Guerrero asked UNICEF for assistance, {{specifically}} <b>water</b> <b>tanks,</b> water pumps, and construction material. International aid initially focused almost {{solely on the}} damage in Acapulco. By {{a week after the}} hurricane, 500communities in Oaxaca remained isolated and without assistance, with several large communities in Guerrero not receiving any material aid by a week after the hurricane. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency organized about 7tons of food and clothing, and sent a bus of 40people to help isolated villages in southern Mexico. Around ten days after the hurricane struck, 20,000people were still isolated from emergency crews and relief works, causing the president to suspect people could begin starving to death. Helicopters were initially sent to the remote areas, though severe fog and heavy rainfall after the hurricane grounded the operations. The government worked to bring food to remote mountain communities, though officials noted the serious risk in doing so.|$|E
5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E
