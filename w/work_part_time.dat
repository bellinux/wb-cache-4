5000|$|In the Netherlands {{women have}} entered the {{workforce}} relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the marriage bar and the marital power of the husband, {{it was only in}} 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.Also, according to The Economist, [...] "Dutch politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the European Communities report Women in the European Community found that [...] "it is in the Netherlands (17.6%) and in Ireland (13.6%) that we see the smallest numbers of married women working and the least acceptance of this phenomenon by the general public". (pg 14). From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women <b>work</b> <b>part</b> <b>time.</b> In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.|$|E
5000|$|In the Nordic countries, {{marriage}} and having children have far greater effects on women than on men, {{partly due to}} the expectation that women will continue unpaid domestic labor. However, the Nordic countries have worked to make the dual-earner household the norm, with nationalized childcare, parental leave, and flexible working hours making it possible for women to continue to work. According to a 2007 UNICEF report, in Sweden, although parents are given 12 months of parental leave time that can be divided between the two as each couple sees best, gender norms continue to have an effect: mandated maternity leave combined with Sweden allowing women to reduce work hours after giving birth means that nearly half of mothers in dual-income families work less than full-time. Although women in Nordic countries have a high overall labour participation, there is a strong segregation by gender with women being often found in certain work sectors, which have a working culture adapted to family life, with flexible hours and offers of part-time jobs, and men working in other sectors. According to the Nordic Information on Gender [...] "The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why {{women are more likely to}} <b>work</b> <b>part</b> <b>time</b> in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe". However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time - as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland. Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of 0 - 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only 48% of Norwegian.As of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate). This compared with the EU28 rate of 58.8% female vs 69% male.|$|E
40|$|As {{in other}} {{hospital}} specialties, an increasing proportion of neurology trainees are female. To predict the workforce implications {{it is necessary}} to determine what life choices future neurologists will make. A questionnaire survey of life choices was administered to neurology consultants and trainees, general medical senior house officers, and medical students. Of the 344 respondents, 3 % of specialist registrars (SpRs) and 4. 6 % of consultants <b>work</b> <b>part</b> <b>time.</b> Eighty-seven per cent of female and 22 % of male junior doctors plan to <b>work</b> <b>part</b> <b>time</b> for, on average, 7. 5 and 1. 5 years respectively.

The changing demands of both sexes will have a greater impact on the neurology workforce than the increasing proportion of women alone. Increased part-time working will require additional trainees to ensure service requirements are met...|$|E
