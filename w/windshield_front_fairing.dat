25|$|From their inception, Vespa scooters {{have been}} known for their painted, pressed steel unibody which {{combines}} a complete cowling for the engine (enclosing the engine mechanism and concealing dirt or grease), a flat floorboard (providing foot protection), and a prominent <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> (providing wind protection) into a structural unit.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{features}} included remote keyless entry, tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel, {{and high}} solar energy-absorbing glass (HSEA) on the <b>windshield</b> and <b>front</b> windows.

50|$|The Interceptor sported racing bike {{fairings}} {{that shaped}} {{the future for}} modern sport bikes. The tank was 5.8 gallons and was shaped to keep the rider's legs tucked in to eliminate air drag. The new <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> replaced the cafe racer headlight with an aerodynamic fiberglass fairing to push the air over the rider's helmet. The lower cowl produced down force to push the 551 pound bike to the road. The <b>front</b> wheel <b>fairing</b> was designed to eliminate debris from striking the bike and causing damage. The 32.3 inch seat height provided comfort for a long trip without sacrificing the track bike stance.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{collisions}} between motor vehicles and moose is increasing in many countries. Collisions with large, high {{animals such as}} moose cause typical rear- and downward deformation of the <b>windshield</b> pillars and <b>front</b> roof, most pronounced for small passenger cars; the injury risk increases with the deformation of the car. A strengthening of the <b>windshield</b> pillars and <b>front</b> roof {{and the use of}} antilacerative windshields would reduce the injury risk to car occupants...|$|R
25|$|The <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> of the Ninja H2R {{incorporates}} stub-wings, {{which are}} made of carbon fiber just like rest of the bodywork. They may be aerodynamic devices designed to create a low-pressure zone to help move cooling air through the engine bay, or to produce downforce at high speed, or to provide straight-line stability in a short-wheelbase sportbike chassis.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the aerodynamic impact of various fuel saving devices used in a commercial vehicle (i. e., semi-trailer truck). To measure the aerodynamic drag produced by the vehicle, a wind tunnel study was undertaken using a 1 / 10 th scale model truck. The aerodynamic drags on the baseline vehicle including different external attachments (i. e., front faring, side skirting and gap filling) were measured for a range of vehicle operating speeds and yaw angles, and with different combinations. The results show that these external attachments (fairing and covering) have notable impact on aerodynamic drag as they can reduce up to around 26 % aerodynamic drag over the baseline model depending on cross wind effects. The full-skirting (using the <b>front</b> <b>fairing,</b> side skirting and gap filling) has maximum impact whereas only <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> has minimum impact on aerodynamic drag reduction...|$|R
5000|$|Fairings are {{available}} for {{the front and rear}} of the vehicle. Some riders also use a [...] "bodysock," [...] a fabric (usually lycra) covering which connects the <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> and the rear fairing, enclosing the rider for even less drag. Socks can also be run from a <b>front</b> <b>fairing</b> to an [...] "A" [...] shaped framework {{on the back of the}} seat. Or a [...] "tailsock" [...] can run from the back of the seat to the [...] "A" [...] shaped framework. A tailsock using lycra fabric and small aluminium tubes adds very little weight. Front and rear fairings have been shown to be beneficial for long wheelbase bikes, but front fairings are less beneficial for short wheelbase bikes. Front fairings and bodysocks have the advantage of blocking wind and rain on cool days, and a bodysock can help block the sun on bright days.|$|R
