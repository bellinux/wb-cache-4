5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into <b>Western</b> Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in <b>Western</b> Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and <b>Western</b> Europe to revive <b>Western</b> governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in <b>Western</b> Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in <b>Western</b> Europe.|$|E

50|$|When the {{popularity}} of television exploded in the late 1940s and 1950s, <b>westerns</b> quickly became a staple of small-screen entertainment. The first, on June 24, 1949, was the Hopalong Cassidy show, at first edited from the 66 films made by William Boyd. Many B-movie <b>Westerns</b> were aired on TV as time fillers, while a number of long-running TV <b>Westerns</b> became classics in their own right. The earliest TV <b>westerns</b> were written primarily for a children's audience; {{it was not until}} the near-concurrent debuts of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and the TV version of Gunsmoke in 1955 that adult <b>Westerns</b> appeared on television. Notable TV <b>Westerns</b> include Maverick, Gunsmoke, The Lone Ranger, The Rifleman, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Laramie, Have Gun, Will Travel, Bonanza, The Virginian, Wagon Train, The Big Valley, Maverick, The High Chaparral, The Gene Autry Show, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, and many others.|$|R
5000|$|By fall 1959 {{what the}} Hollywood studios were {{producing}} were mostly <b>Westerns.</b> According to Castleman and Podrazik (1984), [...] "the rush to <b>Westerns</b> {{had become a}} virtual stampede so that, {{by the fall of}} 1959, viewers had their choice from a staggering twenty-eight different Western-based prime time series." [...] <b>Westerns</b> were popular with audiences, but critics lamented the loss of other program formats, which had quietly vanished from the three networks' schedules. The addition of <b>Westerns</b> and game shows came at the direct expense of the live dramatic anthology series seen during television's golden age.|$|R

50|$|In reality, {{the reason}} was that the <b>Westerns</b> {{originally}} had been purchased by the DuMont channel/network to be shown in their entirety, and hosted by Captain Video, but the format was flip-flopped to become a show about Captain Video occasionally interrupted by clips from the old <b>Westerns.</b> Despite the incongruity of mixing the two genres, it was done so the cash-strapped channel would not waste the money spent acquiring the broadcast rights to the <b>Westerns.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 5th {{century the}} <b>western</b> section of the empire was divided into smaller {{political}} units, ruled by the tribes that had invaded {{in the early part of}} the century.

The Eastern Roman Empire, often referred to as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its <b>western</b> counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost <b>western</b> territories. The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, Byzantine control of most of the <b>Western</b> Empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula (Gothic War) in the reign of Justinian (r. 527–565) was the sole, and temporary, exception.|$|E
