50|$|During the Middle Ages, leather craft was developed, as turnshoes and <b>welt</b> <b>shoes</b> were invented. Refined {{kinds of}} leather such as suede and nubuck were also introduced.|$|R

"Goodyear welt construction" [...] {{involves}} stitching a welt to {{the upper}} and a strip of canvas (known as [...] "gemming") cemented to the insole of a shoe as an attach-point for the sole. The space enclosed by the welt is then filled with cork or some other filler material (usually either porous or perforated, for breathability), and the outsole is both cemented and stitched to the <b>welt.</b> <b>Shoes</b> {{with other types of}} construction may also have welts.|$|R
50|$|The welt forms {{a cavity}} {{which is then}} filled with a cork material. The final part of the shoe is the sole, which is {{attached}} to the welt by some combination of stitching and a high strength adhesive like contact cement or hide glue. The result is highly valued for being relatively waterproof by minimizing water penetration into the insole and the relative ease of resoling as long as the upper remains viable. <b>Welted</b> <b>shoes</b> are more expensive to manufacture than those mass produced by automated machinery with molded soles.|$|R
50|$|Charles Goodyear Jr. {{bought the}} rights to this machine and {{employed}} Dancel as superintendent of his factory. Soon thereafter Dancel theorized, created and patented many shoe-construction machines and associated devices. These included a machine to sew a turned shoe (one of which was converted into a stitcher) and stitch a shoe's out soles. In 1874, he created and installed on it a <b>shoe</b> <b>welt</b> guide to stitch <b>shoe</b> <b>welts.</b> This machine, purchased by his employer, is currently in use today with only minor improvements to it added.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually {{the modern}} shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the 17th century, most leather shoes {{have used a}} sewn-on sole. This remains the {{standard}} for finer-quality dress shoes today. Until around 1800, <b>welted</b> rand <b>shoes</b> were commonly made without differentiation for {{the left or right}} foot. Such shoes are now referred to as [...] "straights". Only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, {{concerned}} with rising manufacturing costs and endeavoring to compete more {{directly with the}} boat shoe and handsewn market, Allen Edmonds discontinued their Lewiston, Maine manufacturing plant and moved the handsewn production to their new, company owned factory in the Dominican Republic. Currently, shoe uppers for the Allen Edmonds handsewn collection are cut and sewn in the Dominican Republic. The raw materials are sent there from the U.S., where the uppers are sewn together, then shipped to the factory in Port Washington, Wisconsin to complete their construction, thus allowing them to be labeled [...] "Made in the USA." [...] Alternatively, styles from the [...] "ae by Allen Edmonds" [...] collection are produced entirely in and sold as Made in the Dominican Republic. In addition to their handsewn collection, Allen Edmonds also utilizes the Dominican Republic factory to cut and sew the uppers of their Goodyear <b>welted</b> collection of <b>shoes.</b> Similarly to the [...] "American Made" [...] handsewns, these welted uppers are shipped to the factory in Wisconsin, where {{the remainder of the}} lasting, welting, and soling are completed.|$|R
