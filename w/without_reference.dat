5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to the whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
5|$|When Æthelred made a {{grant to}} Berkeley Abbey in 883, {{he did it with}} the {{approval}} of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Alfred, such as at a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} point, {{the city of}} Abydos {{resigned}} its political rank to Thinis, and although Abydos would continue to enjoy supreme religious importance, its history and functions cannot be understood <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Thinis. The role of Thinis as centre of the Thinite Confederacy (or Dynasty 0) and into the Early Dynastic Period (specifically Dynasty I and Dynasty II) is taken from Manetho, and, according to Wilkinson (2000), seems to be confirmed by Dynasty I and late Dynasty II royal tombs at Abydos, the principal regional necropolis.|$|E

5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position {{relative to a}} known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|During the ceremony, the AMPAS {{presented}} Academy Awards, {{now known}} as the Oscars in twelve categories. Winners were announced three months before the live event. Some nominations were announced <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to a specific film, such as for Ralph Hammeras and Nugent Slaughter, who received nominations in the now defunct category of Engineering Effects. Unlike later ceremonies, an actor could be awarded for multiple works within a calendar year for the same category. Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both The Way of All Flesh and The Last Command. Moreover, Charlie Chaplin and Warner Brothers each received an Honorary Award.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s a {{veterinarian}} in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, {{was introduced to}} Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in Western Horsemen stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Australian registrations.|$|E

5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} the {{diversion}} General Eisenhower had hoped for. The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Kesselring's headquarters. Heidrich had expected to be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolph Bierwirth, in September, the {{battalion}} was issued with a circular brown over red Unit Colour Patch (UCP), with a border of grey to denote that {{the battalion}} was a 2nd AIF unit. However, {{the circumstances of}} the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in the situation of the battalion's personnel being issued two different UCPs. Personnel who were in the United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with the brown over red UCP. However, this UCP was issued <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of a black over green oval in a circle of grey: this was intended to link the battalion to the 33rd Battalion, which had served during the First World War. Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the brown and red patches.|$|E
5|$|In 1635, <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to {{a general}} {{assembly}} of the Parliament, the King authorised a book of canons that made him head of the Church, ordained an unpopular ritual and enforced {{the use of a}} new liturgy. When the liturgy emerged in 1637 it was seen as an English-style Prayer Book, resulting in anger and widespread rioting, said to have been set off with the throwing of a stool by one Jenny Geddes during a service in St Giles Cathedral. The Protestant nobility put themselves {{at the head of the}} popular opposition. Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the National Covenant on 28 February 1638, objecting to the King's liturgical innovations. The King's supporters were unable to suppress the rebellion and the King refused to compromise. In December of the same year, at a meeting of the General Assembly in Glasgow, the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, Antoine posted an {{advertisement}} in the Spiritist journal The Messenger (Le Messager), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt {{did not meet}} with success. At the same time, he was deeply influenced by Léon Denis' book In the Invisible. He began {{to give up his}} remedies, particularly because of his then recent trial, and gradually left Spiritism, as he was sometimes deceived by false mediums. In 1902, his group The Vine Growers of the Lord, although solicited, did not participate {{in the creation of a}} Spiritist Federation, then in 1905, the members did not attend the preparatory meeting of the Congress in Liège and refused the 0.25 franc contribution. In 1905, he consultated up to 400 patients per day. Around the same time, he published a four-page leaflet which commented passages of the Gospels <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Spiritism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} Scotland regained its {{independent}} system of law, its parliament and its kirk, {{but also the}} Lords of the Articles (through which the crown controlled parliamentary business) and bishops. It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely <b>without</b> <b>reference</b> to Parliament {{through a series of}} commissioners. These began with Middleton, now an earl, and ended with the king's brother and heir, James, Duke of York (known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany). Legislation was revoked back to 1633, by the Rescissory Act 1661, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars, but the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods were renewed. Only four Covenanters were excluded from the general pardon and were executed, the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll, but also including the Protester James Guthrie.|$|E

Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the black and red patches.|$|E
