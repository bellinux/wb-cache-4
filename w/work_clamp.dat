5000|$|In general, Ohkawa {{gets her}} {{inspiration}} for the group from everyday events such as dreams or the news. Unlike most manga artists who specialize in a single genre, Clamp has created a diverse body of <b>work.</b> <b>Clamp's</b> genres vary widely, from childish and comedic (Cardcaptor Sakura, Clamp School Detectives) to more dramatic and teen-rated (xxxHolic, X) series. Furthermore, drawing {{from the idea of}} Osamu Tezuka's Star System as they did in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Clamp often crossover characters from their own series into their other works, which gives rise to a loosely defined [...] "Clamp Universe".|$|R
50|$|Miyuki has {{appeared}} in other <b>works</b> by <b>Clamp.</b> She appears in the video collection Clamp in Wonderland (1994), and makes a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the fantasy manga series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (2003-2009).|$|R

5000|$|A Publishers Weekly review {{felt that}} reading {{the series is}} like, [...] "looking into a dystopic future through one tiny, {{perfectly}} square frame." [...] The same reviewer said that the character designs were [...] "magnificent" [...] and that, [...] "the tiny details on the clockwork birds and imaginative effects are stunning." [...] The reviewer felt that though it was obviously an experimental <b>work</b> for <b>CLAMP,</b> that the series would be widely liked.|$|R

5000|$|Magic Knight Rayearth explores [...] "fate, grim destiny, and sacrifice," [...] {{as do many}} of <b>Clamp's</b> <b>works.</b> According to Ohkawa, who {{believes}} in choosing one's fate, humanity's fate is caused by one's actions; Cephiro is merely an exaggeration of Earth.|$|R
5000|$|Rika Takahashi, from EX: The Online World of Manga, {{noted the}} work's stark {{contrast}} with other, more positive <b>CLAMP</b> <b>works</b> such as Cardcaptor Sakura and Wish. She {{stated that it}} was a fast-pace drama similar to works such X and Tokyo Babylon. She commented on CLAMP's choice of presenting the story in short sequences and in a style [...] "where the frames break out of the typical 'grid'" [...] and to produce an experience of watching a movie on paper. She also commented that the typesetting of the sound effects helped create the overall cold mood unlike other <b>CLAMP</b> <b>works.</b> Furthermore, she praised the work for retaining a high detail of the art without being too dense.|$|R

40|$|Clamping and {{referencing}} of {{work pieces}} is a main task in ultraprecision machining which strongly influences the manufacturing quality {{in terms of}} form accuracy. Especially, when manufacturing a multiple number of similar <b>work</b> pieces, the <b>clamping</b> accuracy of each work piece is crucial {{in order to keep}} the sub-micron accuracy level, which is achievable with state of the art ultraprecision machine tools, throughout the batch. Therefore, automated solutions are developed within the European Integrated Project (IP) Production 4 micro meter to realize highly reproducible production chains. Within this project, System 3 R has developed the MACRO-Nano chuck - a passive <b>work</b> piece <b>clamping</b> system with a system sub-micron accuracy. At Fraunhofer IPT, this sub-micron clamping device has been tested in an ultraprecision machining environment in order to confirm the systems accuracy by analysing the geometrical deviations of a sample geometry which has been machined with the use of the MACRO-Nano chuck. The design of the chuck as well as the machining and characterization of the samples are described in this paper...|$|R

500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{praised the}} {{character}} and Elder Bairn designs, and also enjoyed the questions the anime posed about where Blood-C fitted in both the overall Blood franchise and the <b>works</b> of <b>CLAMP.</b> He was more mixed about the odd justoposition of innocent school life with the high violence of Elder Bairn encounters. He was also unsure about the ending, saying it tidied up the series' mysteries but required watching the movie to understand the story. He ended his review by calling Blood-C [...] "a beautifully drawn show with excellent action and a legitimately compelling mystery".|$|R
