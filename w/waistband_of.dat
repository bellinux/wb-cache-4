5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> a thong or G-string when visible {{above the}} {{waistline}} of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
25|$|Alternatives to jockstraps {{include the}} jock brief, or support briefs, {{which have the}} wide <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> a jockstrap {{combined}} with a full seat and are made of an elastic supportive material. A thong style strap, sometimes called a dance belt, has one narrow elastic strap attached {{to the bottom of}} the pouch, passing between the legs and attaching to the waistband at the middle of the back. A strapless garment, called a jock sock or sometimes a slingshot, has only an elastic waist band with an elastic pouch that holds the genitals from the front.|$|E
25|$|At present, most {{trousers}} {{are held}} {{up through the}} assistance of a belt which is passed through the belt loops on the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of braces (suspenders in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of the waistband. Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective and more comfortable because it requires no cinching of the waist or periodic adjustment.|$|E

25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> the petticoat. They create a graceful, {{decorative}} effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "11001001" [...] is {{a binary}} number, a {{contraction}} {{of the names}} of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called [...] "10101001". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to [...] "The Big Goodbye", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus {{on the side of the}} headpiece through a battery pack attached to the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Next Dann {{drove the}} {{children}} {{back to their}} home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to {{set fire to the}} house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). [...] She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a [...]22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson [...]357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then re-entered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a [...]32 Smith & Wesson from the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.|$|E
5000|$|The Madonna wannabe {{trend was}} at its peak from 1984 until 1986. During that time, it was common to see young women across the world dressed in the style {{affected}} by pop star Madonna in that era: a thrift shop look that incorporated many beads, lace tops, bleached hair, rosaries, crucifixes, skirts, bracelets and bustiers. Sometimes the wannabes wore men's boxer shorts outside their clothes. Skow commented on the phenomenon:"The bright side of this trend is that these Wanna Be's (as in [...] "We wanna be like Madonna!") could be out somewhere stealing hubcaps. Instead, all of them, {{hundreds of thousands of}} young blossoms whose actual ages run from a low of about eight to a high of perhaps 25, are saving up their baby-sitting money to buy cross-shaped earrings and fluorescent rubber bracelets like Madonna's, white lace tights that they will cut off at the ankles and black tube skirts that, out of view of their parents, they will roll down several turns at the waist to expose their middles and the <b>waistbands</b> <b>of</b> the pantyhose." ...|$|R

2500|$|On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a {{few days}} before Frances was {{scheduled}} to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met inside the lobby of their apartment building in a final attempt at reconciliation. Frances was due to have dinner at the Dobbins' at 8 pm. When an argument broke out between the couple, Frances left to hail a taxi. Taxi driver Edward Pearlman picked her up at Madison Avenue and 97th Street. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, Pearlman ordered him out of the cab to which he replied, “I’m her husband, don’t worry about it.” “Where do you want to go?” Pearlman asked. “Take me to a police station,” Frances said. As the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th, they were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, “Oh my God!” Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in {{the right side of the}} head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. At the police station, an unregistered [...]32 Colt revolver was found in Rushmore's hand and a seven-inch commando knife inside the <b>waistband</b> <b>of</b> his trousers. Jean Dobbins speculated that her mother's refusal to take Rushmore to Brazil might have started the argument that ended in the shooting. Contrary to general expectations, Dobbs said her parents quarreled [...] "over personal things, not Rushmore's controversial public life ... 'He was very possessive, very jealous, and wanted to go everywhere with her." [...] Frances Rushmore's father, Louis Everitt, the owner of a women's shoe store in Charlotte, brought his daughter's body back to North Carolina.|$|E

2500|$|Synthesiomyia nudiseta is {{a species}} that {{is found to be}} quite necrophilous. Like other Muscidae species, it prefers to {{surround}} itself in a wide range from garbage to human and animal remains. S. nudiseta will pupate slowly and in a restricted environment, and prefer not to migrate far away from the resource. [...] Therefore, in stages of decomposition of forensic importance it is essential to verify all areas in close proximity to the corpse. Pupa have typically been found in victims’ clothing in places such as the elastic <b>waistbands</b> <b>of</b> pants, the inner surfaces of the victim’s clothing, and even in the space in between the body and the ground. In the life cycle during stages of decomposition, S. nudiseta will be inclined to pupate with other species of flies when they arrive later in different waves. Depending on where S. nudiseta happens to be located geographically can affect how delayed the fly will take to pupate. For instance, in Hawaii, S. nudiseta is apt to feed on carrion as a food source and pupation invades similar to the flesh fly genus Sarcophaga, which is the second general decomposition wave.|$|R

2500|$|Criticisms of Barbie {{are often}} {{centered}} around concerns that children consider Barbie {{a role model}} and will attempt to emulate her. One {{of the most common}} criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic. [...] A standard Barbie doll is 11.5inches tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9inches at [...] Barbie's vital statistics have been estimated at 36inches (chest), 18inches (waist) and 33inches (hips). According to research by the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to menstruate. [...] In 1963, the outfit [...] "Barbie Baby-Sits" [...] came with a book entitled How to Lose Weight which advised: [...] "Don't eat!". [...] The same book was included in another ensemble called [...] "Slumber Party" [...] in 1965 along with a pink bathroom scale permanently set at 110lbs., which would be around 35lbs. underweight for a woman 5 feet 9inches tall. [...] Mattel said that the waist of the Barbie doll was made small because the <b>waistbands</b> <b>of</b> her clothes, along with their seams, snaps, and zippers, added bulk to her figure. In 1997, Barbie's body mold was redesigned and given a wider waist, with Mattel saying that this would make the doll better suited to contemporary fashion designs.|$|R

Observing that Mr Feeder's were turned up, Mr Toots turned his up; but the <b>waistbands</b> <b>of</b> the next arrival being turned down, Mr Toots turned his down. The differences in point of waistcoat-buttoning, not only at the bottom, but at the top too, became so numerous and complicated as the arrivals thickened, that Mr Toots was continually fingering that article of dress, as if he were performing on some instrument; and appeared to find the incessant execution it demanded, quite bewildering. All the young gentlemen, tightly cravatted, curled, and pumped, and with their best hats in their hands, having been at different times announced and introduced, Mr Baps, the dancing-master, came, accompanied by Mrs Baps, to whom Mrs Blimber was extremely kind and condescending. Mr Baps was a very grave gentleman, with a slow and measured manner of speaking; and before he had stood under the lamp five minutes, he began to talk to Toots (who had been silently comparing pumps with him) about what you were to do with your raw materials when they came into your ports in return for your drain of gold. Mr Toots, to whom the question seemed perplexing, suggested 'Cook 'em.' But Mr Baps did not appear to think that would do.|$|R
