5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The first presenters of Blue Peter were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace {{presented}} for nearly nine years, and Williams for just {{over three years}} (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie Singleton by three months. However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975 Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 {{in the absence of}} Singleton and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing Singleton, but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admits in hindsight he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
25|$|After the Louis-Schmeling fight, Jack Dempsey {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> never had to face Joe Louis in the ring. When Louis fell on hard financial times, Dempsey served as honorary chairman of a fund to assist Louis.|$|E

25|$|Obama's only {{remaining}} {{opponent in the}} race for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Clinton, as well as past Democratic presidential candidates, offered thoughts on the speech soon after it was given.

25|$|Less popular was {{a musical}} comedy Mardi Gras (1958), {{which was the}} last movie of Edmund Goulding. However Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), a science fiction {{adventure}} tale was a huge hit. Boone had been reluctant to do it, {{and needed to be}} persuaded by being offered the chance to sing several songs and given a percentage of the profits, but <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|E

25|$|Yuya Aoki {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} GetBackers two years before it started serialization. By that time he had few notes about it. Aoki remembers giving many troubles to his editor when he started writing it, but <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> could finish it. The character of Ban Mido was originally meant to appear in another series from Aoki, but his editor liked it and {{wanted it to be}} one of the manga's protagonists. Ginji was meant to appear in the series, but his original personality was first meant to belong to Ban.|$|E
500|$|A {{description}} {{in the book}} cover flap reads, [...] "In this tender, sensitive and blackly comic novel, Sebastian Shaw, the distinguished Shakespearean actor, explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and, unfortunately, too rarely understood." [...] Shaw originally planned to call the novel The Godfather, but later said he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did not due to the popularity of Mario Puzo's book of that name. He {{was said to have}} been working on another novel shortly after The Christening was completed, but no others were ever published.|$|E
500|$|The {{drawings}} {{were finished}} and in early June 1905 Warne approved. Potter wrote she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> liked the drawings, and [...] "if the book prints well, {{it will be}} my next favourite to Tailor. She was energized with {{the completion of the}} book and wrote Warne she wanted to settle on future work before leaving for a holiday in Wales. In Merioneth she received his letter of proposal on 25 July and accepted, but he died suddenly and unexpectedly on 25 August 1905 before a marriage took place. Potter became deeply depressed and was ill for many weeks. However, she rallied to complete the last two tales she had discussed with him: The Pie and the Patty-Pan and The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Raucher {{decided to}} focus on the first major adult {{experience}} of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. On the night memorialized in the film, Raucher randomly came to visit her, unaware his arrival was just minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. She was confused and upset, had been drinking heavily, and repeatedly called Raucher by her husband's name. Although both ultimately [...] disrobed, contrary to popular opinion, sexual intercourse did not occur. Raucher admitted this in a 2002 interview saying it was mostly holding, but in the movie [...] "We let you think what you want." [...] The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him (which is read {{at the end of the}} film and reproduced in the book). He never saw her again; his last [...] "encounter" [...] with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be [...] "his" [...] Dorothy. Raucher recognized the [...] "real" [...] Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she could have known about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.|$|E

[...] "Elvis wasn't really thinking {{at that time that}} it was going to make money for Carl; he was doing it as more of a tribute type thing. Of course Carl <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did.
