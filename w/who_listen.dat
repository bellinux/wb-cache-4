[...] It showed the influences of U2, Counting Crows, Aerosmith and Pearl Jam. Jacqui Curtis of The Program felt the EP [...] "offers listeners yet another melodic rock band with ever-so-catchy tunes to add to their rotation of summer jams... delivers five delectable rock tracks." [...] Curtis described how [...] "Pellet Gun", the lead single [...] "couples hard-hitting lyrics and memorable guitar riff... and attacks every listener's past loves with an attitude and vindictiveness that the heartbroken, dumped and hard-done-by deserve. Picture yourself burning your ex's clothes and you'll find the essence of 'Pellet Gun'." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10million {{listeners}} per week, {{which made}} his show {{the third most}} widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time.

[...] He has described his show's production as one with a [...] "...hard edge combined with humor and education... Those <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein." [...] Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: [...] "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about the young people <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to our music and what their future holds for them. It's {{like you have a}} choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E

500|$|Big Machine Records {{was still}} in its infancy on the release of the lead single, [...] "Tim McGraw", in June 2006, and Swift and her mother helped [...] "stuff the CD singles into {{envelopes}} to send to radio". She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances. Borchetta has said that record industry peers disliked his signing of a 16-year-old singer-songwriter at first, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to country music. Following [...] "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar", [...] "Our Song", [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] and [...] "Should've Said No". All were highly successful on Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with [...] "Our Song" [...] and [...] "Should've Said No" [...] both reaching number one. For the former, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart. [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] became a moderate commercial success, reaching number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100. Swift also released the holiday album [...] in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008. She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.|$|E
500|$|California is the band's first release through BMG Rights Management, {{and also}} among BMG's first {{releases}} through its distribution {{deal with the}} Alternative Distribution Alliance. The album was initially slated to be released independently, but they decided to work with BMG when that label acquired Vagrant Records. Vagrant had a promotional team that, according to Blink's manager Lawrence Varra, understood the culture surrounding the band and genre. The deal allowed the band and its management to be in near-complete control of the release and promotion of California. [...] "We didn't {{have to listen to}} a major label spend the money they wanted to spend, [...] we'd just spend it ourselves the way we wanted to," [...] said Varra. Rather than [...] "window" [...] the album — an industry term for its release being exclusively physical {{for a period of time}} — the team chose to release California as wide as possible. [...] "We wanted the music to be accessible to the younger kids <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to it on YouTube and Spotify and different places," [...] he said. In addition, they employed ticketing tiers for the California Tour, making it possible for hardcore fans to obtain the best seats, but also allowing it to be affordable for more casual fans. However, a hit was not guaranteed: [...] "I was speculative leading up, and nervous. This record could have gone either way," [...] said Jon Cohen, EVP of recorded music for BMG.|$|E
500|$|Early in the book, Eric retells {{a portion}} of Homer's Odyssey, {{describing}} the episode in which Ulysses sails near {{the land of the}} Sirens: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with beeswax and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of Orpheus's encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a [...] "sweeter song" [...] than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then argues from analogy that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to the plans God has for them find waiting for marriage much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the [...] "sweeter song" [...] throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is [...] "the beautiful side of love"; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as breakups, unrequited love, and sexual frustration.|$|E

But in 2006 Tatchell noted that SCIRI had become markedly more fundamentalist and was endorsing violent attacks on anyone who did not conform to its increasingly harsh interpretation of Islam. He claimed that SCIRI, the leading force in Baghdad's ruling coalition, wanted to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship, with a goal of clerical fascism, and had engaged in [...] "terrorisation of gay Iraqis", as well as terrorising Sunni Muslims, left-wingers, unveiled women and people <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to western pop music or wear jeans or shorts.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics awarded {{praise for}} the album's raw and {{powerful}} emotions. James Skinner of Drowned in Sound commended the record for its feeling of [...] "naked emotion on display." [...] Skinner further commented on the album, stating it [...] "certainly isn’t a unanimously easy listen (that much should be clear from its title alone), but themes like those of ‘Butterfly Knife’ are leavened by that ever-present defiance." [...] Nick Neyland from Pitchfork lauded the album, calling it [...] "a fiercely individual record, made by a musician with a fearless and courageous approach to her art. Crucially, the desire to let such raw emotion out in song never feels forced." [...] Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine observed that [...] "Rock music is not an uncommon {{way to deal with}} pain, either for the people who make it or for those <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to it, but it's rare when those raw emotions translate into a record as focused and accomplished as EMA's debut". Ad Mehta from One Thirty BPM gave the record high marks, stating [...] "With fresh, sonically adventurous juxtapositions, and bold, honest lyrics, [...] engages the listener in an intense, emotional journey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{service was}} first {{broadcast}} by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928 and, except for 1930, has been broadcast every year since. During the 1930s the BBC began broadcasting the service on its overseas programmes. Even throughout the Second World War, despite {{the stained glass}} having {{been removed from the}} Chapel and the lack of heating, the broadcasts continued. For security reasons, the name [...] "King's" [...] was not mentioned during wartime broadcasts. Since the Second World War, {{it has been estimated that}} each year there are millions of listeners worldwide <b>who</b> <b>listen</b> to the service live on the BBC World Service. Domestically, the service is broadcast live on BBC Radio 4, and a recorded broadcast is made on Christmas Day on BBC Radio 3. In the US, a 1954 service was put into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2008. The broadcast has been heard live on public radio stations affiliated with American Public Media since 1979, and most stations broadcast a repeat on Christmas Day. Since 1963, the service has been periodically filmed for television broadcast in the UK. Presently, each year a programme entitled Carols from King's is pre-recorded in early or mid-December then shown on Christmas Eve in the UK on BBC Two and BBC Four. The programme is weighted more heavily in favour of carols sung by the choir, with only seven readings in total, not all of which are from the Bible.|$|E
