40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} in preserving the quality of water for distribution processes {{in order to maximize}} the fulfillment of various sectors has considerably increased. Be it domestic sources, industrial or agricultural effluents, the massive increase of industrial productions accompanied by high growth of large urban populations has led ti severe water population problems. Various chemical and biological treatments are available for degradation of <b>water</b> <b>pollutions</b> but most of them are not environmental friendly. However, effective microorganism (EM) technology is able to restore and clean <b>water</b> <b>pollutions</b> at low cost. Therefore, mathematical model for <b>water</b> <b>pollutions</b> has been implemented and the effect of EM on degradation of pollutants in river is considered. The model equations which consist of system of three one dimensional non-linear partial differential equations (ODE) has been simulated to describe the degradation of pollutants in river. Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) is used to solve the system of non-linear PDE. The effect of EM's addition on river pollution is seen from the three cases involving three different initial bacterial concentrations (25 mhL- 1, 50 mgL- 1 and 100 mgL- 1). Based on the results, high bacterial concentrations applied will increase the degradation rate as well as shortening the distance required for pollutant removal...|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} mainly by river engineering and <b>water</b> <b>pollution</b> in densely populated regions. The species' population trend is overall stable, but is declining {{in some areas}} (Germany), while in other areas it is expanding (for example in the Danube river). In the Rhine river during the 1970s, Theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of <b>water</b> <b>pollution.</b> Subsequently, the water quality improved {{for more than two}} decades, leading to a recovery. Even so, the species became extinct in the Rhine for an unknown reason in the late 1990s. Since 2006, Theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized the Rhine, probably via ship transport through the Main-Danube Canal. An analysis based on cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene has shown that the recolonization probably originated in the Danube.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface <b>water</b> <b>pollution,</b> specifically through livestock manure production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), {{since they are}} {{sensitive}} to <b>water</b> <b>pollution,</b> and are {{large enough to be}} assessed conveniently in the field.

Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E

Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and <b>water</b> <b>pollution,</b> the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.

40|$|The {{cumulative}} impact of pollutants on water quality {{at a given}} location along a river {{is a function of}} prior loadings, as well as pollution and surface flows at that particular site. The question of whether it is possible to maintain water quality under alternative mechanisms for allocating surface <b>water</b> and <b>pollution</b> rights is addressed. We model the optimal allocation of surface <b>water</b> and <b>pollution</b> rights along a river with water quality constraints. Due to cumulative effects, the shadow values of <b>water</b> and <b>pollution</b> rights are contingent on location. It is shown that a Nash equilibrium in a market for tradable surface water rights in conjunction with a market for pollution damages implements the optimal solution. The market supports location-specific prices for both consumptive <b>water</b> rights and <b>pollution</b> damages. 2001 Academic Press 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The study investigates <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> {{impacts on}} {{urbanization}} by analyzing {{temporal and spatial}} characteristics of different water quality parameters, and simulating economic loss of <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> in Xi’an, China from 1996 to 2003. Results show that organic pollutants were the greatest contributors of surface <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> from 1996 to 2003. High values existed in petroleum concentration, chemical oxygen demand index �KMnO 4 �, biochemical oxygen demand index, and phenol concentration, followed by nitrogen concentration �TN and NH 3 -N�. From spatial analysis in different buffers from central urban area �inner buffers: 1 – 5 km; central buffers: 5 – 10 km; outer buffers: � 10 km�, socioeconomic activities such as business activities, car transportation, industry factories, agriculture practices, and households were {{likely to lead to}} different behaviors of water quality parameters in nature. Results also reveal that both surface and ground water quality improved gradually after enforcement of control measures within the 7 years from 1996 to 2003. It shows the total economic loss, including cost of water use and supply, agriculture economic loss, ecosystem conservation costs, and economic loss of human health, reached $ 1. 12 � 10 9 from 1996 to 2003, which increased $ 1. 79 � 10 7 from $ 1. 26 � 10 8 in 1996 to $ 1. 46 � 10 8 in 2003. However, economic loss of <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> increased while <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> alleviated in the past years. This can be explained by more intensive social activities in broader regions, more populations were moved from rural area into urban area, and more costs were input in <b>water</b> quality <b>pollution</b> treatment...|$|R
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface <b>water</b> <b>pollution</b> increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of <b>water</b> <b>pollution</b> in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
