5|$|Yoshimura first {{pitched the}} show to the Homicide: Life on the Street {{production}} team in May 1997 at the San Francisco production center of executive producer Barry Levinson. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer Tom Fontana, producer David Simon, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, then feeling the hum and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet. This suggestion, however, did {{not appear in the}} final episode.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Compton was out hit wicket for 184 when {{he tried}} unsuccessfully to avoid a bouncer from Miller. Fingleton {{described}} the dismissal as [...] "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always". Australia quickly finished off the hosts' innings; Miller bowled Laker for four, before England reached 441, leaving Australia with a victory target of 98 in three hours. Miller ended with 4/125 for the innings and 7/163 for the match, having removed England's two leading batsmen in both innings and bowled 63overs—more than his usual workload—because Lindwall was injured. As the players were <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pavilion after England's innings, Miller received another hostile reception. One spectator threatened him with violence, prompting the Australian to grab him by his coat collar, challenging him to enter the Australian dressing room. The spectator declined. Miller was not required to bat as Australia {{went on to win}} by eight wickets.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{performed}} [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] on all venues of {{her first}} headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. The performances of [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] set on a small platform located at the opposite end, parallel to the stage in the arena. Swift, dressed in a pastel sundress, sat on a wooden stool while performing with wooden acoustic guitar strapped to her shoulder. Swift then completed the performance standing and <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main stage. As she worked {{her way back to}} the stage, she again hugged fans, squeezed their outstretched hands and scrawled quick autographs. Nicole Frehsee of Rolling Stone favored Swift's performance of [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] at the August 27, 2009, concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Frehsee described the entire concert as an [...] "elaborate spectacle that doesn't slow down, even when the singer hauls her acoustic guitar into the audience to play a sweet, stripped down set of tunes including [...] 'Tim McGraw'." [...] Brandy McDonnel of The Oklahoman reported a massive sing-along by the audience at the March 31, 2010, concert at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City [...] Molly Trust of Billboard attended the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts and conjectured that the performance's setting was formed in order to [...] "afford a better view to fans farther back." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles did {{not attend}} Epstein's funeral, both to allow his family some privacy, and to avoid {{attracting}} fans and the media. According to Geoffrey Ellis, chief executive of NEMS Enterprises, George Harrison had given Nat Weiss, Epstein's good friend and confidant, {{the day before the}} funeral a single flower (Ellis remembers it being a chrysanthemum) wrapped in a newspaper on behalf of all four Beatles, with instructions to place the flower on Brian's coffin as a final farewell. However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials. Weiss and Ellis discussed this dilemma while <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grave, where they observed two men beginning to shovel dirt onto the casket. Ellis: [...] "Nat, who himself was Jewish, cast the newspaper package unopened onto Brian's coffin, where it was swiftly covered by earth." [...] Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool. The service at the graveside was held by Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon, who said, disparagingly, that Epstein was [...] "a symbol of the malaise of our generation". A few weeks later, on 17 October, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in St John's Wood (near Abbey Road Studios), which was officiated by Rabbi Louis Jacobs. The Bee Gees' 1968 song [...] "In the Summer of His Years" [...] was written and recorded as a tribute to Epstein.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, an [...] "unwavering groan" [...] repeated again with greater volume and accompanied by several loud thumps. When it began a third time, the men retreated to the gate entrance. They explored the wiring to the lights looking for a reason for the noises. They went back to the first cave room but heard a rumble near the entrance. <b>Walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entrance they discovered the rumble was noise from a jet. As they reached the gate, a loud, high pitched scream emanated from inside the cave. The journalists left and did not spend the night.|$|E

In the late 18th century and early to mid part of the 19th century, coal and timber was loaded onto flatboats at Westernport, where Georges Creek empties into the Potomac, then floated down to near Great Falls, Virginia, where the goods were unloaded, the boats broken up to sell as lumber, and <b>the</b> operators <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Westernport. <b>The</b> town of Piedmont, West Virginia, lies directly adjacent <b>to</b> Westernport on <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} Potomac.|$|R
2500|$|The season did {{not start}} well for Hunt. The McLaren M26 was {{problematic}} {{in the early part}} of the season, during which Niki Lauda, Mario Andretti and Jody Scheckter took a considerable lead in the Drivers' Championship. Towards the end of the year Hunt and the McLaren M26 were quicker than any rival combination other than Mario Andretti and the Lotus 78. Hunt won in Silverstone after trailing the Brabham of John Watson for 25 laps. He then took a further victory at Watkins Glen. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Hunt retired after a collision with team-mate Jochen Mass and was fined $2000 for assaulting a marshal and $750 for <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pit lane in an [...] "unsafe manner". In Fuji, Hunt won the race but did not attend the podium ceremony resulting in a fine of $20,000. He finished fifth in the World Drivers' Championship.|$|E

5000|$|The third {{movement}} has the Italian performance instructions [...] "Adagio molto e cantabile - Andante moderato - Tempo primo - Andante moderato - Adagio - Lo stesso tempo" [...] (slowly {{and with a}} singing style - moderate <b>walking</b> pace - <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first tempo - moderate <b>walking</b> pace - <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first tempo). The duration is about 16 minutes. This is a lyrical, slow movement in B major, which is a minor sixth away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a loose variation form, with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in 4/4 time, the second in 12/8. The variations are separated by passages in 3/4, the first in D major, the second in G major. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud fanfares from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth player.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a new widget and interaction technique, {{known as a}} “Frisbee, ” for interacting with areas of a large display that are difficult or impossible to access directly. A frisbee is simply a portal {{to another part of}} the display. It consists of a local &quot;telescope &quot; and a remote &quot;target&quot;. The remote data surrounded by the target is drawn in the telescope and interactions performed within it are applied on the remote data. In this paper we define the behavior of frisbees, show unique affordances of the widget, and discuss design characteristics. We have implemented a test application and report on an experiment that shows the benefit of using the frisbee on a large display.

Roberts was designated captain of the All-State team both years. Roberts played varsity ball 4 years (1931-35) at Emory & Henry College scoring 2,013 points in 104 games for a per game average of 19.4 points {{in an era when}} team scores were seldom over 30 or 35 points per game.
