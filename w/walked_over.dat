5|$|Joseph Brittan had varied {{interests}} and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch, joined others in various activities. He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch, and later helped improve the grounds and {{raised money for}} fencing the area. He was into horse racing, later bred horses, and Canterbury's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm. The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England. Joseph Brittan had a portable harmonium and as in the early years, Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch, he joined a musical group in the port town. For performances, he <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> the Bridle Path with the instrument strapped to his back. Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles.

Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about half a mile from the finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the North Koreans {{intensified}} {{their attack}} on the 2nd Battalion on the road southwest of Yongdong. Concentrated artillery support, with the shells falling {{so close to the}} 2nd Battalion positions that they wounded four US troops, together with an attack by the 2nd Battalion, briefly opened the North Korean roadblock at 04:30 July 25, and the bulk of the battalion escaped to Yongdong. However, F Company of the 8th Cavalry, the 16th Reconnaissance Company, and the 1st Platoon of A Company, 71st Tank Battalion, {{at the rear of the}} column were cut off. Only four of 11 light tanks broke through the North Korean positions. Crews abandoned the other seven tanks and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> the hills in a two days' journey as part of a group of 219 men, most of them from F Company. All equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group. Others groups of US troops escaped in the same manner. The North Koreans had flanked the 1st Cavalry Division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw. In the process, the division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2010, Diarra was {{involved}} in a controversial dispute, which resulted in the player being banned from playing league football for six matches. After receiving a yellow card booking from referee Wilfriend Bien in the team's 1–0 win over Auxerre, Diarra responded by pushing the referee with both hands. He was immediately shown a red card and dismissed from the match. After walking off the field, Diarra turned back, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to Bien and apologized for the confrontation. After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches. Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1–1 draw with Lille.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June at Ascot, Pope <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for a 200-guinea {{sweepstakes}} race.

25|$|Lea {{combined}} {{his football}} career with {{working as a}} postman – he sometimes started work at 5.30 a.m., did an 18-mile round on foot, and then caught the 9.20 train to an away match.

On his final appearance, Atlantic was beaten a short head by Minister in the Glasgow Stakes. Atlantic's performances established him as a colt of some ability, but {{he appeared to be}} some way below the best of his generation and was not considered {{to be one of the}} major contenders for the following year's Classics.|$|E
