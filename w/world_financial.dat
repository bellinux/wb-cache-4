5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient.

However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs.
