5000|$|Using {{this treaty}} as a start, he imposed his {{rule on the}} tribes of the Chelif, Miliana, and Médéa. The French high command, unhappy with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> now <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the {{unfavorable}} terms of the Desmichels Treaty, recalled General Desmichels and replaced him with General Trezel, which caused a resumption of hostilities. Abdelkader's tribal warriors met the French forces in July 1834 at the Battle of Macta, where the French suffered an unexpected defeat. France's response was to step up its pacification campaign, and under new commanders the French won several important encounters including the Battle of Sikkak. But political opinion in France was becoming ambivalent towards Algeria, and when French General Thomas Robert Bugeaud was deployed to the region in April 1837, he was [...] "authorized to use all means to induce Abd el-Kader to make overtures of peace". The result, after protracted negotiations, was the Treaty of Tafna, signed on 30 May 1837. This treaty gave even more control of interior portions of Algeria to Abdelkader, but with the recognition of France's right to imperial sovereignty. Abdelkader thus won control of all of Oran and extended his reach to the neighbouring province of Titteri and beyond.|$|R
40|$|Afterschool {{programs}} {{around the}} nation have enthusiastically embraced science, technology,engineering and math (STEM). Some major afterschool providers, like 4 -H and Girls Inc., have long mad eSTEM a priority and in recent years, {{the vast majority of}} providers have also come to value providing STEM learning opportunities as an important part of their programming. An Afterschool Alliance poll of afterschool programs conducted in 2010 - 2011 showed that 99 percent of respondents thought that offering some sort of STEM programming was important, even if that wasn't the focus of their program. As interest and commitment to STEM learning in afterschool grows, there is an increased need for support to build the capacity of afterschool programs to offer innovative and robust STEM programming. The Afterschool Alliance poll of afterschool programs also asked respondents to describe <b>what</b> supports <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> most essential. Unsurprisingly, funding was ranked as the highest need, but a close second was a desire for partnerships with STEM professionals and STEM-rich institutions, as well as more opportunities for professional development.

40|$|Abstract When {{immigrants}} move to Sweden {{from their}} native country {{it is not}} unusual that they experience some kind of identity crises. Their own experience of their cultural identity can be very problematic and they often lose a part of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> previously <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> their own identity. To handle such crises the immigrants can use different strategies. They can for example accept their disparity, deny it or emphasize it. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine how immigrants in Sweden experience that their cultural identity has changed since they moved here from a country that has a culture that is different from the Swedish culture. To reach my goal with this study I interviewed immigrants/refugees from Chile, Lebanon and Thailand. Some of the results are that my presentation of the problem and the aim with the study were not profound enough. I intended to only write about cultural identity but I came to the conclusion that individual identity and different adaptation strategies were no less important. A further conclusion is that these three ingredients are completely different things; an immigrant can have one individual identity, another cultural identity and use a strategy that does not correspond with any of these. Moreover I also found that a person’s identity does not need to change when moving from their native country to Sweden. Finally I want to stress that my study is not about making sweeping statements, it is rather exemplifying. Identity and strategies are different from one person to another. Keywords: individual identity, cultural identity, adaptation strategie...|$|R

Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} of ethnicity and friendship in a kindergarten in England. Existing literature from different traditions, such as developmental psychology, sociocultural theory and postmodernism, suggests that pre-school children tend to choose friends from the same ethnic group. The research was carried out using an ethnographic approach over the period of a year. The findings indicate that the children did play largely with others {{of the same sex}} and same ethnic origin. Children's friendships, sense of self and sense of other, it is suggested, emerged not from within but from experiences of the activities in which they did or did not engage. Hence the children's ethnic identities and friendships were shaped by the internalisation of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> and heard <b>as</b> <b>they</b> engaged in the kindergarten's activities. These led to the children's identities being performed and internalised in particular sorts of ways that marked out the children as familiar ('like us') or unfamiliar ('not like us') to others according to their previous experiences. Thus these identity performances in relation to the activities offered seemed to be internalised and to come to affect the friendships that children formed with each other. ...|$|R
50|$|After this, much of {{the white}} middle-class culture adopted a taste for this new big band music that had the {{attitude}} and authenticity of the older black music but was modified, in part, to suit the modern symphony-going listener. This started transforming into the well-known swing music. When there became a market for this particular taste, white bands started trying to appropriate the style {{for the sake of}} performance and reaching broader audiences (a testament to the growing influence and significance of the Negro music movement). Unfortunately, Baraka points out, with the explosion in popularity, the industry for recording and producing music of this kind became somewhat monopolized by wealthy white record labels and producers, and there ended up being widespread discrimination against black performers, even after the label would pay good money for the original score written by someone else. This discrimination was evident too in the subsequent alienation of many Negro listeners, who became turned off by the appropriation and new mainstream success of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt and <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> their own music.|$|R

At first, the area seemed to be deserted, but overhead, helicopter crews reported the dug in tanks of an entire Iraqi brigade. Pope received the order not to fire unless fired upon and to continue forward. Without firing a shot, Alpha Troop occupied the airfield under the guns of the defending Iraqis. The enemy forces Pope found turned out to be a group of demoralized, starving, and ragged Iraqis. Some Americans broke out their Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and shared them with the Iraqi defenders. Soon after they started eating, an Iraqi colonel marched up, furious that his men accepted American food and demanding that the Americans depart. Pope informed him that it was the Iraqis who would have to leave the area. He exchanged map information with the colonel and the Iraqi retreated back to his own lines to inform his superiors.|$|R
