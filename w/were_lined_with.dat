5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 720,594 souls; the streets <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> grass and the buildings {{on the verge of collapse}} in Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Several {{kings of}} the Middle Ages lay in state in St Paul's before their {{funerals}} at Westminster Abbey, including Richard II, Henry VI and Henry VII. In {{the case of}} Richard II, the display of his body in such a public place was to counter rumours {{that he was not}} deceased. The walls <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> the tombs of mediaeval bishops and nobility. In addition to the shrine of Erkenwald, two Anglo-Saxon kings were buried inside: Sebbi, King of the East Saxons, and Ethelred the Unready.|$|E
5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun frigate Forte. Forte, commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull and frame of a ship of the line: the frigate weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built frigate at sea. The main battery of Forte consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second frigate ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder swivel guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
50|$|The hoods of Professional Doctorates {{are made}} of red fabric lined in royal blue faille. All other {{doctorate}} hoods are in royal blue fabric distinguished by their linings. Doctorates of Philosophy <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> red faille, Honorary Doctorates <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin, Honorary Doctorates honoris causa <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin with an edging strip in gold, and Honorary Doctors of the University have hoods <b>lined</b> entirely <b>with</b> gold satin.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the restaurant building is an open space similar to the retail building but larger in scale. The steel portal frame is exposed {{on the inside and}} ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> bamboo. The northern side of the space has been fitted with servery counters and kitchen rooms. The floor <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carpet. The steel columns <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> plasterboard and painted. Air conditioning vents, ceiling fans and pendant lights are suspended from the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carpet. Internal doors are panelled timber. Cornices and picture rails are simply detailed and formed from timber.|$|R
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (brought in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for woodworking and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian serving, cleaning and kitchen women.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} walls and ceilings of the observatory building <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibre-cement sheeting with timber cover strips. Internal doors are timber joinery {{and the floor}} has <b>been</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> linoleum. Some half-height walls and counters open on to the enclosed verandahs.|$|R
50|$|The street <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> stone pines.|$|R
50|$|The northern, rear {{facade of}} the building, <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a modern steel framed {{verandah}} which {{is linked to the}} rear verandahs of the adjacent buildings on the site. This facade <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> early timber framed window openings and early doors, with some more recent penetrations.|$|R
5|$|The fortifications {{had only}} {{relatively}} thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> many tall towers for archers, {{but could not}} be used to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour. On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary"), and now as the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates. However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them.|$|E
5|$|With the {{ambition}} to become London's sole burial site in perpetuity, the LNC {{were aware that}} if their plans were successful, their Necropolis would become a site of major national importance. As a consequence, the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind, {{in contrast to the}} squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded. The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in the cemetery, and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly. It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil. Robert Donald, the owner of an arboretum near Woking, was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery. The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. As well as the giant sequoias, the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia, rhododendron, coastal redwood, azalea, andromeda and monkeypuzzle, with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The roads <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> {{trees and}} streetlights. The {{electrical}} lines were run underground, meaning {{that there was}} no need for utility poles to be raised.|$|E
50|$|Cane Creek <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> cane, {{hence the}} name.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> {{restaurants}} and shops.|$|R
50|$|Brush Lake {{originally}} <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> brush, {{hence the}} name.|$|R
25|$|Numerous tunnels were {{excavated}} as {{shelters and}} to store ammunition and food. A few were completed, some abandoned. Few <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> concrete before materials became scarce {{and the workers}} left the Island.|$|E
25|$|When the garret room he {{occupied}} for {{the last}} {{three and a half years}} of his life was examined after his death, the walls <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> stacks of fruit crates containing his extensive library and most of the floor was covered with packing crates full of most of a lifetime's artistic output.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1762, the Commission of Stone Buildings of Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{ruled that}} no {{structure}} in the city can be higher than the Winter Palace and prohibited spacing between buildings. During the reign of Catherine the Great in the 1760s–1780s, {{the banks of the}} Neva <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> granite embankments.|$|E
50|$|Both {{sides of}} the creek <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> {{saltwater}} marshland.|$|R

25|$|Used {{to process}} salt, salt pans were large, ovular, shallow clay pans that could hold from 10 to 26 liters. A heavy slip {{made them more}} waterproof. They were most likely formed from a mold, {{possibly}} a basket. They <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> grass or textiles to keep from sticking to each other or the mold before firing.|$|E
25|$|In 1782, {{work on the}} Great Siege Tunnels started. The tunnels {{became a}} great and complex system of {{underground}} fortifications which nowadays criss-crosses {{the inside of the}} Rock. Once the Siege was over, the fortifications were rebuilt and, in the following century, the walls <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> Portland limestone. Such stone gave the walls their present white appearance.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Surrey Street in Nundah {{became the}} site of the first public housing {{dwelling}} in Queensland. In the early twentieth century, Nundah became a major suburban centre, due to its location on Sandgate Road, one of Brisbane's busiest arterial roads, and the adjacent Nundah railway station. Sandgate Road and nearby streets <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> shops, pubs, cinemas and other commercial premises.|$|E
50|$|Lark Lane <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> pubs, {{restaurants}} and specialist shops.|$|R
50|$|Pole Creek <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> pole-shaped trees, {{hence the}} name.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{walls of the}} church <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> horizontal tongue and groove boarding. The floor is of ironbark. The flat ceiling <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> timber boards. The altar recess on {{the eastern end of}} the building has a lower ceiling which has truncated corners, reflecting the pitch of the external gabled projection.|$|R
25|$|From 1971, Lampeter awarded University of Wales degrees, and as such, the {{academic}} dress {{was that of}} the University of Wales — graduates wore a black stuff gown, with bell sleeves for bachelors, and glove sleeve for masters. Hoods <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> mazarin blue shot green (arts), mazarin blue shot red (divinity), lined yellow shot black (MSc) and yellow shot red, bound light blue (MBA).|$|E
25|$|Early residences {{outside of}} the forts, still mostly wood structures, were built along the modern street grid on early lots sold to settlers, but have all been {{demolished}} over time. What became the almost entirely office and parking-lot dominated downtown still had many solidly single family residential blocks on its fringes up until the early 20th century. Streets near Broadway, such as Chestnut, <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> large mansions of the owners of businesses on Main and Market streets.|$|E
25|$|The last {{neighbourhood}} {{to be built}} was the Äussere Neustadt (Outer New City), which added a {{third and}} final layer to Bern's defences starting in 1343. All of these walls, gates and earthworks were demolished {{in the nineteenth century}} ending with the destruction of Bern's greatest of its three guard towers, the Christoffelturm. Only the four central streets <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> residential houses in late medieval times, {{while the rest of the}} area was devoted to agriculture and animal husbandry.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} streets <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> many {{retail stores}} and restaurants.|$|R
