2500|$|After {{the team}} fights the Hecatomb and Rogue suffers a severe mental injury, the team decide {{to rest in}} Rogue's {{childhood}} home, but are betrayed and attacked by the Marauders who are {{on a mission to}} retrieve Destiny's Diaries. It was revealed that Mystique is an accomplice of the Marauders. After the surprise blitz, Emma Frost (who was trying to help Rogue) was disabled by a neurotoxin, but was able to upload everything she picked out of what was {{at the edges of the}} Marauders' psi-shielding into Sam's mind and takes limited possession over his body, causing him to flee (unwillingly) from the battle with Iceman. Aboard the Blackbird, the two are engaged in midair by Sunfire, who cripples the jet. Cannonball manages to escape and battle Shiro, who reveals that he killed Cable. Cannonball shakes it off, explaining that it [...] "wouldn't matter <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> ah'd still be sayin' 'show me the body.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clark often {{expressed}} {{pleasure at}} the flogging of convicts, although rarely performed the punishment himself. After one incident, {{in which a}} particularly troublesome female convict, Elizbaeth Dudgeon, was punished for insulting a guard officer, he noted [...] "she has long been fishing for it, which she has at last got to her heart's content". He did, however, occasionally empathise with the convicts, especially when they were mistreated. Shortly after landing on Norfolk Island, Clark and Robert Kellow came across some convicts, including some women with their children, who {{had been forced to}} sleep in the open far from the main townsite, adequate accommodation being lacking: [...] "on the Road we met a great many of the Convicts both Men and Women Particular the women that have young children <b>Who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the have been obliged to Sleep in the woods all night for the could not get into Town, poor Devils how they are Kick about from one place to a nother". Unusually for the time, Clark was effectively a teetotaller, preferring to drink only lemonade. He often privately chastised his fellow officers' drinking habits, boasting in his diary that he had only been intoxicated once—at his wedding.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told him that I was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I could do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E
2500|$|Due to a {{widespread}} practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, {{most of the}} destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he [...] "was stopped by a fireman <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… {{they were told that}} they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city." [...] Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and un-reinforced concrete are resistance to fire but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.|$|E

60|$|I made no answer, since {{what was}} the use of arguing with a woman <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> frankly <b>that</b> all she said was false.

6000|$|Perhaps; but {{apart from}} the papers I have seen people who were out and <b>who</b> have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you rode with {{absolute}} recklessness, simply and purely for a fall, and that you deserved to break your neck a dozen times over.
