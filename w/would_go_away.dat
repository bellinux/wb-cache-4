5|$|His neck {{continued}} to cause him pain, and Prince Philip commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

25|$|The chapel of the Señora del Rosario is {{one that}} marks the town’s {{traditional}} western boundary and lends {{its name to the}} surrounding neighborhood. It has an east-west orientation and is paired with the chapel of Santiago {{on the east side of}} town. It is adorned with stucco filigree, with seven niches in the body and three in the bell areas. It used to be said that when the bells of this chapel sounded, hunger <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Festival of the Señora del Rosaio is 7 October, with toritos de luces (small bull shaped frames with fireworks), festival and wind bands.|$|E

25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was too embarrassed to tell his mother about the injury and hoped it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of his 1990 projects, Henson traveled continuously. [...] By late Spring, Henson began to experience recurring flu-like symptoms. On May 4, 1990, Henson appeared with Kermit on The Arsenio Hall Show, {{one of his last}} television appearances. At the time, he mentioned to his publicist that he was tired and had a sore throat, but felt that it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their lessons}} on black self-reliance, the Malloys never spoke with Sanders about racism. Looking back in 1995, Shabazz wrote: [...] "Race {{relations}} were not discussed {{and it was}} hoped that by denying the existence of race problems, the problems <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Anyone who openly discussed race relations was quickly viewed as a 'troublemaker.'" [...] Still, two race riots during her childhood—in 1942 when the Sojourner Truth housing project was desegregated, and one the following year on Belle Isle—made up what Shabazz later called the [...] "psychological background for my formative years".|$|E

500|$|During Blackadder Rides Again, Tony Robinson {{likewise}} {{recalls that}} these script meetings could be uncomfortable, {{and has been}} less reserved speaking about the script rehearsals since. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial [...] "There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers—the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At {{end of the first}} day of rehearsals the writers <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> {{and by the time they}} came back we would have changed an awful lot of it. By the end, they felt we had run away with it. There were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that." ...|$|E
500|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} 1877, the Conservatives were {{confident}} and the Liberals defensive. After the Tories {{had a successful}} session {{in the early part}} of the year, another series of picnics commenced in a wide belt around Toronto. Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier. More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the [...] "National Policy": high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railroad, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada. These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted—at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> if the Conservatives were elected.|$|E
500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and {{that many of our}} big problems and scandals <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> if everyone could just relax and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} league season away at Plough Lane, where they faced Wimbledon on 27 August 1988. The team started badly, going a goal behind after eight minutes but {{came back to}} win 5–1 with Alan Smith scoring a hat-trick. The manner of Arsenal’s {{comeback}} had journalist Dennis Signy mulling over the club's chances of winning the league; {{he wrote in his}} Times match report: [...] "…the Gunners made the bookmakers' odds of 16–1 against them for the championship look generous." [...] At Highbury, Arsenal were beaten by newly promoted Aston Villa; for much of the first half Graham’s side struggled to break through Villa's back five. The visitors were two goals up in the match before Arsenal equalised in the space of ten minutes. [...] Andy Gray scored the winner in the 62nd minute from a free-kick contentiously awarded by the referee. Arsenal then faced Tottenham Hotspur in the season’s first North London Derby, staged at White Hart Lane. A fast-paced and open first-half saw five goals in 17 minutes with Arsenal running out 3–2 winners. Graham later described it a “great” and “wonderful advertisement for the game," [...] and felt the supporters and media <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> happy. Arsenal's home form continued to blight them as the team dropped two points against Southampton on 17 September 1988. The match was best remembered for an altercation between Paul Davis and Glenn Cockerill. The Arsenal midfielder punched Cockerill which was missed by the referee, but caught on camera. Davis was later banned for nine matches and handed a record £3,000 ﬁne. Arsenal ended the month with a 2–1 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday and sat in seventh position.|$|E
2500|$|Ghada Karmi and Eugene Cotran {{interpret}} the phrase {{as part of}} a deliberate ignoring, not expressing a lack of awareness of the existence of Palestinian Arabs on the part of Zionists and, later, Israelis, but, rather, the fact that Zionists and Israelis preferred to pretend that Palestinian Arabs did not exist and the fact that Jews wished they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Nur Masalha, contributing to an edited collection by Ghada Karmi and Eugene Cotran, cites Israel's leading satirist Dan Ben-Amotz, who observed that ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, The Today Show co-host Bryant Gumbel {{wrote an}} {{internal}} memo {{critical of the}} show's personalities, a memo that was later leaked to the media. In the memo, Gumbel said Scott [...] "holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste…This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him in." [...] This garnered enough of a backlash {{that the next time}} they appeared on camera together Scott kissed Gumbel on the cheek to show he'd forgiven him, and also later said he hoped the whole thing <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Anglo-Saxon silver pennies {{were the}} {{currency}} used to pay the Danegeld, essentially protection money paid to the Vikings so that they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and not ravage the land. As an illustration of how heavy a burden the Danegeld was, more Anglo-Saxon pennies from the decades around the first millennium {{have been found in}} Denmark than in England. In the reign of Ethelred the Unready (978–1016), some 40 million pennies were paid to the Danes, while King Canute (Knut) (1016–1035) paid off his invasion army with another 20 million pennies. This adds up to about [...] of silver, equivalent to £250,000 at the time, and worth about £10 million in [...] money (its purchasing power at that time may have exceeded £100 million and may have been as high as £1 billion in 2005).|$|E
