25|$|For {{several centuries}} Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, {{has been known}} as the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the {{presence}} of many of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul Bocuse). This reputation also {{comes from the fact that}} two of France's best known <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> are located near Lyon: the Beaujolais to the North, and the Côtes du Rhône to the South. Beaujolais wine is very popular in Lyon and remains the most common table wine served with local dishes.|$|E
25|$|This is {{wine from}} one of the 13 <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> (Anbaugebiete), and the region must be shown on the label. It is a basic level of everyday, mostly {{inexpensive}} quaffing wines. The grapes are at a fairly low level of ripeness, with must weights of 51°Oe to 72°Oe. The alcohol content of the wine must be at least 7% by volume, and chaptalization (adding sugar to the unfermented grape juice to boost the final alcohol level, which in no way alters the sweetness) is often used. QbA range from dry to semi-sweet, and the style is often indicated on the label, along with the designation Qualitätswein and the region. Some top-level dry wines are officially QbA although they would qualify as Prädikatswein.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the {{expanding}} wine industries of California, Australia and Israel were greatly enhanced by advances in irrigation. With {{the development of}} more cost efficient and less labor-intensive ways of watering the vines, vast tracts of very sunny but dry lands were able to be converted into <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions.</b> The ability to control the precise amount of water each vine received, allowed producers in these New World wine regions to develop styles of wines that could be fairly consistent each year regardless of normal vintage variation. This created a stark contrast to the Old World wine regions of Europe where vintage variation, including rainfall, had a pronounced effect on the potential wine style each year. Continuing research explored the way that controlled (or supplemental) irrigation could be used to increase potential wine quality by influencing how the grapevine responds to its environment and funnels resources into developing the sugars, acids and phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine's quality. This research lead to the development of ways to measure the amount of water retention in the soil, so that individual irrigation regimes could be plotted for each vineyard that maximized the benefits of water management.|$|E

500|$|The Rogue Valley AVA {{includes}} the drainage basin of the Rogue River and several tributaries, including the Illinois River, the Applegate River, and Bear Creek. Most wineries {{in the region}} are found along one of these three tributaries, rather than along the Rogue River itself. The region is [...] wide by [...] long (although much of the land within the AVA is not suitable for grape cultivation); there are currently 32 wineries with only [...] planted. The three valleys differ greatly in terroir, with the easternmost Bear Creek valley being warmest and driest, and the westernmost Illinois River valley being coolest and wettest. Each river valley has a unique climate and grows different varieties of grapes. Overall, however, this region is the warmest and driest of Oregon's <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions.</b> The region has one sub-AVA, the Applegate Valley AVA.|$|E
2500|$|Translated as [...] "quality {{wine with}} {{specific}} attributes", {{this is the}} top level of German wines. [...] These prominently display a Prädikat (ripeness level designation) on the label {{and may not be}} chaptalized. Prädikatswein range from dry to intensely sweet, but unless it is specifically indicated that the wine is dry or off-dry, these wines always contain a noticeable amount of residual sugar. Prädikatswein must be produced from allowed varieties in one of the 39 subregions (Bereich) of one of the 13 <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions,</b> although it is the region rather than the subregion which is mandatory information on the label. (Some of the smaller regions, such as Rheingau, consist of only one subregion.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Roussanne is a {{white wine}} grape grown {{originally}} in the Rhône wine region in France, where it is often blended with Marsanne. It is the only other white variety, besides Marsanne, allowed in the northern Rhône appellations of Crozes-Hermitage AOC, Hermitage AOC and Saint-Joseph AOC. [...] In the southern Rhône appellation of Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC {{it is one of}} six white grapes allowed, along with Grenache blanc, Piquepoul blanc, Clairette, Bourboulenc and Picardan. The Châteauneuf-du-Pape appellation also allows it to be blended into red wines. The grape is also planted in various <b>wine-growing</b> <b>regions</b> of the New World, such as California, Washington, Texas and Australia as well as European regions such as Crete, Tuscany and Spain.|$|E
50|$|Today Slovenia {{has more}} than 28,000 wineries making between 80 and 90 million litres {{annually}} from the country's 22,300 ha of vineyards. About 75% of the country's production is white wine. Almost all of the wine is consumed domestically with only 6.1 million l a year being exported - mostly to the United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and lately the Czech Republic. Most of the country's wine production falls under the classification of premium (vrhunsko) wine with less than 30% classified as basic table wine (namizno vino). Slovenia has three principal wine regions: the Drava <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region,</b> the Lower Sava <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region,</b> and the Littoral <b>Wine-growing</b> <b>Region.</b>|$|R
