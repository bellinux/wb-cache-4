40|$|Subject of investigation: {{process of}} sawing of <b>wood</b> {{particle}} <b>boards</b> by circular saws. Purpose of the work: substantiation of the rational {{parameters of the}} circular saw teeth and sawing conditions. The theoretical results include the study and determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of the process of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics of the sawing conditions on the geometry of the saw teeth; development of a mathematical model for sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The work substantiates the rational parameters of circular saw teeth and the conditions of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality of the sawn surface. The rational parameters are substantiated for the circular saws and for the conditions of sawing of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The use of the improved circular saws and sawing conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of <b>wood</b> particle <b>boards,</b> to reduce power consumption in sawing and to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
