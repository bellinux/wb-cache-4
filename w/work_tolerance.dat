40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the personality variables morningness, flexibility, languidity and hardiness could predict sleep-related shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the day, evening and night shifts, respectively. Design: Prospective study design with questionnaires administered in winter 2008 / 2009 (wave 1) and 2 years later in spring 2011 (wave 3). Setting: Different healthcare institutions in Norway. Participants: The sample comprised in all 700 nurses working a three-shift rotating schedule. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The personality variables were assessed at wave 1, as were the demographic, lifestyle and work-related variables. Sleep-related shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance,</b> assessed at wave 3, was measured separately for the day, evening and night shifts with the Bergen Shift Work Sleep Questionnaire. Results: Morningness was positively associated with sleep-related day shift tolerance (p< 0. 001). Flexibility was positively associated with sleep-related tolerance for the evening as well as night shift (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, languidity was negatively associated with sleep-related shift tolerance for the day, evening and night shifts (p< 0. 001, < 0. 01, < 0. 05, respectively). Hardiness was positively associated with sleep-related tolerance for the day, evening and night shifts (p< 0. 001, < 0. 01, < 0. 05, respectively). Age was negatively associated with sleeprelated shift tolerance for the day, night (p< 0. 01) and evening shifts (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: The findings indicate that hardiness and languidity predict sleep-related shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> across all shift types among shift working nurses. The effects of flexibility and morningness seem to depend on the shift schedule. By and large, our results are in accordance with previous studies; however, we have now demonstrated the prospective importance of personality in relation to sleep-related shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> across different shifts. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A {{commercial}} chemical, biological, radiological {{and nuclear}} (CBRN) protective covert garment {{has recently been}} developed {{with the aim of}} reducing thermal strain. A covert CBRN protective layer can be worn under other clothing, with equipment added for full chemical protection when needed. However, it is unknown whether the covert garment offers any alleviation to thermal strain during work compared with a traditional overt ensemble. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare thermal strain and <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> times during work in an overt and covert ensemble offering the same level of CBRN protection. Methods: Eleven male participants wore an overt (OVERT) or covert (COVERT) CBRN ensemble and walked (4 km·h− 1, 1 % grade) for a maximum of 120 min in either a wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT] of 21, 30, or 37 °C (Neutral, WarmWet and HotDry, respectively). The trials were ceased if the participants' gastrointestinal temperature reached 39 °C, heart rate reached 90 % of maximum, walking time reached 120 min or due to self-termination. Results: All participants completed 120 min of walking in Neutral. <b>Work</b> <b>tolerance</b> time was greater in OVERT compared with COVERT in WarmWet (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Those dressed in OVERT experienced lower thermal strain and longer <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> times compared with COVERT in a warm-wet environment.

30|$|Recent <b>works</b> on <b>tolerancing</b> include {{tolerance}} analysis simulation {{during the}} initial design phase by a computer-aided tolerancing software (Barbero et al. 2015). The design tolerances estimated through this simulation subsequently determine the manufacturing tolerances. In another approach, complex workpiece with intricate shapes are classified based on its overall discrete geometry and tolerance analysis is performed on this overall part geometry (Schleich and Wartzack 2014). This simplifies the tolerance analysis for non-ideal complex workpiece shapes. Louhichi et al. (2015) performed realistic part tolerancing taking CAD part geometrical discrepancies into consideration. They identified the future research <b>work</b> as <b>tolerance</b> allocation by taking the manufacturing variations into consideration, which is also addressed in this paper. Considering this literature review, it can be summarized that the <b>works</b> on process <b>tolerancing</b> concentrated on the aspects of tolerance synthesis through tolerance chain and tolerance charting. In the pursuit for striking the balance between the conflicting issues of quality and cost, part tolerancing is optimized keeping the manufacturing process into consideration.|$|R

40|$|Background. Shift work is {{associated}} with sleep and health problems. Tolerance to shift work is reported to decrease with age. Shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{should be considered in}} different shift work populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between age, shift work exposure, shift type, and morningness and sleep/health problems in oil rig shift workers. Material and methods. A total of 199 workers participated. They worked either two weeks of 12 -h day shifts (n = 96) or two weeks of swing shifts (n = 103) (one week of 12 -h night shifts followed by one week of 12 -h day shifts), followed by four weeks off work. The workers filled out questionnaires on demographics, work, sleep, and health. Results. We found no significant associations between age or years of shift work exposure and any of the sleep, sleepiness, or health parameters. There was a significant association between shift type and sleep duration, showing that swing shift workers had longer sleep duration than day shift workers. In addition, we found a significant association between the interaction age*, shift type, and sleep duration, where sleep duration was negatively associated with age for the swing shift workers and positively associated with age for the day shift workers. There were significant associations between morningness and sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and insomnia. Conclusions. Older workers may tolerate shift work well. Age, shift work exposure time, and shift type seemed not to affect shift <b>work</b> <b>tolerance</b> in this population. However, this may be due to a healthy worker effect and/or selection bias. </p...|$|E

Skylab 4 results indicated that the most likely cause of increased blood flow was an increase in cardiac output secondary to increased central venous pressure caused by blood redistribution. Changes in venous compliance are thought to be primarily changes in somatic musculature which is postulated to primarily determine venous compliance of the legs. This was also thought to be demonstrated by the changes in muscle pumping.
