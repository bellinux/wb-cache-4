5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the Shetland <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as {{threatened}} by cross-breeding, leading {{to a decline in}} wool quality. To combat this, the Shetland Flock Book Society was formed in 1927, and this remains the body responsible for the sheep's protection on their native islands.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as an imminent Confederate attack. Many of the makeshift trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Pinto {{was made}} a {{spokeswoman}} for L'Oréal Paris. Two years later, a controversy arose when she appeared in an advert promoting a L'Oréal product; it showed Pinto in what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to be a lighter skin tone due to make-up or editing. The company denied claims of retouching Pinto's picture.|$|E
50|$|Theories on emotion {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived,</b> how emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> somatically, and at what stage of an event emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
50|$|This {{suggests}} that for sound to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> at 7-8 Hz, the 7-8 Hz SPL {{would have to}} be 12.3 dB higher than the 92.0 dB SPL required at 15.5 Hz, which means that the 7-8 Hz SPL would require at least 104 dB of SPL to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b> For 3 Hz to <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> the SPL would need to add another 12.3 dB, or reach 116 dB of SPL, to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> as sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Ahbash and Hezbollah {{members were}} {{involved}} in a street battle which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to be over parking issues, both groups later met to form a joint compensation fund for the victims of the conflict.

5|$|Most {{of these}} techniques, {{particularly}} paraphrase and parody, became standardized {{during the first}} half of the 16th century; Josquin was very much a pioneer, and what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> by later observers as the mixing of these techniques was actually the process by which they were created.|$|E
25|$|In addition, male {{speakers}} who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as gay exhibited greater breathiness and hyperarticulation of stressed syllables {{than male}} speakers who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as heterosexual.

50|$|If the lag between {{consecutive}} presentations {{is prolonged}} further, ('beta' / 'optimal') motion <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> The line in position A <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to move to}} position B. In the original experiments of Wertheimer (1912), a lag of 60 ms {{was found to be}} optimal to obtain this kind of percept. If the lag is further prolonged, two forms of partial movement can be perceived: dual movement and singular movement. In dual movement, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> that both move, but not in a continuous way (like from A to B). In singular motion, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> of which only one is moving. Finally, from a lag of around 200 ms in the original study onwards, the two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to occur in succession—first A, then B.|$|R

5|$|The {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as {{a decisive}} Israeli victory, causing reorganizations in the Syrian high command {{and the birth}} of heroic tales in Israel. However, Syria made a small territorial gain and certain actions were criticized within Israel, such as the retreat from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian {{adopted a}} policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (fines) were marked, and the frontiers (limites) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian's Wall, which separated the Roman world from what <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.|$|E
5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, {{was seen as a}} rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{substance}} was famously critiqued by David Hume, who held that since substance cannot <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> {{it should not}} be assumed to exist. But the claim that substance cannot <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>is</b> neither clear nor obvious, and neither is the implication obvious.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{instructors}} who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to have credibility is {{typically associated with}} effective teaching skills. Instructors who demonstrate competence, character, and/or caring <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to engage in a}} variety of effective instructional communication behaviors such as argumentativeness, verbal and nonverbal immediacy, affinity seeking [...], and assertiveness and responsiveness. Moreover, credible instructors <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> low in verbal aggressiveness [...] and less likely to use behaviors that interfere with student learning.|$|R

5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> {{as a way of}} lessening the amount of work needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> by {{the public}} {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the more {{numerous}} Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have often}} used the {{opposition}} between Rome and Egypt in Antony and Cleopatra to set forth defining {{characteristics of the}} various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral. Critic James Hirsh has stated that, [...] "as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from a Roman point of view; Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> form a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view." ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether students at two universities perceive social power differences {{between male and}} female business faculty. Using gender schema and social power theories, we posit that female faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater referent power and that male faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater expert, legitimate, reward and coercive power. Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power. Contrary to our hypotheses, female faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater legitimate power...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E

5|$|However, the Cabildo {{appointed}} a Junta headed by Cisneros, who {{would stay in}} power, even if under a new office. Saavedra was appointed to this Junta, as well as Castelli and two peninsulars.
