5|$|Development {{for a third}} {{movie was}} {{announced}} in 2009, with Dan Lin as the producer. Lin intends to reboot the film series with a young Croft in an origin story. In 2011, Olivia Wilde denied rumours that she would play the role, but still expressed interest. The film, originally meant for a 2013 release, is to be produced by Graham King, written by Marti Noxon and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in partnership with King's studio GK Films. On 28 April 2016, {{it was announced that}} Alicia Vikander <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> Lara in the next film adaptation.|$|E

The band announced in April 2012 that Bill Stevenson, who had previously worked with NOFX and Rise Against, would be the producer for their sixth album.|$|E
50|$|On March 5, 2013, the 2013 {{schedule}} was released, revealing that {{eight of the}} regular season games <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in Guelph and one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in Moncton, New Brunswick as part of Touchdown Atlantic. When the Tiger-Cats clinched a home game in the 2013 playoffs, the team announced that that game <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in Guelph.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 it was {{suggested}} that the 2017 Series could be expanded to 8 teams. Two games <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in Australia and two <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in the UK with the World Club Challenge alternating each year.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{in early}} December, [...] "Stargazers" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> {{following}} [...] "Passion and the Opera", and [...] "Sacrament of Wilderness" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> between [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] and [...] "Know Why the Nightingale Sings".|$|R
5|$|After {{a couple}} of months pondering his future career plans, he {{received}} a telephone call from the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve its image. Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing.</b> This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E
5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a {{round robin}} tournament. The teams {{with the top}} three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals. Finland had {{finished}} their schedule with a 5–1–1 record to lead the tournament. Canada entered {{the game with a}} 4–1–1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by more than four goals would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers expected {{at least one of the}} teams <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> for the gold medal.|$|E
50|$|The final <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> on a home-and-away two-legged basis, {{with the}} higher-seeded team hosting the second leg. If tied on aggregate, the away goals rule <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> used, and 30 minutes of extra time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played.</b> If still tied after extra time, the penalty {{shoot-out}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{used to determine}} the winner.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2013, it was {{announced}} that the 2014 through 2018 NCAA Division II Football Championships <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> at Children's Mercy Park, moving from Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence, Alabama. It was also announced that the 2015 NCAA College Cup <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> at Children's Mercy Park.|$|R

5|$|In late August and September 2008, while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect, {{he began}} making hints that The Get Up Kids would be reuniting {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of the band's second album Something to Write Home About. The reunion was finally {{confirmed}} by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star, confirming rumors that the band <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{old wooden}} {{roof of the}} stand was due to be {{replaced}} {{the day after the}} Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the team <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6million to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take over in the summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{after the}} 9/11 attacks, both the National Football League and Major League Baseball {{canceled}} their upcoming games for a week. As a result, the World Series <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in November {{for the first}} time and the Super Bowl <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> in February {{for the first time}}.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the score}} was tied after the four rapid tie break games, colors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> drawn and two blitz games (5 minutes plus 10 seconds {{increment}} per move) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played.</b> If {{the score was}} tied after two blitz games, another two-game blitz match <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played,</b> under the same terms. The process would repeat, if necessary, until five blitz matches have <b>been</b> <b>played.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1982, as a Third Division side, Oxford United faced closure {{because of}} the club's {{inability}} to service the debts owed to Barclays Bank, but were rescued when businessman Robert Maxwell took over the club. In April 1983, Maxwell proposed merging United with neighbours Reading, {{to form a new}} club called the Thames Valley Royals, to play at Didcot. Jim Smith would have managed the club and been assisted by Reading boss Maurice Evans. The merger was called off as a result of fans of both clubs protesting against the decision. Furthermore, the Reading chairman stepped down and was replaced by an opponent of the merger. Maxwell also threatened to fold the club if the merger did not go through. Oxford won the Third Division title after the 1983–84 season under the management of Jim Smith, who also guided them to the Second Division title the following year. This meant that Oxford United <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> First Division football in the 1985–86 season, 23 years after joining the Football League. Smith moved to Queens Park Rangers shortly after the promotion success, and made way for chief scout Maurice Evans, who, several seasons earlier, had won the Fourth Division title with Reading.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo did {{not play}} in the third group stage match against hosts Brazil, as he had come down with a minor injury {{at the end of}} the second match, {{although}} he would be available to play for the semi-finals. Italy were defeated 4–2 in the final group stage match on 22 June, which meant that they finished second in group A, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> the winners of group B, tournament favourites Spain, in a rematch of the European Championship Final of the previous year. Italy held Spain to 0–0 draw on 27 June, as the match eventually went to penalties. Pirlo netted his penalty, but Bonucci's miss allowed Spain to advance to the final, as Italy lost the shootout 7–6. Pirlo was injured for the third place final, although Italy managed to defeat Uruguay 3–2 on penalties on 30 June, after a 2–2 draw. Pirlo was named to the Team of the Tournament, and was nominated for the Golden Ball award, although he failed to place amongst the top three players of the tournament, as the awards went to Neymar, Iniesta, and Paulinho, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Daniel Brühl {{joined the}} cast in an {{unspecified}} role, while Anthony Mackie and Frank Grillo were confirmed to return as Sam Wilson / Falcon and Brock Rumlow / Crossbones, respectively. Following the November 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, emails between Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released stating that Marvel wanted to include Spider-Man (whose film rights are licensed to Sony) in the film, but {{talks between the}} studios concerning this were believed to have broken down. However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios reached a licensing deal {{for the use of}} Spider-Man in an MCU film, and reports indicated that the character would indeed appear in Civil War. The Russos stated they were lobbying for months to include the character in the film. In January 2015, Mackie revealed that, in addition to Atlanta, filming locations would include Puerto Rico and Berlin, while the Russo brothers confirmed that Scarlett Johansson would return in the film as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow. Editor Jeffrey Ford, who worked on The Winter Soldier, also signed on for Civil War. In March 2015, Jeremy Renner was revealed to be reprising his role as Clint Barton / Hawkeye. The next month, it was revealed that the film would be converted to 3D in post-production, and that Brühl <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> Helmut Zemo. Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen revealed she would reprise her role in the film as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch.|$|E
50|$|In the {{knockout}} stage, if a {{match was}} level {{at the end}} of normal playing time, extra time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner, except for the third place match where no extra time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played.</b>|$|R
50|$|If a {{match was}} tied after normal playing time, 30 minutes of extra time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played.</b> If still tied after extra time, a penalty shootout <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held to {{determine}} the winner. However, for the fifth-place and third-place matches, no extra time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>played,</b> and if tied the match would go straight to a penalty shootout {{to determine the}} winner.|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
