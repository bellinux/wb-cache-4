Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro's political and religious leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty. He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann's flying {{career began}} {{when he joined the}} glider {{training}} program of the fledgling Luftwaffe and <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> fly by his mother, one of the first female glider pilots in Germany. The Hartmanns also owned a light aircraft but were forced to sell it in 1932 as the German economy collapsed. The rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 resulted in government support for gliding, and, in 1936, Elisabeth Hartmann established the glider club in Weil im Schönbuch in 1936 for locals and served as instructress. The 14-year-old Hartmann became an instructor. In 1939, he gained his pilot's license, allowing him to fly powered aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the war, the {{artillery}} worked independently and <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> support the infantry {{to ensure a}} successful attack. In 1914, the heaviest artillery gun was the 60-pounder, four in each heavy battery. The Royal Horse Artillery employed the 13-pounder, while the Royal Field Artillery used the 18-pounder gun. By 1918, the situation had changed; {{the artillery}} were the dominant force on the battlefield. Between 1914 and 1918, the Royal Field Artillery had increased from 45 field brigades to 173 field brigades, while the heavy and siege artillery of the Royal Garrison Artillery had increased from 32 heavy and six siege batteries to 117 heavy and 401 siege batteries.|$|E
5|$|Charles Heaphy {{was born}} {{sometime}} in 1820 in London, England. He {{was the youngest}} child of Thomas Heaphy, who was a professional painter and three of his siblings also became noted painters. His grandfather John Gerrard Heaphy was a merchant from Ireland. The family lived in St John's Wood in north-west London and enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class existence although his mother died sometime during his early childhood. Thomas earned painting commissions from high society and in 1812 accompanied Arthur Wellesley, who was later to become the Duke of Wellington, as staff artist during the Peninsular War. Thomas died in 1835 and left the entire estate to his second wife, who he had married in 1833. Charles, who had obtained work as a draughtsman at the London & Birmingham Railway Company, {{moved out of the}} family home soon after. As a child, Charles <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> paint by his father and in December 1837, sponsored by a family friend, he entered the Royal Academy school of painting.

5|$|During the Contact period, it {{is known}} that certain {{military}} positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Kenyatta {{left home}} and {{enrolled}} as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> read and write in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in {{which most of the}} British missionaries treated them.|$|E
5|$|Matilda had a younger, {{legitimate}} brother, William Adelin, and her father's {{relationships with}} numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings. Little {{is known about}} Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> read, and was educated in religious morals. Among the nobles at her mother's court were her uncle David, later the King of Scotland, and aspiring nobles such as her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, her cousin Stephen of Blois and Brian Fitz Count. In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother {{in the care of}} Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother. There is no detailed description of Matilda's appearance; contemporaries described Matilda as being very beautiful, but this may have simply reflected the conventional practice among the chroniclers.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Born in Temora, New South Wales, {{near the}} {{regional}} centre of Wagga Wagga, Kerry {{was one of}} two sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. Kerry <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke. Kerry grew up participating {{in a wide range of}} sports, representing Wollongong High School in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of Wollongong, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much more exciting due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooperwho went on to win the 400m freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympicswas living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the following year. At the time of his move, Kerry was ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the story, the mother-daughter {{relationship}} between Hilde and Erika is complex. The first point of {{tension between the}} women is the generation difference.

Erika is taught to be active and bold; Hilde <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> be passive and demure. There is much misunderstanding from the differences in their ages and histories. Also, Hilde is extremely envious of Erika's education and opportunities, causing a rift between mother and daughter.

50|$|The oral {{tradition}} is not dead. In schools {{or at home}} or in the street, where children <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> learn by heart, to memorize, nursery rhymes or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the {{oral tradition}}. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of the ages of man (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child <b>is</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.|$|R
