The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave you with this thought.

[...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names.

500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means over yet. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters.

I said three or four months ago that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>win</b> the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon."
