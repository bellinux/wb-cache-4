5|$|Shot on {{location}} in Rome and at Elios Studios, Tenebrae utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebraes music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{ground was}} broken on the Kinzua Dam, which would dam the Allegheny River downriver from NY280 {{at a point}} east of Warren, Pennsylvania. The {{structure}} was completed on December13, 1965, leading {{to the creation of}} the Allegheny Reservoir. Much of NY280 was inundated by the new reservoir, as <b>were</b> <b>Cold</b> Spring, Quaker Bridge, and a significant portion of Pennsylvania Route346 (PA346) that ran along the river in Warren County. As a result, new alignments were built for both NY280 and PA346 along the eastern edge of the new reservoir. Construction of NY280's new alignment began in 1965 and was completed by 1968. NY280 now began at the realigned PA346 at the state line and ended at exit18 of the Southern Tier Expressway, which was built between Steamburg and Salamanca during the mid-1960s.|$|E

5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers <b>were</b> <b>cold,</b> and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E

McLaren appealed on the basis of measuring the car when the tyres were still warm after the race and when they <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> stating Goodyear tyres expand during the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultralight}} sequence {{was difficult}} to shoot, requiring intense coordination and actors Tim Robbins and Ed Gale to actually fly the plane. The location scout was stumped for a location for the sequence; after she described what she was looking for, a telephone repairman working in her office in San Francisco suggested Petaluma for the scene. Because of the limited shooting time, a third unit was hired {{to speed up the}} filming process. The climax was shot in a naval installation in San Francisco, where conditions <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> throughout the shoot. The film cost an estimated $36 million to produce.|$|E
25|$|Birds with {{relatively}} large eyes {{compared to their}} body mass, such as common redstarts and European robins sing earlier at dawn than birds {{of the same size}} and smaller body mass. However, if birds have the same eye size but different body masses, the larger species sings later than the smaller. This may be because the smaller bird has to start the day earlier because of weight loss overnight. Overnight weight loss for small birds is typically 5-10% and may be over 15% on cold winter nights. In one study, robins put on more mass in their dusk feeding when nights <b>were</b> <b>cold.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Anderson shelters {{performed}} well under blast and ground shock, {{because they had}} good connectivity and ductility, which meant that they could absorb {{a great deal of}} energy through plastic deformation without falling apart. (This was in marked contrast to other trench shelters which used concrete for the sides and roof, which were inherently unstable when disturbed by the effects of an explosion - if the roof slab lifted, the walls fell in under the static earth pressure; if the walls were pushed in, the roof would be unsupported at one edge and would fall.) However, when the pattern of all night alerts became established, it was realised that in winter Anderson shelters <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> damp holes in the ground and often flooded in wet weather, and so their occupancy factor would be poor. This {{led to the development of}} the indoor Morrison shelter.|$|E

25|$|Scott's planning, {{equipment}} and rations had {{been based on}} three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply. It also meant the Evans party of three {{had to try to}} split the ration pack (at a time when they <b>were</b> <b>cold</b> and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.|$|E
