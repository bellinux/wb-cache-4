Scott-Heron and Jackson produced the album in a stripped-down fashion, relying on traditional African and R sounds, while Jackson's piano-based arrangements were rooted in jazz and the blues.

40|$|International audienceWoodcock is an {{important}} game species in Northern Spain, where it is mainly a wintering species. Knowledge about the migration and origin of the woodcock <b>wintering</b> <b>in</b> Spain is relatively sparse, existing to date only qualitative analyses dating more than a decade. From the analyses of ringing recoveries of woodcock <b>wintering</b> <b>in</b> Spain, we evaluate {{the relative importance of}} various countries or regions as sources of the woodcock <b>wintering</b> <b>in</b> Spain, an estimate of their migratory route. Our analyses show the Circum-Baltic Region {{to be the most important}} breeding area of the woodcock <b>wintering</b> <b>in</b> Spain. Within that area, both Sweden and Western Russia appear to be particularly important. Analyses of the ringing locations of woodcock ringed during migration and recovered <b>in</b> Spain <b>in</b> <b>winter</b> suggest that woodcock <b>wintering</b> <b>in</b> Spain migrate primarily through the South of the Baltic Sea, Germany and France. The proportion of woodcock ringed in different French regions during the postnuptial migration months (October and November) that was subsequently recovered in Spain (mainly through hunting) declined with the proportion of those birds that was recovered in France (also mainly through hunting). We discuss the management implications of these results...|$|R
