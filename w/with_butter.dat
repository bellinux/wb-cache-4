5|$|Porcini {{are sold}} fresh in markets {{in summer and}} autumn in Central and Southern Europe, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and {{distributed}} worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed <b>with</b> <b>butter,</b> ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. They are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in Thailand. Porcini can also be frozen—either raw or first cooked in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of frozen porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer than four months. Blanching or soaking and blanching as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life up to 12 months. They are {{also one of the}} few mushroom species pickled and sold commercially.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Joining of {{dissimilar}} metals is {{to compose}} different properties of metals {{in order to}} minimize material costs {{and at the same time}} to maximize the performance of the equipment and machinery. There are a lot of methods of joining of dissimilar metals. However, the fusion welding is mostly used in a wide range of industries. This research is carried out for the process of dissimilar welding between carbon steel plates of ASTM A 516 - 70 and austenitic stainless steel plates ASTM A 214 - 316 L by using gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Welding design used is a V-groove by using the buttering process and without buttering (non-buttering) process. Types of filler metals used are ER 309 L and ER 316 L-Si. The weldment is then tested by using destructive test (DT) and non-destructive test (NDT). Weldment is also characterized by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The results show that the mechanical properties of weldment <b>with</b> <b>buttering</b> process are better compared with the weldment with a non-buttering process. The macro and microstructure of weldment <b>with</b> <b>buttering</b> process revealed finer grained and homogeneous structures compared with the one by using a non-buttering process. Moreover, welds characterization by using XRD show that the precipitation of chromium carbide on HAZ of weldment <b>with</b> <b>buttering</b> process is lower than that of weldment with a non-buttering process...|$|R
