This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented <b>with</b> <b>early</b> conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E
