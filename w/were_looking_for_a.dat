5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, coach Henning {{said that}} Tolliver was to be the starter heading into next season, and that the team would not protect Vlasic under Plan B free agency, meaning he could sign with any {{interested}} team.

5|$|Although Ruth knew he {{was nearly}} {{finished}} as a player, he desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to an advertisement, Rhodes applied to join the groundstaff of Warwickshire County Cricket Club, but the club were unable to offer him an engagement for financial reasons. At this time, Yorkshire <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> slow left arm spinner to replace Bobby Peel, who had been sacked following a disciplinary lapse on the field {{in front of his}} captain Lord Hawke in August 1897. Rhodes successfully applied for a place in a Yorkshire Colts team to play against the County XI. However, by his own later admission, Rhodes had a poor match, while his rival for Peel's place in the side, Albert Cordingley, took nine wickets.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional.

After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E

Anderson and his team were matched up against the Islanders who <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth consecutive Stanley Cup victory. During the Finals, Anderson had several noted run-ins with Islanders goaltender Billy Smith. During game one, a slash on Anderson's knee earned Smith a two-minute slashing penalty.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time. The crew <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> script which could go immediately into production {{in order to}} free up {{time to work on}} other scripts which needed more work. She handed it to executive producer Michael Piller, who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E
5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. They <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> girl aged 14–17 years {{to play the role}} of the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected {{to play the role of}} elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly attached to her father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E

5|$|After a {{brilliant}} performance displayed {{last year by}} Sowakula, it saw him scouted by Iowa Central Community College for the following year. Joining siblings Milika and Mataika Koyamainavure after Fiji Basketball development officer Laisiasa Puamau confirmed the news. He then was brought into the Otago Nuggets to participate in their 2014 campaign after a respectable showing at the Oceania Championships in New Zealand. Player-coach, Mark Dickel decided to give Sowakula a call once they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement for fellow Fijian, Marques Whippy. He made his debut starting from the bench during their match against the Taranaki Mountain Airs once he arrived in Dunedin from the previous week. Unfortunately his performances didn't live quite up to Dickel's standards after he believed Sowakula was not ready for the NBL, and instead called in former representative Tom Rowe as cover.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>A</b> local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian {{embassy in}} Moscow {{learned of the}} Soviets' {{interest}} in a series initially through reading {{an article in the}} Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, read that the Soviets <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations from the former Soviet Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} found Crispin Bonham-Carter to {{have the}} best physical contrast to Firth's Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but Adrian Lukis was cast instead. Anna Chancellor, of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame, played Mr Bingley's sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen's six-times-great-niece) Mr Bingley's other sister and his brother-in-law were played by Lucy Robinson (Louisa Hurst) and Rupert Vansittart (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. Barbara Leigh-Hunt was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.|$|E
