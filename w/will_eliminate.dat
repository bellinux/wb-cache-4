The circle itself could not handle the 17,000 vehicles {{a year that}} use the large roadway daily, and {{was the site of}} several accidents, including 45 in 2007 alone. The entire traffic circle conversion <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> two businesses in the area and is still slated for construction.|$|E

Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts {{the game with}} three nuclear devices, which once used <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> all enemies from the screen. Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E

5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E

25|$|Discs can be {{machined}} {{to eliminate}} thickness variation and lateral run-out. Machining {{can be done}} in situ (on-car) or off-car (bench lathe). Both methods <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> thickness variation. Machining on-car with proper equipment can also eliminate lateral run-out due to hub-face non-perpendicularity.|$|E

25|$|Removal of the {{associated}} tooth <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the plaque stagnation area, and thus eliminate any further episodes of pericoronitis. Removal is indicated when the involved tooth will not erupt any further due to impaction or ankylosis; if extensive work {{would be required to}} restore structural damage; or to allow improved oral hygiene. Sometimes the opposing tooth is also extracted if no longer required.|$|E
25|$|Rigorous {{infection}} protocols {{are required}} to minimize this risk of transmission. Infection control measures, such as wearing gloves and noncritical medical devices used for a single person with CDI, are effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of C. difficile in the hospital setting. In addition, washing {{with soap and water}} <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective.|$|E

Use of the GCT was estimated {{to result in a}} time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.|$|E
25|$|In nations where Islamic law is {{the basis}} of civil law, but has not been codified, as is the case of some Arab {{countries}} in the Middle East, fatāwā by the national religious leadership are debated prior to being issued. In theory, such fatāwā should rarely be contradictory. If two fatāwā are potentially contradictory, the ruling bodies (combined civil and religious law) would attempt to define a compromise interpretation that <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the resulting ambiguity. In these cases, the national theocracies expect fatwā to be settled law.|$|E
25|$|Character {{displacement}} is {{the phenomenon}} where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species’ distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species {{for a limited}} resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> or exclude the other through competition.|$|E

25|$|On 27 February 2005 the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, took effect. The FCTC is the world's {{first public}} health treaty. Countries that sign on as parties {{agree to a}} set of common goals, minimum {{standards}} for tobacco control policy, and to cooperate in dealing with cross-border challenges such as cigarette smuggling. Currently the WHO declares that 4 billion people will be covered by the treaty, which includes 168 signatories. Among other steps, signatories are to put together legislation that <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> secondhand smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} views will be {{obstructed}} due to new {{construction in the}} immediate future. After more than 40 years of unimpeded north and northwest views, in spring 2006 construction began on vacant lots immediately northwest of the towers {{at the intersection of}} North Dearborn and West Kinzie Streets for separate projects, including a mid-rise hotel and a high-rise office building, which will partially obscure views from Marina City in these directions. Also in 2006, site preparation began on a high-rise office building west of Marina City at North LaSalle Street and the Chicago River which, when completed, <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the unimpeded view of the western horizon from Marina City's uppermost floors and roofdecks.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{target area}} (Block 1, 2 and 3) has a total surface of 1000 km2, {{and the first}} block (northern part) can be {{considered}} free of tsetse, as intensive monitoring has failed to detect since 2012 a single wild tsetse fly. The prevalence of AAT has decreased from 40-50% before the project started to less than 10% to date in blocks 1 and 2. Although insecticides are being used for fly suppression, they are applied for short periods on traps, nets and livestock, and are not spread into the environment. After the suppression activities are completed, no more insecticide is applied in the area. The removal of trypanosomosis <b>will</b> <b>eliminate</b> the need for constant prophylactic treatments of the cattle with trypanocidal drugs, therefore reducing residues of these drugs in the dung, meat and milk.|$|E
