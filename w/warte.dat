40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in June 2015. The sampling and measurement of water quality were carried out in Sergang and Marok Tua coastal waters of Singkep Island, Riau Archipelago. This study was aimed to determine the distribution of benthic foraminifera and relative sedimentation rate in both areas. Survey method was used by taking samples from 2 stasions with 3 replicates at each stasion. Samples of sediments were taken and then analyzed {{to determine the number}} of individual, species, distribution pattern, the relative sedimentation rate and sediment fractions. The results showed that the number of individual of benthic foraminifera found in the <b>wartes</b> of Sergang were higher than in Marok Tua. In contrary the number of species of benthic foraminifera found in Marok Tua were higher than in Sergang. Sediment fraction in Sergang was dominated by fine sand and very fine sand. Based on Morisita index, the pattern of benthic foraminifera distribution was categorized as cluster. Results of the relative sedimentation rate calculation were divided into high in Sergang coastal waters that has limited antrophogenic activities with an average of 83. 06 %. Lower sedimentation rate was found in Marok Tua with an average of 67. 47 %. Marok Tua coastal waters has more antrophogenic activities such as fishing boat activities, residential as well as tin and sand mining areas...|$|R

50|$|Since the 1860s {{there were}} {{different}} views among Austrian, German and Italian alpinists {{as to whether}} the Kellerspitzen or the Hohe <b>Warte</b> (Monte Coglians) was the highest mountain in the Carnic Alps. Paul Grohmann, the geologist and palaeontologist Fritz Frech from Breslau and Georg Geyer from Vienna claimed the Kellerspitzen, shown on the Austrian map with a height of 2,813 metres, was the highest summit; the Italians Giovanni Marinelli and Arturo Ferrucci from the Italian Alpine Club, by contrast, favoured the Hohe <b>Warte,</b> which was marked on the Tavolette 1:50,000, Prato Carnico map with a height of 2,782. Today it is believed that the Hohe <b>Warte,</b> at 2,780 metres, is the highest mountain in the region, beating the Kellerspitzen by around 6 metres.|$|E
