5|$|After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures {{brought in}} two African-American {{consultants}} {{to review and}} approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, {{vice president of the}} local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a <b>write-up</b> of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his <b>write-up</b> for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

Thus, the <b>write-up</b> operation permitted in the usual *-Property is not present, only a write-to-same operation. The Strong Star Property is usually discussed in the context of multilevel database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns. This Strong Star Property was anticipated in the Biba model where it was shown that strong integrity in combination with the Bell–LaPadula model resulted in reading and writing at a single level.|$|E
25|$|Earlier, in January, {{when the}} company formed, Henry Tizard, the rector of Imperial College London and {{chairman}} of the Aeronautical Research Committee (ARC), had prompted the Air Ministry's Director of Scientific Research to ask for a <b>write-up</b> of the design. The report was once again passed on to Griffith for comment, but was not received back until March 1937 by which point Whittle's design was well along. Griffith had already started construction of his own turbine engine design and, perhaps to avoid tainting his own efforts, he returned a somewhat more positive review. However, he remained highly critical of some features, notably the use of jet thrust. The Engine Sub-Committee of ARC studied Griffith's report, and decided to fund his effort instead.|$|E
25|$|Various {{scientific}} disciplines have developed taxonomic classification systems to describe natural phenomena or individuals, like for example, plants or animals. These systems {{are based on}} specific characteristics like shape of organs or nature of reproduction. Differently, in landslide classification, there are great difficulties because phenomena are not perfectly repeatable; usually being characterised by different causes, movements and morphology, and involving genetically different material. For this reason, landslide classifications are based on different discriminating factors, sometimes very subjective. In the following <b>write-up,</b> factors are discussed by dividing them into two groups: {{the first one is}} made up of the criteria utilised in the most widespread classification systems that can generally be easily determined. The second one is formed by those factors that have been utilised in some classifications and can be useful in descriptions.|$|E

25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the <b>write-up</b> in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.|$|E

In addition, the film features two separate but connected worlds, another hallmark of Lynch's writings. The film's art direction would have featured a heavily industrial backdrop, setting the action against an [...] "oil slick, smokestack, steel-steam-soot, fire-sparks and electrical arcs realm", similar to the direction ultimately taken in the depiction of Victorian England in The Elephant Man and the planet Giedi Prime in Dune. Although Lynch's first two feature-length films were shot in black-and-white, he had hoped to film Ronnie Rocket in color, inspired by the works of French film-maker Jacques Tati. Lynch planned to experiment for some time in order to find the right balance and application of color for the film.|$|E

500|$|Hordern cited Saint's Days {{negative}} publicity {{as having done}} his career [...] "the power of good" [...] as it {{brought him to the}} attention of the director Glen Byam Shaw, who cast him in a series of plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1951. Among the roles were Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. Hordern claimed to know very little about the bard's works and sought advice from friends about how best to prepare for the roles. The same year, he travelled down to Nettlefold Studios, Walton-on-Thames, to film Scrooge, an adaptation of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, in which he played Marley's ghost. Reviews were mixed with The New York Times giving it a favourable <b>write-up,</b> while Time magazine remained ambivalent. The Aberdeen Evening Express echoed the comments made by an American reviewer by calling Scrooge a [...] "trenchant and inspiring Christmas show". The author Fred Guida, writing in his book Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination in 2000, thought that Marley's ghost, though a [...] "small but pivotal role", was [...] "brilliantly played" [...] by Hordern.|$|E

[...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book, I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, that: [...] "Only The Simpsons could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good indeed." [...] In the book Leaving Springfield, Matthew Henry praised the episode's critiquing of [...] "the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious", as well as its other themes. Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of good satire as it [...] "managed to explore a lot of [...] issues in quite a deep way [...] without being overtly political", which she claimed, along with the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like Queer as Folk. In his review of The Simpsons – The Complete Eighth Season DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] "certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes".|$|E
500|$|Dude Ranch was {{released}} when {{the band was}} only achieving moderate success, therefore very few critical reviews of the record were published in 1997. A CMJ <b>write-up</b> commented, [...] "Dude Ranch has the hooks and sonic wallop to rocket Blink-182 into stadiums throughout the nation." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang! published an early review, albeit negative: the reviewer laments the disc's [...] "little depth, passion, soul and even vaguely memorable hooks." [...] Later reviews were subsequently more positive. Rolling Stone regarded Dude Ranch as the moment the trio focused and refined their pop punk sound, summarizing the record's themes: [...] "bassist Mark Hoppus plays the straight man, singing sturdily and deadpan, while the squeakier-voiced Guitarist Tom DeLonge bleats urgently about romance gone wrong." [...] In 2007, Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic attributed the album's unique sound to the band's young age at the time, commenting [...] "Ten years ago, blink-182 were just breaking through as a young band whose sound was a bit rough around the edges, not too polished or refined yet. [...] On Dude Ranch, blink-182 were kids being kids, and that’s precisely what {{they should have been}} doing." [...] The website AbsolutePunk placed the album on their [...] "Absolute Classics" [...] list in February 2009, calling it a [...] "classic mix" [...] that was successful due to timing. In 2011, Total Guitar referred to the record as [...] "a genuine modern punk classic." [...] Alternative Press called Dude Ranch a [...] "quantum leap in sonic quality and songwriting." ...|$|E
