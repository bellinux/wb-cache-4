So much depends on the exertions {{of the people in}} these voyages, that it is the {{practice}} to give every man a direct interest in the result. Consequently, all on board engage for a compensation to be derived from a division of the return cargo. The terms on which a party engages are called his [...] "lay;" [...] and he gets so many parts of a hundred, according to station, experience and qualifications. The owner is paid for his risk and expenses in the same way, the vessel and outfits usually taking about two-thirds of the whole returns, while the officers and crew get the other. These conditions vary a little, as the proceeds of whaling and sealing rise or fall in the market, and also in reference to the cost of equipments. It follows that Captain Daggett and his crew were actually putting their hands into their own pockets, when they lost time in remaining with the crippled craft. This Gardiner knew, and it caused him to appreciate their kindness at a rate so much higher than he might otherwise have done.|$|E
40|$|The {{institution}} of farm service was mainly a West-European phenomenon. It {{was linked to}} the high age at marriage and it was an important system for the distribution of labour in agriculture. In Sweden, the use of farm servants in peasant agriculture intensified in the 18 th century and remained important up till the advent of industrialization. The growth of a class of property-less, rural labourers did not undermine the system of farm service, as is sometimes claimed. Patriarchalism was an ideology intimately connected with farm service. During the 18 th century, however, patriarchalism was not the common frame of reference among the upper classes when discussing state policy towards serv­ants. Patriarchalism did not become an important ideology until the beginning of the 19 th century. It was inspired by the liberal critique of the old, mercantilist attitude towards labour. At the grass-root level, farm servants showed a culturally defined hostility towards wage labour. They tried to exchange <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> for different kinds of rights and liberties, which might have served the purpose of disguising the employer-employee relationship to the peasant masters. An egalitarian ideology, typical of especially northern Sweden's peasantry, might have strengthened this hostility to being wage earners instead of having independent ways of making a living. digitalisering@um...|$|E

Ovim radom prikazuje se dob šegrta pri stupanju u nauk, trajanje nauka, plaće obrtničkih šegrta i pomoćnika te običaje u gradu vezane uz njih. Uz to se prikazuje podrijetlo i plaća sluga i sluškinjate njihova prava. Slijedom tih oskudnih podataka daje se uvid u jedan dio društvene povijesti grada u prvoj polovini 15. stoljeća. For {{the city}} of Rijeka in 15 th century {{there is only one}} {{existing}} notary book written by Antonio de Renno from Modena and it encompasses period from 1437 to 1465. This article deals with topics such as: age of boys at the start of apprenticeship, its duration, wages of craftsman apprentices and helpers etc. For comparison it is taken into account extant research regarding this topic for communes in Dalmatia. When compared it seems that situation in Rijeka regarding all of aforementioned topics did not differ from Dalmatian communes. In general, apprentices could learn between 4 and 10 years, all of them had <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> and some of them got tools for their craft. Wages of apprentices were around 2 ducat per year and of lower amount than those of helpers. The differences in wage were up to 6 or 10 ducats greater {{in the case of the}} helpers in some crafts. It seems that this difference was especially significant among the helpers of manufacturers of oars (remerius). This is not so surprising when one takes into account that researchers emphasized that Senj and Rijeka were major ship manufacturing centres in the North Adriatic in the Late Middle Ages. Man-servants (famuli) which served masters outside city, mainly in Apennine peninsula, had greater wages than those who served in Rijeka or in other cities on the East Adriatic. Maid-servants (ancillae) were poorly paid, when compared with male servants. Unfortunately investigation of their status is difficult to conduct because there are only nine existing contracts...|$|E

40|$|Specifying {{the labour}} theory {{of value in}} a way that distinguishes both {{productive}} from unproductive labour, and production workers from supervisory workers, this paper considers distributive shares in the US economy between 1964 and 2001. Trends in productive and unproductive labour are explored in full-time equivalents, hours and money. After 1979, there was a large shift of money value (not matched by a shift in either hours or employment) from the wages paid to productive labour to those paid to supervisory labour. Since the <b>wage</b> share <b>in</b> <b>money</b> value added of non-supervisory labour in unproductive sectors was approximately constant, the 1980 s and 1990 s also saw the profits share squeezed by the rising wage share of supervisory workers. Some implications of this are explored in the construction of a class rather than a factor approach to distributive shares. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

These features of wages have been noted in numerous analyses and commen-taries and have been connected, albeit at times imprecisely, to a range of processes. These include financialization, ubiquitous precariousness, new forms of the extraction of surplus, attacks on social reproduction, the dismantling of the social wage, and a generalized intensification of the power of capital vis-à-vis labor. In turn, various strategies have been proposed to address the prob-lem of <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> the post-Fordist order, strategies that attempt in different ways to reconnect wages to labor and/or to the costs of social reproduc-tion, that is, to the reproduction of life, including the reproduction of labor power.

40|$|In {{a number}} of {{influential}} recent papers, Taylor (1979 a, b; 1980 a, b) has analyzed the behaviour of an economy characterized by staggered over-lapping wage contracts and rational expectations. His model has the "Keynesian" feature that the second moment of the distribution function of real output is not invariant under changes in the deterministic (and known) components of monetary policy rules. The {{reason for this is}} the inertia <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>wage</b> process induced by the staggered multi-period contracts and the assumption that the <b>wage</b> payments due <b>in</b> any given period under the contract are not "indexed", that is not made contingent on the actually realized values of such nominal variables as the general price level.

40|$|In this article, {{we provide}} a {{re-examination}} of Ludwig Lachmann’s {{take on the}} controversy between Piero Sraffa and Friedrich von Hayek, which took place {{after the publication of}} the latter’s Prices and Production in 1931. Initially an ally of Hayek, Lachmann also immensely respected Sraffa. As a result, Lachmann provided a review critical of both sides. A particularly interesting point is that Lachmann questioned an assertion made by Sraffa in his initial review, and approved by Hayek in his reply, according to which in a barter economy there could be as many Wicksellian natural interest rates as there are commodities. Drawing partly on Sraffa’s 1960 book Production of Commodities per means of Commodities, Lachmann showed that there should be only one natural interest rate, since relative prices should reflect the discrepancy between the various ‘own rates of interest’ pertaining to each commodity. Moreover, Sraffa criticised Hayek for not acknowledging {{the full extent of the}} role of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> an economy, using the example of <b>wages</b> being paid <b>in</b> <b>money</b> to show that not only is money not neutral, but it also constitutes a fundamental institutional aspect of the way economic flows are organised. Sraffa’s argument could be turned against him, as it could be argued that since lending takes place <b>in</b> <b>money,</b> the rate of interest charged on loans should not have to be equal to any of the commodity own rates of interest in the economy. Instead, the rate of interest should be based on Sraffa’s composite commodity from his 1960 opus. The only situation in which interest rates could vary depending on commodities, would be if expectations regarding productivity and upcoming prices and output varied among economic agents. Interestingly, this line of reasoning is very close to Lachmann’s radical subjectivism...|$|R

During the last three years ships with over 300 emigrants have arrived several times in Trinidad without a single death. On their arrival in Trinidad, those who are sick are sent at once to the hospital; those unfit for immediate labour are sent to the depot. The healthy are 'indentured'--in plain English, apprenticed- -for five years, and distributed among the estates which have applied for them.
