5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons {{are thought}} to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of gold foil, {{and concluded}} that the monument that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today</b> — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E

5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today</b> largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the rest}} of the 20th century many {{recreation}} facilities were incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling green in the Recreation Grounds was laid out by the City Council in 1962 to join the green in the Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, I took a photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E

5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

Muttuchira church was known as 'Njayapally'in olden days.. There was no place called Muttuchira back then. The paddy fields that <b>we</b> <b>seen</b> <b>today</b> close to the church could have been lakes before in olden days.

25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today</b> is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder.

However, those who seek shall find, {{and if they are}} able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E
25|$|Most locks have a bypass flume, {{which allows}} water {{to bypass the}} lock to water the level below. If the flume was covered over with concrete, that {{generally}} meant that a roadway passed over the lock. Originally the locks 1-27, {{with the possible exception}} of Lock 13 did not have bypass flumes, using the culverts to divert water, but later the bypass flumes were put in (which is what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today).</b>|$|E
25|$|Research in {{the field}} of paleontology, the study of fossils, {{supports}} the idea that all living organisms are related. Fossils provide evidence that accumulated changes in organisms {{over long periods of time}} have led to the diverse forms of life <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> A fossil itself reveals the organism's structure and the relationships between present and extinct species, allowing paleontologists to construct a family tree for all of the life forms on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Few {{institutions}} puzzle outsiders {{as much as}} {{the modern}} university. Even insiders may not grasp the primal essence of its life and behavior. The sheer size and diversity of many universities defeats orderly consideration. We adopt crude simplifications or, worse, numbing obfuscation. This is entirely unnecessary. The core of university life can be illuminated clearly through the prism of a rich and beguiling metaphor. This metaphor requires only that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today's</b> university as a thinly disguised feudal society such as existed in Europe during the 11 th or 12 th century A. D.

25|$|Before the {{invention}} of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{three main}} themes {{to the museum}} are land, tools and people. Many of the {{artifacts}} and equipment originally came from the existing museum at Ingliston, others came from an operational traditional working farm, as well as items which were donated and some which were specific acquisitions. The displays illustrate how people lived and worked the land in the past, and how this helped shape the countryside which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> The museum also includes items which highlight the folklore aspects of the farming way of life, including a 'cup marked' stone, a collection of charms and many other display items.|$|E
25|$|The east wing was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} the newly founded Noblewomen's Collegiate Foundation. New ceilings were installed, court building director Constantin Johann Walter was named creative planner, and in 1767 Maria Theresa placed her court architect Nikolaus Pacassi—responsible for converting Schönbrunn Palace into a residential palace in Rococo style—in charge of the design and appearance of the main façade on Rennweg. After the roof framework was modified in 1774, the Giants' Hall ceiling fresco was executed by Franz Anton Maulbertsch, the master of Austrian Rococo, between 1775 and 1776. The result of this extended renovation project under Maria Theresa is the Hofburg <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|Structure {{formation}} {{refers to}} the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the Friedmann solutions to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure. If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there {{would not have been}} enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sutherland was {{partially}} deaf and therefore {{decided not to}} play a very active part in politics which was the path well worn by his contemporary peers. Instead he expended his energies by spending some of his vast wealth which he inherited from his father on improving his homes. In 1845, he employed Sir Charles Barry to make vast alterations to Dunrobin Castle. Barry transformed the place into the 189-room ducal palace which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today.</b> In addition to Dunrobin, the Duke also had Barry completely remodel his Staffordshire seat of Trentham Hall, Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire, and the family's London townhouse, Stafford House, which was the most valuable private home {{in the whole of}} London.|$|E
25|$|May we not say that, in the fortuitous {{combination}} of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures could survive in whose organizations {{a certain degree of}} adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>today</b> are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E
