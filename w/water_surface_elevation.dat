25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E

Multiple pump stations move water from lesser sloughs in both districts into the main slough. Parts of this subwatershed are unprotected by levees and are vulnerable to 100-year floods.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{relatively}} flat design slopes {{typically associated with}} nature-like fishways, these are typically only considered to be viable passage options for low head dams. In addition to the shallow slopes, the typical intake configuration only allows operation {{of these types of}} fish ways over a limited range of <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> These characteristics often rule out the use of a nature-like fish way for storage reservoirs or other impoundments where the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> can fluctuate over a wide range of elevations.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{model of}} unsteady shallow-water flow in surface irrigation {{was developed to}} evaluate the influence of field-grading precision on surface irrigation performance. This paper presents field data for verification of this 2 D model. No attempt was made here to evaluate irrigation performance. Verification of such models relies on independent estimates of parameters for infiltration and roughness. To accomplish this, <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> were measured at 26 points within a 3 ha level basin. A double-bubbler system was used to obtain relative water depths.

40|$|In 1999, Alameda County {{completed}} {{the restoration of}} a 1 -mile stretch of Tassajara Creek in Dublin, California. The project created a compound channel with a low-flow channel capacity of Q 5 in the upper and middle reaches, Q 2 in the lower reach, and a natural floodplain terrace along all reaches to accommodate the design-estimated 100 - year flood of 5, 200 cfs. Downstream of the restoration reach is a trapezoidal concrete channel. On December 30 th and 31 st of 2005, a 20 -year storm with a cumulative rainfall of 3. 56 inches passed over the Tassajara Creek watershed, generating flows that overtopped the low-flow banks of Tassajara Creek, providing an opportunity to assess flow capacity of the compound channel configuration. We conducted long profile and cross-section surveys along the entire restoration reach, and the first 100 feet of the concrete channel. Using the Manning Equation in a HEC-RAS steady flow model, we used the geometry of the concrete channel and the elevation of the high water marks to estimate the peak flow from the storm as 1, 500 cfs. We then back-calculated the roughness coefficient (Manning’s "n") for each compound channel cross-section by matching model <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> to observed elevations. We also compared the design 2 -year and 5 -year low flow channel <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> to modeled <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> using our calibrated roughness values.

40|$|Scientific {{studies have}} {{suggested}} {{an increase in the}} frequency and intensity of flooding. The research presented herein is focused on a small watershed, which has experienced intense flooding of a downstream, urbanized area. For emergency response and preparedness, it is pertinent {{to have the ability to}} predict intensity and peak flows of a flood. The Town of Dyer, Indiana has been severely impacted by flooding in the last twenty years. A 37. 6 square mile watershed begins in a rural section of Illinois with tributaries draining into Plum Creek. The creek crosses into Indiana and becomes Hart Ditch, a straight, narrow, deep channel through the urbanized Town of Dyer. A HEC-HMS hydrologic model was used and calibrated based on USGS gage data. Storm events ranging from short, high intensity to long, intermittent precipitation provided a vast representation of possible scenarios within the watershed. The hydrologic model was paired with an unsteady HEC-RAS hydraulic model to allow for different lateral inflows to the creek providing variations of flow. A comparison between upstream and downstream stream gage readings was utilized to create a working model that predicts downstream <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> for previous real-time storm and hypothetical storms. These conditions were analyzed by two stream gages and a correlation between the two gages was developed. This correlation was used to predict downstream <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> The correlation was also used to determine the time to crest based on readings at the upstream gage for many different storm events. The ability to know downstream <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> for real-time storm events allows a window of time to implement emergency response in areas where flooding is imminent.

Notable differences were identified in model accuracy if a project is concerned with river processes occurring {{within the limits of}} the bankfull channel versus floodplain regions. Increased cross section discretization, bankfull channel detail and main channel roughness were of greatest field survey and measurement importance when processes relevant to the bankfull channel are of concern (i. e. geomorphic processes or sediment transport). Conversely, where flood conditions are of highest consideration, estimates of floodplain roughness dominate the accuracy of the results of computed <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> Results for this case study also demonstrate that higher orders of total station field surveys provide little additional accuracy in final predicted <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> <b>elevations,</b> relative to proper estimates of in-channel and floodplain roughness.
