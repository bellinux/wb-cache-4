5000|$|On the 130th lap, Tony Bettenhausen started {{suffering}} a handling problem exiting turn two. Down the backstretch, his right-front <b>wheel</b> <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> {{may have come}} off the car, and the wheel began to loosen. In turn three, the wheel came off and began rolling though the north short chute. Second place Roberto Guerrero {{came up on the}} wheel suddenly, and hit it with his nosecone. The nosecone cover was broken off, and the wheel was punted high into the air. The wheel cleared the catchfencing, and flew towards the [...] "K" [...] grandstand. Spectators were witnessed fleeing the seating in a [...] "V" [...] shape as the 18-pound wheel headed their direction. The wheel came down and struck 41-year-old Lyle Kurtenbach of Rothschild, Wisconsin in the head, sitting in the top row of the grandstand. He suffered massive head injuries, and was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospital shortly afterwards. The wheel bounded and came to rest in the tunnel underneath the north short chute.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> {{may have}} {{different}} shapes. Aftermarket alloy and forged rims often require specific <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to match their mounting holes, so it is often required {{to get a new}} set of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> when the rims are changed.|$|R
5000|$|Lug {{wrenches}} may be L-shaped, or X-shaped. The form {{commonly found}} in car trunks is an L-shaped metal rod with a socket wrench on the bent end and a prying tip on the other end. The prying tip is mainly intended to remove hub caps or wheel covers that may be covering a <b>wheel's</b> <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rarely, {{and more}} often with large trucks and lorries, {{insufficient}} force {{can lead to the}} nuts coming undone while in use. Because of this, it is best to use a torque wrench or similar tool to finally tighten the <b>wheel</b> <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to the proper torque specification as soon as possible after using a lug wrench to affix a wheel. At the very least, the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> should be checked for tightness after 50-100 km/miles when things have been subject to some vibration and thermal cycling.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} Dynapack Dyno {{requires}} the wheels to be removed prior to tuning. Adapters are then bolted onto the <b>wheel</b> hubs using <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to properly center them. The dyno is then connected to the adapters and locked into place.|$|R
5000|$|This Accord was {{the first}} to use <b>wheels</b> with five <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> instead of the {{traditional}} four on 4-cylinder models. The 4-cylinder version came with [...] and 160 lbft Nm ( [...] and 161 lbft Nm for 2005-2007 models) K24A1 2397 cc 4 cyl engine mated to a 5-speed automatic or 5-speed manual. The 4-cylinder engine also utilized a timing chain instead of a timing belt.|$|R
25|$|The GTO {{underwent}} a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered tail lights were replaced with eight tail lights, four on each side. Rally II <b>wheels</b> with colored <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> were {{also available in}} 1967. The GTO emblems located on the rear part of the fenders were moved to the chrome rocker panels. Also the grill was changed from a purely split grill, to one that shared some chrome.|$|R
2500|$|The Budd Company {{kept the}} only {{prototype}} model, but later renamed it [...] "XR-Budd" [...] {{and used it}} for marketing purposes. The Rambler lettering on {{the rear of the}} trunk lid was removed, while the stamped steel wheels with full wheel covers were upgraded to chrome-plated reverse <b>wheels</b> with exposed <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> Budd sold the prototype to The Henry Ford Museum in 1997. It is now at the museum and also displayed at major classic car shows.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1965 models, {{the engine}} was updated to the four-barrel {{carburetor}} version of the [...] unit, but generated [...] The '65 had a few performance options, which include a handling package, a special fan, and a [...] "Power Transfer" [...] rear axle. Special features included a black-out, stand-up grille, bucket seats with sew-through pleats, centre console, chrome-plate <b>wheel</b> covers with <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> engine [...] "Dress Up Kit", unique insignias, a vinyl roof in black or white and a Power-Pac gauge cluster for the heavily padded instrument panel.|$|R
50|$|The Legacy {{broke with}} many Subaru traditions, such as no longer {{locating}} the spare tire {{in the engine}} compartment, behind the engine and above the transmission, a tradition started with the 1966 Subaru 1000, a method also used in the Citroën GS. The Legacy was also the second Subaru to use <b>wheels</b> with five <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> instead of four to better cope with the increased horsepower and torque from the powertrain. The Legacy was an all-new model, and was slotted at the top in Subaru's model range, joining the Leone, the Subaru XT coupé, Subaru Justy sub-compact, and the Subaru Rex and Subaru Sambar kei cars in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|The (A12) 440 engine option {{with three}} Holley 2-barrel carburetors {{was added to}} the lineup at mid-year. The [...] "440 Six Pack" [...] had no wheel covers or hubcaps, only the 15x6" [...] "H" [...] stamped steel black <b>wheels</b> with chrome <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b> It {{featured}} a black fiberglass lift-off hood with 4 hood pins and a large functional hood scoop with a red sticker on each side saying [...] "440 6BBL". The scoop sealed to the large air breather. All cars had a Dana 60 rear axle with a 4.10 gear ratio. Production of the 440 6-bbl A12 option Road Runner was approximately 1,432. The A12 option had an [...] "M" [...] as the fifth character in the VIN. The 440 engine was rated at [...] @ 4,700 rpm, and [...] of torque @ 3200 rpm, the same torque as the Hemi but at a lower engine speed. The Plymouth Road Runner was named Motor Trend [...] "Car of the Year" [...] for 1969. Domestic production for the three body styles was 81,125 with an additional 3,295 deliveries in Canada and other countries.|$|R
50|$|A center cap, or centercap is a {{decorative}} disk on an automobile wheel that covers a central {{portion of the}} wheel. Early center caps for automobiles were small and primarily served the purpose of keeping dirt away from the spindle nut and wheel bearings of vehicles. Center caps are often found on new cars to hide the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> and/or the bearing. Center caps are a type of hubcap, the other primary type being wheel covers. Some modern center caps are retained to the wheel using spring clips, while others are retained by the <b>wheel</b> <b>lugs</b> or other threaded fasteners.|$|R
50|$|The two tire changers {{remove the}} <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> and (if not {{done by the}} jackman) the old tire and tighten the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on the new tire. One tire changer is solely {{responsible}} for the front tires, while the other {{is responsible for the}} rears. NASCAR requires a wheel to have five traditional <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> as opposed to the single locking <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> seen in Formula One. Many jackmen watch the tire changers to make sure the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> are tight.|$|R
5000|$|NASCAR {{no longer}} will penalize or monitor missing <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> during pit stops, leaving the teams to self-police <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Automobiles {{have also}} used left-threaded <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on left-side <b>wheels,</b> but now {{commonly}} use tapered <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> {{which do not}} precess.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aftermarket}} wheels {{will only}} fit smaller <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> or not allow an ordinary <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> to be properly torqued down because a socket will {{not fit into}} the lug hole. Tuner <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> were created {{to solve this problem}} by utilizing a special key to allow removal and installation with standard lug wrench or socket. The design of tuner <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> can range from bit style to multisided or spline drive, and are sometimes lightweight for performance purposes.|$|R
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on <b>wheel</b> studs, or bolts. <b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> (aka <b>wheel</b> nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for the <b>wheel</b> will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for steel <b>wheels</b> and flat seated <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for alloy <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> or <b>wheel</b> nut is a fastener, {{specifically}} a nut, used {{to secure}} a wheel on a vehicle. Typically, <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a <b>wheel</b> with a <b>lug</b> wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make the nuts very difficult to remove. Also, uneven torque between the various <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the brake rotor if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, impact wrenches should properly be used only for removing <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> must be {{installed}} in an alternating pattern, {{commonly referred to as}} a star pattern. This ensures a uniform distribution of load across the wheel mounting surface. When installing <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> it is recommended to tighten them with a calibrated torque wrench. While a lug, socket or impact wrench may be used to tighten <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> the final tightening should be performed by a torque wrench, ensuring an accurate and adequate load is applied. Torque specifications vary by vehicle and wheel type. Both vehicle and wheel manufacturers provide recommended torque values which should be consulted when an installation is done. Failure to abide by the recommended torque value can result in damage to the wheel and brake rotor/drum. Additionally, under tightened <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> may come loose with time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or impact wrench. If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. <b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an impact wrench can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Beginning at the May Talladega race, NASCAR began {{enforcing}} <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> again, {{a practice}} which was discontinued after the 2013 season. The rule now required all 5 <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on all 4 wheels must be [...] "installed {{in a safe}} and secure manner." [...] If during post-race inspection a wheel {{is found to be}} missing a <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> or a <b>lug</b> not is not secured, it was an automatic P3 penalty resulting in the crew chief, tire changer, and tire carrier each receiving a one race suspension and fine. The change comes after mass criticism, particularly from owner-driver Tony Stewart, about poor safety practices occurring from lack of enforcement.|$|R

50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} or <b>Lug</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators are}} used both by auto mechanics and drivers to identify <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> which require tightening, {{as well as}} by accident investigators to detect faults after accidents. Although not compulsory in most jurisdictions, road safety bodies recommend their use, especially on large or heavy vehicles such as buses, coaches, large vans, and trucks.|$|R
50|$|The centerbore of a {{wheel is}} the size of the hole {{in the back of the}} wheel that centers it over the {{mounting}} hub of the car. Some factory wheels have a centerbore that matches exactly with the hub to reduce vibration by keeping the wheel centered. Wheels with the correct centerbore to the car they will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> reducing the job of the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to center the wheel to the car. Wheels that are not hubcentric are known as lugcentric, as the job of centering is done by the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> assuming they are properly torqued down.|$|R
50|$|A <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> is a nut {{with one}} rounded or conical (tapered) end, used on steel and most {{aluminum}} wheels. A set of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> are typically used {{to secure a}} wheel to threaded wheel studs and thereby to a vehicle's axles.Some designs (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volkswagen) use lug bolts instead of nuts, which screw into a tapped (threaded) hole in the wheel's hub or drum brake or disc. This configuration {{is commonly known as}} a bolted joint.|$|R
50|$|Loose {{wheel nut}} {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> of the <b>wheels</b> of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose wheel nut indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R
