'I {{only did}} for you, Miss Hawtrey, {{exactly what the}} guides did for Miss Fortescue and her sister; there is nothing very terrible in {{carrying}} a weight when you get it comfortably fixed. Why, the porters in the Andes think nothing of carrying people right over the mountains; {{it is only a}} matter of getting weight properly balanced. I saw how the guides did; they knotted the shawls over their caps just above the peak. They carry weights here you know, as they do in most mountain countries, with a strap across the forehead. Coming over the ice I really did feel you heavy, though I had two others to help me with you, but the cold seemed to have taken all one's strength out of one, and the weight was all on one side; coming down was nothing in comparison. I believe I could have carried you right down to the hotel here with an occasional rest. I was as warm as a toast when we got into the wood. You must not think or say anything more about it; if you do I shall straightway pack up my kit and take my place in the next diligence wherever it may be going to.

5000|$|In {{the ensuing}} yuga, called Thretha Yuga, Sivan, as per {{the request of}} Mayon, created the fourth piece of the {{primordial}} Kroni as a ten-headed mighty warrior, with the ten mountains as ten heads, naming him as Ravanan. He oppressed all those living on Earth by extracting Uliyam from them. He subdued all the earthly kings and made them pay tributes to him. Suffering under his oppression, the Devas sought the help of Mayon who, {{for the purpose of}} destroying him, took birth as Raman. On his death-bed, he repented, saying: [...] "Only with the help of my brother <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to destroy me."

5000|$|In {{the sixth}} yuga, called Dwapara Yuga, the fifth {{fragment}} of Kroni was portioned into a hundred pieces, and made into Duriyodhanan and ninety-nine brothers to support him.

The wicked Duriyodhanan was killed by the Pancha Pandavas, {{with the support of}} Mayon, who {{came in the form of}} Krishna. Even at the brink of death, Duriyodhanan refused to repent, saying that [...] "only with your cunning mind <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to defeat me, and otherwise not." [...] Mayon then told him: [...] "You will be created with knowledge, intelligence, and artistic skill in the next Yukam, and if you do not repent in that age, that will be your eternal annihilation." [...] Having said this, Mayon went to Srirangam and dwelt there.|$|E
50|$|The {{only thing}} {{actually}} {{located in the}} area {{at the time was}} the main road and the bridge to Frösön, the then mercantile and administrative centre of Jämtland. The trade in Jämtland couldn't be prevented from the Norrlandic coast, all trade restrictions such as border controls, punishments, trade prohibition and tariffs were unsatisfying for the Swedish authority. The Jamts were too cunning and some people claim that the Jamtish signature mark bällt du luur'n (<b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to trick him) derives from the Jamtish attempts to trick the Swedish border guard in order to avoid paying customs on merchandises brought back from Norway. This development wasn't unique for Sweden, it occurred throughout the Nordic countries, in today's Finland the cities Tampere, Kuopio and Kaskinen were founded. Though Östersund is, as stated in the beginning, the only city in today's Sweden founded and chartered in the 18th century. In Denmark-Norway Reykjavík was founded the very same year as Östersund on Iceland. Östersund was upon foundation freed from taxes during a 20 years timespan and completely liberated from trade regulations and guild order.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Dental {{treatment}} {{is necessary in}} oncology patients since pre-existing oro-dental disease may influence cancer treatment and prognosis. This study investigated the applicability of two indices in reflecting the actual oral health status of 100 non-cancer patients who were admitted for dental complaints/routine controls. Methods: The radiographic examination results and the decayed, missed, filled teeth score represented the ‘actual oro-dental status’. The simplified oral hygiene index was utilised for oral hygiene determination, and general oral health assessment index was used to establish the self-perceived oral health. Results: No correlation was observed between actual oro-dental status and the simplified oral hygiene index (p = 0. 27), but the relationship between oro-dental status and general oral health assessment index was significant (p = 0. 026). Items 9, 5 and 1 (How often were you concerned about problems with your teeth, gums or dentures? How often <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to eat anything without feeling discomfort? How often did you limit the kinds or amounts of food you eat because of problems with your teeth or dentures?) presented correlation (r = − 0. 285, r = 0. 268, and r = − 0. 248). Conclusion: Three items of GOHAI (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index) {{may be used to}} identify the requisite of dental treatment in patients and to aid in immediate dental treatment planning...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{effectiveness}} of prophylaxis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) {{continues to be the}} most common serious opportunistic infection among HIV-infected persons. We describe factors associated with nonadherence to primary PCP prophylaxis. We used 2000 - 2004 data from the Supplement to HIV/AIDS Surveillance (SHAS) project, a cross-sectional interview project of HIV-infected persons >or= 18 years conducted in 18 states. We limited the analysis to persons who denied having prior PCP, reported having a current prescription to prevent PCP, and answered the question "In the past 30 days, how often <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to take the PCP medication(s) exactly the way your doctor told you to take them?" We used multivariable logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Of 1, 666 subjects prescribed PCP prophylaxis, 305 (18. 3 %) were nonadherent. Persons {{were more likely to be}} nonadherent if they reported using marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 1 - 2. 4), non-injection drugs other than marijuana (aOR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 2. 1), or injection drugs (aOR = 2. 3, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 4. 1) in the past year; their mental health was "not good" for >or= 1 day during the past month (aOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 2. 2); their most recent CD 4 count was < 200 cells/microL (aOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 2. 2); or taking ART usually (aOR = 9. 6, 95 % CI = 6. 7 - 13. 7) or sometimes/rarely/never (aOR = 18. 4, 95 % CI = 11. 1 - 30. 4), compared with always, as prescribed. Providers should inquire about and promote strategies to improve adherence to PCP prophylaxis, particularly among persons who use illicit drugs, have mental health issues, and who are not compliant with ART to reduce the occurrence of PCP...|$|E

40|$|Dates: 2001 - 2007 Locations: Las Vegas/San Francisco/New Orleans Supporting Institution: {{funding for}} the project has been {{provided}} by Bowdoin College These photographs come from a long-term and ongoing project concerned with how we perceive and are affected by changes in the places we inhabit. New Orleans finds itself in a precarious position relative to the “natural” demands of its geographic location. Eighty {{percent of the city}} was flooded in 2005; as many of us now realize, most of the city is located below the level of the water that borders it. Due to where it is physically located, in 50 years New Orleans will most likely look nothing like it does today. Coincident to or perhaps because of its location, New Orleans has developed an identity that represents a diversion from the cultural norms associated with mainstream America. Known as the Big Easy for the ease with which musicians could find work, it displays front and center its difference from the rest of America during its celebration of Mardi Gras. What should be an obvious truth, that a place’s physical location and features have a profound affect on the lives and outlooks of its inhabitants, is often overlooked. Saying we live “in” a place, rather than “on” or “with” it, concedes how entirely a place encompasses us physically. It acknowledges the pervasive affect the place’s external imperatives have upon our psyches, our perceptions of self and others, and the desires we pursue. Now that popular consensus is embracing the fact that our world is growing warmer, the uncertain futures this city faces today may well be a harbinger of change facing the places we all live in. Has a sequence of events already been set in motion that will irrevocably alter how and where all of us will be able to live? And if so, how will this fact affect how we relate {{to each other and to}} the places we inhabit?These photographs describe relationships between elements in the landscape that are specific to a particular day, hour, and fraction of a second. What is important to keep in mind is that each triptych presented here comprises a series of individual and distinct photographs. Each individual “frame” within the triptych is its own point in time and each corresponds to a distinct piece of film that I exposed. Taking in the scene presented by the triptych is analogous to how each of us encounters a prospect. By pausing slightly and regularly we set into motion a mental “imagining” in order to see things more completely. I hope each piece’s particularity, its reference to a specific location in time as well as space, stimulates speculation about how different that place appears at this very moment, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> to behold it for yourself. And more exciting is to ponder what it might look like tomorrow, next month, and 50 years hence...|$|E
