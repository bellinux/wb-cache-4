[...] In a more recent interview, Raymond Wong revealed that The Great Master is currently in development. Wong Kar-wai's Ip Man film, titled The Grandmaster, was released on 8 January 2013 in China.|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. <b>We</b> <b>changed</b> some scenes, we added new sequences, <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E

Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: [...] "Before, we got one guitar sound that <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> a little bit through the record. This time {{we want to try}} a whole different setup for each song." [...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as the}} first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with Box Car Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ramones {{began playing}} gigs in mid-1974, {{with their first}} show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, {{performing}} in a style {{similar to the one}} used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of Hit Parader and Rock Scene, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist Joey Ramone related that [...] "Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> her life, She started writing about us in Rock Scene, and then Lenny Kaye would write about us and we started getting more press like The Village Voice. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down." [...] Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band [...] "had everything [...] ever liked," [...] and became the manager in November 1975.|$|E
500|$|Tala (meaning [...] "Stalking Wolf") (voiced by Rose McGowan): The game's second female protagonist. Tala is a Native American shaman and a power-hungry Darkwatch agent. When she was young, Tala {{lost her}} seer mother {{and became an}} outcast from her own tribe, fearful of her mediumship abilities. Her father was then killed by a band of fur traders and she herself was kidnapped and abused by them, until her captors were killed by vampires. Tala was then herself rescued by the Darkwatch troops, who turned her into one of their own. However, her {{experiences}} made her extremely bitter, and she began pursuing ever more power at any cost, secretly desiring to get revenge upon {{the world for the}} death of her parents. Despite her ruthlessness, Tala quickly rose through the Darkwatch ranks due to her fearless battle efficiency. The developers described her as not evil but [...] "just ambitious". Tala is the only character who uses kicks in the game, due to the artists deciding that [...] "some of the combat moves the actress performed fit the character so well that <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> the combat system she's using." [...] If fought as the final boss, she turns into a demon. According to GameSpy, Tala is [...] "without question, the more difficult boss to battle." ...|$|E

500|$|Anna in {{particular}} and the whole film in general had undergone a number {{of changes in the}} story, most notably making the heroine the younger sister of the Snow Queen. Describing the character's development process, director Jennifer Lee admitted, [...] "Even with Anna there was a tug of war for a long time. There are elements of it that we didn't land on with Anna until late into production, so <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> some of the animation to support it." [...] Bell generally described her character as [...] "She doesn't have good postures, she's not very elegant, but she's a good person and she's utterly determined." [...] Lee added, [...] "She doesn't have any superpowers, but Anna is one of these ordinary people doing an extraordinary thing." [...] Contrary to her sister Elsa who represents fear, Anna represents love, she is filled with optimism with an extraordinary heart. Director Chris Buck later stated, [...] " [...] secret weapon is love," [...] while head of story Paul Briggs commented that she is [...] "a character who is willing to stand beside you and stand up for what's right. Her sister was born with a condition that's shaped a world where Anna doesn't belong."

500|$|In February 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Arkham Knight had received a [...] "Mature" [...] rating from the ESRB, rather than the [...] "Teen" [...] ratings previous installments in the franchise held.

But that doesn't mean <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> our approach. We're not including gratuitous blood or swearing. We want to deliver a true end with no compromises, and it takes us to some dark places." [...] Although he did not elaborate which content in particular triggered the [...] "M" [...] rating, Hill did note that a [...] "ratings analysis" [...] by Warner Bros. indicated that the content of certain [...] "key" [...] scenes in the game could affect its rating. The team decided to maintain the offending content so that it would not [...] "jeopardize" [...] their vision for the game and its thematics. In an in-depth explanation of the game's content, the ESRB revealed the existence of scenes where players can [...] "shoot unarmed characters and a hostage", and torture scenes taking place on a [...] "bloody operating table" [...] as well as using a vehicle's wheel.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range.

500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when <b>we</b> <b>changed</b> the body with the actor." ...|$|E
