50|$|This episode {{marked the}} last regular {{appearances}} of Scott Wilson (Hershel) and David Morrissey (The Governor), whose characters were killed {{off during the}} prison assault in the episode. On the decision to kill Hershel, Robert Kirkman explained:He was the moral compass {{of the group and}} it’s always good to lose the moral compass. It will all become clear when we finally show you the back half of season 4. It wasn’t enough for these characters to lose the prison. They also had to feel some kind of loss over something important and Hershel was that thing that was important to each and every character, so it made the most sense to take him off the table and see how it affects the characters, which we’ll see <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a bit. So there’s a lot of cool stuff ahead because of that.Kirkman admitted it was difficult to remove Wilson from the cast, despite initially planning to kill off Hershel {{at the end of the}} second season, but admitted it was a necessary decision in order to move on with the show:I've been killing people on The Walking Dead since before there was a TV show. It was never a big deal, but it is really starting to wear on me personally. It's tough knowing that I'm going to go to set next year and Scott's not going to be there. That's kind of screwed up. It's getting to the point where I want to be in the writer's room and be like 'You know what, let's not kill anybody. Let's not do that anymore.' It's pretty terrible, but it is what it is. You gotta kill people to make the show work.During the climax of the episode, The Governor is about to kill Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) when The Governor is mortally wounded by Michonne (Danai Gurira) and later shot in the head by Lilly Chambler (Audrey Marie Anderson), who incidentally also kills him in the comics. Kirkman explained the reason behind Lilly - The Governor's lover, being the one to kill The Governor:In that moment Lilly is very angry with the Governor because she had in the episode prior said, “Let’s not do this. We don’t have to go after this other place.” And she was very much against everything that the Governor was doing and to a certain extent didn’t even see why he was doing it because she didn’t know that burning vengeance that was in the Governor or that desire to control and to have the prison. I think the Governor ultimately hated that there was this group out there that was existing without him and was possibly doing better than him, and it was eating away at him. So I definitely think in that moment when she shot him, she despised him quite a bit. I do think there was a lot of hatred behind that bullet.|$|E
40|$|When {{change is}} happening, {{communities}} talk and some tales get taller in the telling. Opinions are {{often based on}} shared stories and collectively these opinions are the community sentiment that affects the way people live and act. This magazine was produced by a collaboration between the ECU Journalism Program and the Shire of Ashburton that set out to track the shifts in the community sentiment in Onslow over the construction phase of the Wheatstone and Macedon gas hubs. The project aims to capture the stories being told in Onslow as the town changes, regardless of their factual accuracy. Where possible we have sought to verify facts and provide balance, {{but we have not}} excluded comments by community members {{on the grounds that they}} didn 2 ̆ 7 t check out, because if we did that, then this would not be an accurate record of what people are saying. In all cases we have been careful to correctly report what people said in our interviews. The result is a sometimes optimistic and sometimes disgruntled reaction to the town 2 ̆ 7 s rapid, but in some ways not rapid enough, growth spurt. We hope that you enjoy this snapshot of what was being said in Onslow in the middle of 2013 and find it interesting food for thought about the impact of major resource projects on their host communities. There is a digital version of the magazine available on the website so you can email a link to it to your family and friends in other places. The website also has soon-to-be updated galleries showing how parts of the town have changed almost beyond recognition and video interviews with Onslow locals. We look forward to seeing you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> early 2014...|$|E

40|$|Onslow, {{the town}} and {{community}} you live in, is in {{for a lot of}} changes over the next few years. Gas projects will bring new faces, while many old faces are leaving, and new money will buy new things. Will this mean that Onslow loses some of it’s ramshackle, rustic charm? Will it attract hordes of new tourists who’ll crowd out the old crew? Maybe, maybe not — either way {{we want to know what}} you think. This project is a collaboration between the journalism program at Edith Cowan University and the Shire of Ashburton and it’s all about tracking your views and opinions over time as the changes roll out. We’ll be visiting Onslow every six months over the next few years and sitting down with as many of you as we can, to listen to what you have to say about what’s happening in your town. Your voices are important because you make up the community, and this is your history in the making. Our first visit was in July 2012. Journalism students Claire Ottaviano, Aine Ryan and Jasmine Amis came to Onslow with me and we interviewed, recorded and photographed as much of the town as we could. This magazine is the first document produced by the Tracking Onslow Project. We’ll do another in six month’s time. In the meantime we are working on a website that will include more photos and videos, that will also grow over time—providing a record of the community evolving. It’s not only for Onslow to be able to look back on—but also so the rest of Australia can see the impacts of major resource projects on the communities that accommodate them. We look forward to seeing you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> February 2013...|$|E
