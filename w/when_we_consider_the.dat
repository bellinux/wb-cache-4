The position of the packet {{is defined by the}} distance on the trajectory s=s(t) which it has travelled by time t. In reality, however, the trajectory is the outcome of the balance of forces upon the particle. In this section we assume to know it from the start for convenience of representation. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> motion determined by the forces selected next, we will have clues of which type of trajectory fits the particular balance of forces.|$|E

The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E
