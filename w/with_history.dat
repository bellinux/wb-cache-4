We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|Father (1966) is {{a coming}} of age story that {{displays}} Szabó’s increasing fascination <b>with</b> <b>history</b> and memory. The main character copes with the childhood loss of his father {{against the backdrop of}} the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and memories of the Arrow Cross dictatorship. The film won the Grand Prix at the 5th Moscow International Film Festival and the Special Jury Prize at Locarno, and established Szabó as the most internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker of his time, as well as an auteur in the European film tradition. In 2000, Father appeared as number 11 on a list of the 12 best Hungarian films according to a group of Hungarian film critics.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that Darvin may be {{attempting}} to assassinate Kirk, the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the Enterprise. They attempt to interact <b>with</b> <b>history</b> {{as little as}} possible whilst investigating Darvin. The crew does not initially recognize the Klingons of the time period, and when Worf (Michael Dorn) is asked about the difference in appearance, he replies that the matter is not discussed with outsiders. Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) get involved in a bar brawl between the Enterprise crew and a number of Klingons on shore leave. Captain Kirk disciplines them on the Enterprise alongside Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). Bashir and O'Brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles. Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) and Odo (René Auberjonois) detain Darvin and return him to the Defiant. There, Darvin admits that he planted a bomb in a tribble to kill Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: {{the north and west}} of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} much beyond the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty {{has more to do with}} the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than <b>with</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society <b>with</b> <b>history,</b> technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{distance between}} the two civilizations has also been {{used to assess the}} cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, {{is likely to be the}} most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter. Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies <b>with</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply <b>with</b> <b>history.</b> However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of who it is. The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He leaves them on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out quietly as the family mourns Pompeii. The Doctor comments to Donna that she was right - he does need someone to stop him.|$|E

40|$|Women <b>with</b> a <b>history</b> {{of abuse}} often have {{difficulty}} escaping abusive relationships. One potential factor {{that may influence}} this behavior is inappropriate sensitivity to delayed or diffused outcomes. The purpose {{of this research was}} to obtain measurements of sensitivity to delayed consequences in women <b>with</b> <b>histories</b> of abuse. Participants engaged in a hypothetical money choice task to determine the relative subjective value of delayed rewards. A quantitative model relating delay to subjective value was fit to each the data. Based upon comparison with data previously reported in the literature, women <b>with</b> <b>histories</b> ofabuse discount delayed rewards to a lesser degree than the general population. Women <b>with</b> <b>histories</b> ofabuse may be less impulsive and show signs of hypersensitivity to long-term outcomes. This may contribute to the individual sustaining an abusive relationship in hopes that the relationship will prove beneficial in the long run...|$|R

METHOD: Unmedicated euthymic women <b>with</b> a <b>history</b> of major depression and matched comparison subjects <b>with</b> no <b>history</b> of depression were given a facial expression recognition task following intravenous infusion of saline or citalopram (10 mg) in a double-blind, between-group design. RESULTS: Following saline infusion, subjects <b>with</b> a previous <b>history</b> of depression showed a selectively greater recognition of fear relative to the subjects <b>with</b> no <b>history</b> of depression. The abnormal fear processing observed in the subjects <b>with</b> a previous <b>history</b> of depression was normalized following citalopram infusion, an effect that was opposite to that seen with the subjects <b>with</b> no <b>history</b> of depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased recognition of fear is a trait vulnerability marker for depression {{and that this is}} normalized following a single dose of citalopram...|$|R
