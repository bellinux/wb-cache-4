5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
500|$|From {{the second}} episode onwards, a {{secondary}} opening sequence runs immediately {{after an initial}} teaser: as the Mysterons announce their latest threat against Earth, the [...] "Mysteron rings" [...] pass over the primary puppet cast {{in a number of}} environments to demonstrate the aliens' omnipresence. Meanwhile, the characters's Spectrum code names are flashed up on-screen. The Mysterons invariably begin their threat with the words, [...] "This is the voice of the Mysterons. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can hear us, Earthmen." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. ... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot {{come all the way}} to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. ... We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, {{there is}} a drift a mile lower down. It is a bad one, but we managed to get across. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were alone, and as you seemed {{determined}} to remain here, we made sure of getting you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We don't {{want your}} friendship, Dan Baxter, so there!" [...] cried Nellie. [...] "We know your past, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot be trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only, Papa,' said Felix frankly, 'that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and he {{will get}} into some Church talk, and then you'll be of no use; {{and we wanted to}} have it all to ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!"

60|$|Arabel {{would have}} gone to tell you all this a {{fortnight}} since, but one of my brothers has been ill with fever which was not exactly typhus, but of the typhoid character, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would rather not see her under the circumstances. He is very much better (it is Octavius), and has been out of bed to-day and yesterday.|$|R
40|$|Dear Douglas: We were {{so pleased}} {{to find your}} letter when we reached home last night. It was the first word that we had had since your {{telegram}} of last Tuesday, saying <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had lost your seat on the plane, and while <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must have arrived safely or {{we would have been}} notified, still we were very curious as to when and how...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may be true}} enough," [...] Mr. Hertman said, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> stole {{them all}} in the first place--that you {{yourself}} stole them, and put the blame on your unfortunate cashier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] she sighed; [...] "but {{it will be}} {{very hard}} to be taking our ease down at Weymouth while <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are, day after day, wearing {{yourself}} out in tramping about making inquiries." ...|$|E
60|$|Another. One of {{them said}} (I think it was Justice Blundale, or Justice Snagg), How should <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not write out your prayers first, and then read them {{afterwards}} to the people? This he spake in a laughing way.|$|E
60|$|PRES. Else <b>we</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} seized, {{and we will}} burst our way in, drag you from his guards.|$|R
6000|$|... "We heard a woman scream twice, once {{far away}} and once near at hand, and rowing to the sound, saw someone hanging to the arm of an {{overturned}} windmill {{only three or four}} feet above the water. Of course <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had been taken to the mill; that man there told us. Do you remember him? But at first we could not find it in the darkness and the flood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} it seems," [...] she interrupted, [...] "to {{careless}} observers. But <b>we</b> know--we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have lived--a great deal--for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{quite know}} what you are saying, lad?" [...] the former said kindly, after a pause. [...] "You don't look as if you had been taking {{anything}} before dinner, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are always abstemious at mess; still you are talking strangely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Mister Woodchuck, [...] "there {{are some}} things that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't; and {{although}} a woodchuck might not be of much account in one of your schoolrooms, you must forgive me for saying that I think you'd make a mighty poor woodchuck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am glad {{indeed that}} you are out," [...] Walter said. [...] "Every time the mortar sent a shell into the town, I was {{thinking}} of you, and wishing that I could share meals with you, for, of course, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are suffering horribly in the town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It did {{not even}} occur to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would have called upon Count Platurn, my cousin. I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might be {{detained}} at Prague, but Vienna is the last place where we should have pictured <b>you.</b> Had <b>we</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had been sent to}} Spielberg, I think we should have given up all hope of seeing you again, until you were exchanged; for I have heard that {{it is one of the}} strongest of the Austrian fortresses.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{did your}} very best for him. He has said so {{himself when he}} has written. But you;--you have been fortunate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think,' said Albinia, kindly, 'that <b>we</b> do <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had some}} {{troubles}} on that score. Old nurse {{said something to}} Sophy, but no other creature knows it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{say that}} you have been calling on people who know you," [...] one of the magistrates began; [...] "and as I told you the other day <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been {{wandering}} about the country in a strange way, I now requite that you shall tell us the names of all the persons with whom you have had communication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John Carter," [...] he answered, [...] "if ever you and Dejah Thoris {{escape the}} Tharks {{it will be}} upon this journey. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will not go without her. You have shown {{yourself}} a mighty fighter, {{and we do not}} wish to manacle you, so we hold you both in the easiest way that will yet ensure security. I have spoken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inkosazana, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have come}} to love this girl. Therefore, {{yesterday}} before we spoke with you we seized her as we were commanded, and hid her away, awaiting your answer to our message. Had you consented to visit the King at his Great Place, we would have let her go. But as you did not consent my companions have taken her to the King." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louis, {{you were}} dying there. Pray, pray listen to me. We thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were dying; and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> also <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would be taken}} from that house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{where have}} you been, Master Cyril?" [...] Nellie broke in. [...] "What has {{happened}} to you? We have been picturing all sorts of horrors, mother and I. That evil had befallen you we were sure, for <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would not go away of a sudden, in this fashion, {{without so much as}} saying goodbye. We feared all the more when, two days afterwards, the wretches were so bold as to attack the constables, and to rescue Robert Ashford and another from their hands. Men who would do this in broad daylight would surely hesitate at nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{leave the}} {{question}} of ladies and come to matters {{that have to do}} with men. You are here as we told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be at a time when you did not believe us, and we here to meet you, as we told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we would be. How <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were coming and how we came do not matter at all. Believe what you will. Are you ready to start with us, O Lord Macumazana, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may bring to its death the wicked elephant Jana which ravages our land, and receive the great reward of ivory? If so, your camel waits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Northman drew a long breath. 'Well, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> English are gentlemen. But let us {{speak the}} truth. Why should {{we love you}} so very much? You haven't done {{anything}} to be loved. We don't love the other people, of course. They haven't done anything for that either. A fellow comes along {{with a bag of}} gold... I haven't been in Rotterdam my last voyage for nothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, Ned," [...] a comrade said to {{him when}} the list was {{published}} and his name {{was found to be}} absent. [...] "It is not always those that most deserve the cross who get it. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought to have had it, if any fellow ever did, and we shall think just as much of you as if you had got it on your breast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of King Amuba, son of King Phrases and lawful ruler of the Rebu, I, Jethro his general, summon you to surrender. The usurper Amusis is dead and the whole land has risen against you. Our force is overpowering--resistance can only result {{in the death of}} every Egyptian under your orders. Did we choose we could starve you out, for <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no more than a week's {{provisions}} in your magazines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a Tory, Bullen; {{but people}} change, you <b>know.</b> I hope <b>we</b> shall never see among {{the lists of}} Nihilists tried for sedition and conspiracy, and sentenced to execution, {{the name of one}} Godfrey Bullen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George! I {{should think}} so.--Kate, why don't you come out? Come along, my girl. Medlicot has spoken out openly, {{and you should}} answer him in the same fashion." [...] So saying, he dragged her forth, and I fear that, {{as far as she}} was concerned, {{something}} of the sweetness of her courtship was lost by the publicity with which she was forced to confess her love. [...] "Will you go, Kate, and make sugar down at the mill? I have often thought how bad it would be for Mary and me when you were taken away; but we sha'n't mind it so much if <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are to be near us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, stranger," [...] said Hockins, {{putting his}} musical {{instrument}} in his pocket, [...] "how are <b>we</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a friend--except by the cut o' your jib, which, I admit, looks honest enough, and your actions, which, we can't deny, are peaceable like?" ...|$|R
