Rust <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the few}} monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E

40|$|Tests of Heterodera glycines on {{differential}} host {{plants to}} determine races were run in Arkansas, Illinois, and North Carolina {{to check the}} uniformity of results of the test. Methods used at the three locations varied somewhat. Results indicate that the race test is highly variable. Isolates previously <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 1 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 1 or race 3; those <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 2 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> in these tests as race 2, 4, 9, or 14; those previously <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 3 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 1 or race 3; those <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 4 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> in these tests as race 4 or race 14; those previously <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 5 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 2; and those previously <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 6 <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> race 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.
