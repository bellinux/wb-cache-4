2500|$|The film also sparked {{negative}} reactions {{because of its}} content. [...] "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. [...] "The people {{in charge of the}} power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> who loved Disney and Norman Rockwell, thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me." ...|$|E

Careful viewers could see Joe with his arm around Tom's neck, [...] "strangling" [...] him. The slug in the Miller household, first seen in episode two, is meant to indicate that there is something wrong the Miller family. Joe's visits to the skatepark in episodes three and six indicate not only his link to Danny Latimer but also his desire to be around young boys with whom he could form a relationship similar to the one he had with Danny.|$|E

2500|$|Members of the D.C.

[...] Nothing incriminating was found. Federal authorities decided to make a second visit. Military investigators arrived at about 11:00p.m. on Monday, April 17, to bring Mrs. Surratt and others in for questioning. As they were about to depart at 11:45p.m., Powell showed up on the doorstep. Powell claimed to be a menial laborer who'd been hired that morning by Mrs. Surratt to dig a gutter in the street. He explained his arrival at the house by saying that he wanted to know what time he should begin <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> His clothes aroused intense suspicion, as he wore rather good quality boots, pants, dress shirt, vest, and coat. His pickaxe seemed unused, and his hands were uncalloused and well manicured (unlike those of a common laborer). Mrs. Surratt denied knowing him. (She would later claim that her extremely poor eyesight and the darkness of the room prevented her from recognizing Powell. Powell stood under a bright lamp just five feet from her when she made her denial.) ...|$|E
