40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the world has seen a {{significant}} {{rise in the number}} of refugees due to wars and conflicts, making war, conflicts and the increasing number of refugees a global concern. Before entering a host country, refugees often live in camps, with limited health care resources, inadequate food and water, and no access to education. Refugee <b>women</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>experienced</b> sexual violence, gender-based discrimination, and reproductive health problems. Resettled refugees often know little to nothing about their medical needs until a health assessment is done upon their arrival in their host country. Refugees face many challenges during their first year of resettlement, including language barriers, adapting to new culture and context, and difficulty accessing health care services. Despite significant strides made by the Canadian government towards providing refugees adequate health care services, health care disparities continue to persist between this population and the general population of a Canada. This study reveals the experiences of refugee women’s access to health care services during their first year of resettlement in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, between 2014 and 2015. This analysis examines the lives of eight post-migration refugee women from Somalia and Eritrea who arrived in Saskatoon and accessed heath care services there through the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). The IFHP serves as the primary government program that provides limited and temporary health care benefits to protected persons, including refugees and refugee claimants. Contextually, the study took place after the 2012 cuts to the IFHP were restored in 2014. In order to understand how these refugees access health care services, three health care providers and four resettlement agency representatives were interviewed. The study was conducted within the theoretical framework of intersectionality. Data collected through interviews were analyzed and interpreted through a social constructionist epistemological lens, employing an inductive thematic analysis approach. The findings revealed mixed experiences and perceptions regarding refugee access to health care services. The results also show the various ways health service providers and resettlement agencies interpret and deliver health care services to refugees. Refugees are perceived to have experienced many difficulties during their transition and upon entry to Canada. Some refugees may be unaware of the variety of health care services in Canada as these services may differ from those provided in their country of origin. Language, transportation, cultural factors, and discrimination and racism also impede refugees’ access to health care. Perceived discrimination and racism was an interesting finding that emerged from this study. The study’s results could not establish if there were actual experiences of discrimination and racism, or the refugee women did not understand how the Canadian health system operates. The study found that health service providers and resettlement agencies’ representatives shared their experiences and perceptions regarding health care services for refugees and that their services were largely appreciated by the refugee women interviewed; however, much remains to be done in the provision of accessible services. Overall, the study is intended to assist in informing programs and policies in that will help refugees in their access to health care services during the first year of resettlement...|$|R
50|$|As {{is true in}} Western societies, {{depression}} is much more prevalent in women than in men in collective cultures. However, women from collective cultures also tend to experience more gender discrimination than Western women. They are traditionally expected to protect their honor at all costs and fulfill domestic roles. The stresses of these tasks alone are often overwhelming. Due to their inferior positions in the culture, <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> domestic violence, poverty, and blatant inequality that can greatly contribute to depression.|$|E
50|$|In human sexuality, the {{refractory}} period {{is usually the}} recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible {{for a man to}} have additional orgasms due to increase in the penile sensory threshold (PST).

50|$|Infection with M. genitalium {{sometimes}} produces clinical symptoms, or {{a combination}} of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases, including endometritis and salpingitis. <b>Women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> bleeding after sex and it is also suspected with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis. Polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. Unlike other Mycoplasma, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. It is also suspected {{to play a role in}} the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|A vaginal yeast {{infection}} results from overgrowth of candida albicans, or yeast, in the vagina. This is a relatively common infection, with over 75% of women having experienced at least one {{yeast infection}} {{at some point in}} their life. Risk factors for yeast infections include recent antibiotic use, diabetes, immunosuppression, increased estrogen levels, and use of certain contraceptive devices including intrauterine devices, diaphragms, or sponges. It is not a sexually transmitted infection. Candida vaginal infections are common; an estimated 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime. Vaginal discharge is not always present in yeast infections, but when occurring it is typically odorless, thick, white, and clumpy. Vaginal itching is the most common symptom of candida vulvovaginitis. <b>Women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> burning, soreness, irritation, pain during urination, or pain during sex. The diagnosis of Candida vulvovaginitis is made by looking at a sample taken from the vagina under the microscope that shows hyphae (yeast), or from a culture. It is important to note that the symptoms described above may be present in other vaginal infections, so microscopic diagnosis or culture is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with intra-vaginal or oral anti-fungal medications.|$|E

5000|$|Studies of the {{conditions}} of segregation, and interviews with {{the women who are}} subjected to them, have shown that <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement. Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self. Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time. The Fire Inside magazine, written by offenders in California women’s prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.” ...|$|E
40|$|Background. In urban India, {{working women}} are {{expected}} to continue to discharge their traditional domestic duties; the likely result is compromised well-being due to role strain. Husbands of working <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> pressures and hence poorer well-being. Well-being in working couples, particularly husbands, is little researched in developing countries. Method. The Subjective Well-Being Inventory was administered to 46 ’one-work-ing ’ (only husband employed) and 51 ’both-working ’ (both spouses employed) randomly selected urban, middle-class couples. Results. In one-working as well as both-working families, wives experienced less well-being than their husbands. Working wives experienced more confidence in coping than non-working wives. Husbands in both-working families experienced better social support but less social contact, less mental mastery, and poorer perceived health than husbands in one-working families. Few or no sociodemo-graphic variables were associated with well-being. Conclusions. Employment may benefit women but stress their husbands...|$|E
30|$|The levonorgestrel-containing {{intra-uterine}} contraceptive system (Mirena IUS) is used {{to treat}} women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). The reported oligomenorrhoea rates range from 75 % to 91 % [1, 2], and the amenorrhoea rate in a randomised controlled trial was 36 % [3]. However, the device {{may have to be}} removed prematurely {{for a variety of reasons}} in as many as 57 % of users [4]. This may be due to progestogenic side effects, such as weight gain, greasy skin, acne and breast tenderness, and <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> pelvic pain and irregular vaginal bleeding. Previous studies have reported that most treatment failures requiring removal of the device occur during the initial 3 – 6  months [5]. In order to determine the proportion of women who have the device removed over time, a survival analysis on a cohort of patients who had the Mirena IUS fitted to treat DUB was carried out. The indications for removal of the device and the patient’s menstrual status were also quantified.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Q fever is a {{bacterial}} zoonosis caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii. It {{is well established}} that Q fever causes fetal loss in small ruminants. The suspicion has been raised that pregnant <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> adverse pregnancy outcome when the infection is acquired or reactivated during pregnancy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the potential association between serologic markers of infection with C. burnetii and spontaneous abortion. METHODS: A nested case-control study within the Danish National Birth Cohort, a cohort of 100, 418 pregnancies recruited from 1996 - 2002. Women were recruited in first trimester of pregnancy and followed prospectively. Median gestational age at enrolment was 8 weeks (25 and 75 percentiles: 7 weeks; 10 weeks). During pregnancy, a blood sample was collected at gestational week 6 - 12 and stored in a bio bank. For this study, a case sample of 218 pregnancies was drawn randomly among the pregnancies in the cohort which ended with a miscarriage before 22 gestational weeks, and a reference group of 482 pregnancies was selected in a random fashion among all pregnancies in the cohort. From these pregnancies, serum samples were screened for antibodies against C. burnetii in a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that proved IgG or IgM antibody positive were subsequently confirmatory tested by an immunofluorescence (IFA) test. RESULTS: Among cases, 11 (5 %) were C. burnetii positive in ELISA of which one was confirmed in the IFA assay compared to 29 (6 %) ELISA positive and 3 IFA confirmed in the random sample. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a higher prevalence of C. burnetii antibodies in serum samples from women who later miscarried and the present study does not indicate a major association between Q fever infection and spontaneous abortion in humans. Very early first trimester abortions were, however, not included in the study...|$|E
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} weight loss {{concerns}} {{of young adults}} with type 1 diabetes. BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are prevalent in young women with type 1 diabetes. DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: Interviews with 35 young adults (23 - 30 years of age) with type 1 diabetes and 13 healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Most female interviewees {{were concerned about the}} difficulties of losing weight when having diabetes. Six female interviewees developed severe eating disturbances when they were younger. These women initially regarded their disturbed eating behaviour positively and engaged in weight loss activities intermittently. However, over time, they lost control of their behaviour, and it came to dominate their lives. Family conflict often intensified disordered eating behaviours. Eventually all of these women managed to transition away from their behaviour, although this process took, for some of them, several years. Several of them (now in their early to late twenties), however, continued to struggle with weight loss impulses. Healthcare professionals felt that eating- and weight-related issues often went undiagnosed and undocumented in young adult women with type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Many young women with type 1 diabetes are worried about their weight, but will not engage in risky weight loss activities because of concerns about their health. A minority of young adult women will develop more severe eating-related disturbances. These eating disturbances may last a significant amount of time before clinicians become aware of them. These <b>women</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> disordered weight loss impulses for sometime after clinical interventions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinicians should screen young adult women with type 1 diabetes for eating disorders and monitor young adult women who have developed eating disorders over the longer term. There may be a need to provide asymptomatic young women with diabetes with information about the potential risks of insulin omission...|$|E
