It is {{believed}} that the actual names came after an heated Prodan's answer referring to an eventual Sumo break-up: [...] ""Are <b>we</b> <b>breaking</b> up, you say? Bollocks we are!""; hence Divididos (Spanish for [...] "The Divided") and Las Pelotas (Spanish for [...] "Bollocks").|$|R
500|$|Pikes Hotel is {{a luxury}} hotel, set in a 15th-century stone mansion, a finca, which was a farm for centuries. It is {{accessed}} off a long lane leading from the main road from Sant Antoni de Portmany. Stuart Husband of The Independent describes Pikes Hotel as [...] "a notorious Ibiza hotel where anything goes." [...] It {{is considered to be}} one of the most famous or infamous hotels on the island and has been cited as one of the [...] "world's true spiritual homes of rock'n'roll hedonism." [...] Iain Stewart of The Rough Guide to Ibiza considers Pikes Hotel to be an [...] "almost legendary, relaxed and idiosyncratic rural hotel, popular with visiting celebrities." [...] The Mail on Sunday has referred to the hotel as an [...] "atmosphere of complete sexual licence." [...] Anthony Pike himself said [...] "it's been claimed <b>we</b> <b>break</b> every law, but I wouldn't be in business if that was the case." [...] Boy George referred to Pike as the [...] "Hugh Hefner of Ibiza".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that [...] "it would be cool {{to be in a}} club, and we're dorky waitresses, and <b>we</b> <b>break</b> out and start dancing." [...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." [...] Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she [...] "came to the set completely rehearsed." [...] The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999.|$|E
500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when <b>we</b> <b>break</b> His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us {{that we need to}} repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claims one of {{the goals}} of its {{insurgency}} is to reverse the effects of the Sykes–Picot Agreement. [...] "This is not the first border <b>we</b> will <b>break,</b> <b>we</b> will <b>break</b> other borders," [...] a jihadist from the ISIL warned in a video titled End of Sykes-Picot. ISIL's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a July 2014 speech at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, vowed that [...] "this blessed advance will not stop until we hit the last nail in the coffin of the Sykes–Picot conspiracy".|$|R

2500|$|Hankey met French and Wilson on 24 October {{and urged}} them to reconsider, {{concerned}} that if Robertson resigned the Conservatives might bring down the government. French refused, saying Haig was [...] "always making the same mistake" [...] and [...] "we shall do no good until <b>we</b> <b>break</b> down the Haig-Robertson ring". Hankey thought that [...] "there was envy, hatred and malice in the old boy's heart as he spoke". Haig regarded French's paper as [...] "the outcome of a jealous and disappointed mind".|$|E

2500|$|The terms [...] and [...] {{stem from}} Greek, meaning [...] "to take apart" [...] and [...] "to put together," [...] respectively. These terms {{are used in}} many {{scientific}} disciplines, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. Analysis is defined as [...] "the procedure by which <b>we</b> <b>break</b> down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts," [...] while synthesis means [...] "the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole." [...] System analysis researchers apply methodology to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{previous}} day, Neil Kinnock {{had told the}} party not to [...] "scorn legality", but the General Secretary of NUPE Rodney Bickerstaffe responded when moving composite 42 that the required cuts would force councils to break statutory obligations: [...] "The question is not should <b>we</b> <b>break</b> the law, but which law shall we obey?". When summing up the debate {{on behalf of the}} NEC, David Blunkett (Leader of rate-capped Sheffield City Council) did not make clear that the NEC asked for composite 43 to be remitted, meaning withdrawn for further consideration. On a show of hands from those in the hall, the NEC statement and both composites were carried. The result, supporting illegal budgeting, dismayed the party leadership.|$|E

5000|$|Riddle has {{defended the}} Texas House's unwritten policy to cast votes for absent and indisposed {{members on the}} basis that members of the {{legislature}} often do not get breaks to tend to any other business. She was shown on Austin's KEYE-TV voting for State Representative Edmund Kuempel. She has defended the House policy: [...] "We have a lot of votes. We have a lot of amendments, and there's sic times when <b>we</b> don't <b>break</b> for lunch, and <b>we</b> don't <b>break</b> for dinner, <b>we</b> don't have bathroom breaks." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Holy Communion' (or simply 'Communion') {{are used}} by some groups {{originating}} in the Protestant Reformation to mean the entire Eucharistic rite. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements: they speak of receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving Holy Communion. The term [...] "Communion" [...] is derived from Latin communio ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (koinōnía) in : The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which <b>we</b> <b>break,</b> is it not the communion {{of the body of}} Christ?.|$|E
2500|$|The ninth {{track of}} the album is a cover of Animotion's new wave single, [...] "Obsession". Hoffman {{described}} it as [...] "sugary synth pop". The song contains [...] "glittering" [...] chord progressions of a 1980s nightclub. According to Talia Kraines of BBC, the cover is an [...] "almost exact reworking" [...] of the original. This is followed by pop track [...] "Ace Reject", lyrically inspired by dysfunctional relationships. Buchanan spoke of the song's concept and meaning, saying: [...] "It's {{about the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>break</b> up and make up and we don't know why." [...] The UK bonus track, [...] "Better", features an [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] backing vocal and is lyrically about overcoming one's problems. The song was compared to [...] "Thank You" [...] by Jamelia. The album's twelfth and closing track is [...] "2 Hearts", an acoustic-driven pop ballad that incorporates European electropop. The song's instrumentation consists of guitars, horns, beats, bass, percussion and strings. It also features a string grandeur similar to that of Hybrid. The song is reminiscent of [...] "Grace Under Pressure" [...] by Elbow.|$|E
2500|$|Missouri Governor Jay Nixon {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Missouri State Highway Patrol would take over {{policing}} Ferguson from the St. Louis County police, whose tactics were widely criticized, referring to the change as [...] "an operational shift," [...] and that police will use force [...] "only when necessary," [...] and will generally [...] "step back a little bit." [...] Nixon said that Ferguson security will be overseen by Captain Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol. Johnson, an African-American, said he grew up in the community and [...] "it {{means a lot to me}} personally that <b>we</b> <b>break</b> this cycle of violence." [...] Nixon said, [...] "The people of Ferguson want their streets to be free of intimidation and fear" [...] he said, but during the past few days, [...] "it looked a little bit more like a war zone and that's not acceptable." [...] St. Louis county prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch criticized the governor's decision, saying [...] "It's shameful what he did today; he had no legal authority to do that. To denigrate the men and women of the county police department is shameful." ...|$|E
