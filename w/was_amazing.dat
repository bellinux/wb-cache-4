25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, {{has a very}} short run which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it <b>was</b> <b>amazing</b> {{to me that a}} bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, with a tremendous drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E

I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle.
