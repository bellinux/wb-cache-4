A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions {{in preparation for the}} main amphibious landing force.|$|E
5|$|Day and Greene sounded out {{scientists}} and science communicators about their idea, enlisting {{many of their}} contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They met with {{the presidents of the}} city's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears wherever they <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City. Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation (SFF), a non-profit organization based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are Alan Alda, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger, the foundation's president Judith Cox, New York University president John Sexton, and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.|$|E
5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he <b>went</b> <b>and</b> his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E
5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce <b>went</b> <b>and</b> picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E

Khánh's contended that only a full sitting of the Armed Forces Council, him included, had the power to make a leadership change. Khánh told Cao of his intention to resist what he saw as an illegal seizure of power. Having concluded that Khánh would fight to the bitter end, Cao <b>went</b> <b>and</b> saw Westmoreland in an open request for help. Westmoreland sent Rowland to meet with the eight available members of the AFCKỳ, Thi, Cao, Thiệu, Minh, Khang, Có and Phạm Văn Đồngto devise a plan to thwart Khánh’s attempts to reestablish himself.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he <b>went</b> <b>and</b> interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} third waves of castle {{building}} were led by the major magnates, {{and then by the}} more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they <b>went</b> <b>and</b> often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a near-capacity crowd, the {{visitors}} Arsenal began the tie more strongly, {{but failed to}} convert their chances. They took the lead minutes before half-time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match <b>went,</b> <b>and</b> they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. Two minutes later, the home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once the whistle blew for full-time; the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters. Wrexham's reward was a fourth-round tie against West Ham United which they lost in a replay.|$|E

5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we <b>went</b> <b>and</b> bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E
