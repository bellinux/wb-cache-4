40|$|As coral {{restoration}} projects {{become more}} common there are important ecological questions to be addressed, such as the health of outplanted corals {{in relation to the}} natural reef community. Here we examined data from multiple projects to make preliminary comparisons of disease prevalence in wild and outplanted Acropora cervicornis colonies. Data were gathered from a large A. cervicornis demographic monitoring project covering three Florida regions: Broward County (BWD), Middle Keys (MDK) and Dry Tortugas (DRTO) and multiple outplanting projects within BWD. Prevalence of disease was calculated for every monitoring event (annual to monthly) between 2010 and 2015 for each region and all outplant projects. The overall mean colony prevalence of disease per event, all projects combined, was 3. 4 %. Disease was most prevalent during summer months for wild and outplanted populations. MDK <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> had the highest mean prevalence of disease per monitoring event, whereas outplanted colonies had the lowest mean prevalence of disease per event. The highest prevalence of disease for any one event was recorded on <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> in BWD during the Summer 2015 at 18. 5 %. These data indicate that the prevalence of disease in outplanted corals across multiple years and during outbreak events is similar to, if not less than, that recorded across the entire Florida Reef Tract for <b>wild</b> <b>colonies.</b> These data also provide further evidence that outplanted corals respond to stressors similar to <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> and currently are not a significant health risk to wild coral populations...|$|R

40|$|Information {{transfer}} among {{group members}} {{is believed to}} play an important part in the evolution of coloniality in both birds and bats. Although information transfer has received much scientific interest, field studies using experiments to test the underlying hypotheses are rare. We used a field experiment to test if communally breeding female Bechstein's bats (Myotis bechsteinii) exchange information regarding novel roosts. We supplied a <b>wild</b> <b>colony,</b> comprising 17 adult females of known relatedness, with pairs of suitable and unsuitable roosts and monitored the arrival of individuals marked with transponders (PIT-tags) over 2 years. As expected with information transfer, significantly more naive females were recruited towards suitable than towards unsuitable roosts. We conclude that information transfer about roosts has two functions: (i) it generates communal knowledge of a large set of roosts; and (ii) it aids avoidance of colony fission during roost switching. Both functions seem important in Bechstein's bats, in which colonies depend on many day roosts and where colony members live together for many years...|$|E

Locating bumble bee colonies in the field is, however, very difficult because they usually nest underground. In this study, we estimated the number of colonies using genetic data from B. terrestris queens foraging near greenhouses in Biratori, Hokkaido, Japan, applying the Shared Loci Correspondence Analysis (SLCA). Sampled 39 queens were assigned to 30 different families, which indicates that most queens came from different colonies.

This bacterium is the base component of the most important biopesticide used in the control of mosquitoes worldwide. After 54 generations of selection, significant resistance levels were observed. At the beginning of the selection experiment, the half lethal concentration was 26. 3 ng/mL and had risen to 345. 6 ng/mL by generation 54. The highest rate of resistance, 13. 1, was detected in the 54 th generation. Because digestive proteases {{play a key role in}} the processing and activation of B. thuringiensis toxin, we analysed the involvement of insect gut proteases in resistance to the Cry 11 Aa B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis toxin. The protease activity from larval gut extracts from the Cry 11 Aa resistant population was lower than that of the B. thuringiensisserovar israelensis susceptible colony.

We hypothesized that the persistence of these <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> {{is due in part}} to their habits of nesting in small cavities and swarming frequently. We tested this hypothesis by establishing two groups of colonies living either in small hives (42 L) without swarm- control treatments or in large hives (up to 168 L) with swarm-control treatments. We followed the colonies for two years and compared the two groups with respect to swarming frequency, Varroa infesttion rate, disease incidence, and colony survival. Colonies in small hives swarmed more often, had lower Varroa infestation rates, had less disease, and had higher survival compared to colonies in large hives.

40|$|Introduction Eratyrus mucronatus St&# 229;l, 1859 is a wild triatomine vector of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909. However, {{little is}} known {{regarding}} the biology and ecoepidemiology of this triatomine in the Brazilian Amazon. The present study describes the biology of E. mucronatus grown under laboratory conditions and the epidemiological aspects of its natural breeding sites. Methods Five colonies were monitored {{in the field for}} 3 years. Temperature and humidity measurements were taken in the mornings and afternoons at the natural breeding sites, and the behavior and distribution of the nymphs and adults were observed in the <b>wild</b> <b>colony.</b> We also monitored the life cycle under controlled laboratory conditions.

These factors included an active termite nest, a vertebrate for repast, and dry and shaded substrates with temperatures of 24 - 28 &# 176;C and with humidity of 80 - 90 %. A generation was developed in 274 days under these microclimatic conditions in the laboratory. Conclusions The climatic variables described in the field indicate that these environmental parameters have a limiting effect on the dispersal and colonization of E. mucronatus to new environments. In addition, the long period of development to adulthood demonstrates that only one generation can develop per year even under the more favorable laboratory conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{dramatic}} {{success of}} insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in African countries has been countered by the rapid development of pyrethroid resistance in vector mosquitoes {{over the past}} decade. One advantage {{of the use of}} pyrethroids in ITNs is their excito-repellency. Use of the excito-repellency of pyrethroids might be biorational, since such repellency will not induce or delay the development of any physiological resistance. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the mode of insecticide resistance and excito-repellency in pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Methods. Differences in the reactions of 3 major malaria vectors in western Kenya to pyrethroids were compared in laboratory tests. Adult susceptibility tests were performed using World Health Organization (WHO) test tube kits for F 1 progenies of field-collected An. gambiae s. s., An. arabiensis, and An. funestus s. s., and laboratory colonies of An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis. The contact repellency to pyrethroids or permethrin-impregnated LLINs (Olyset® Nets) was evaluated with a simple choice test modified by WHO test tubes and with the test modified by the WHO cone bioassay test. Results: Field-collected An. gambiae s. s., An. arabiensis, and An. funestus s. s. showed high resistance to both permethrin and deltamethrin. The allelic frequency of the point mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel (L 1014 S) in An. gambiae s. s. was 99. 3 - 100 %, while no point mutations were detected in the other 2 species. The frequency of takeoffs from the pyrethroid-treated surface and the flying times without contacting the surface increased significantly in pyrethroid-susceptible An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis colonies and wild An. arabiensis and An. funestus s. s. colonies, while there was no significant increase in the frequency of takeoffs or flying time in the An. gambiae s. s. <b>wild</b> <b>colony.</b> Conclusion: A different repellent reaction was observed in the field-collected An. gambiae s. s. than in An. arabiensis and An. funestus s. s. It might be that resistant mosquitoes governed by knockdown resistance (kdr) loose repellency to pyrethroids, whereas those lacking kdr maintain high repellency irrespective of their possessing metabolic resistance factors to pyrethroids. Further genetic evaluation is required for the demonstration of the above hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|An {{association}} between large proportions of intestinal parasites, particularly trematodes, found in dead emaciateû cornmon loom (Govio immer) and other avian species, suggests that parasites can cause or {{contribute to a}} debilitating proces that results in the demise of wild, fiee-ranging seabirds. Since concurrent etiologies {{can contribute to the}} mortality of seabirds, determination of the temiinal cause of death is a wmplex process, particularly in chronically debilitated birds. Evaluation of the effects of a single etiology helps assess the extmt of its involvement in the death of the birds. One observation reported in dead common loons, the large numbers of Cryptocotyle lingua found in weak birds, suggests that an underlying disease problern may cause impairment of the immune system of the birds that leads to an increased degree of parasitism, causing Mer debilitation. This study intended to replicate the infection caused by C. lingun, an intestinal trematode nomally present in small numbers in adult seabirds that die in good body condition, with no signs of a debilitating disease. Replication of the infection caused by C. lingua was conducted in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed seabirds, specifically doublecrested comorants, Phalacrocorax aunlus. The birds were collected hm a <b>wild</b> <b>colony</b> at 2 weeks of age and raised in captivity until the experimental trial began at 2 months of age. A total of 31 doublecrested cornorants @CC) were divided into 4 different treatment pups: an immunosuppressed/infecteâ group (n= 8), an immunosuppressed/nnon-infected group (n= 7), a non-immunosuppressed/infected group (n= 8) and a non-inimunosuppressed/non-infected group (n= 8). The immunosuppression of the birds involved administration of dexamethasone before and during the experimental infection with C. lingua and was confïnned through evaluation of the cellular and humoral responses. A phytohemagglutinin-P skin test showed that DCC treated with dexarnethasone had an impairecl T ce 11 response (pe 0. 01). A slightly decreased production of antibodies against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) @< 0. 05), and severe lymphoid depletion of the bursaofFabricius in treated DCC (pC 0. 0 1) indicated a detrimental effect on humoral irnmunity caused by dexamethasone. Heterophilia was ah associated with the treatment with dexarnethasone. Infection of the DCC was accomplished by oral administration of large numbers of C. linguu metacercariae. A previous pilot study showed that the administration of metacercariae obtained fkom the fins and tails of fish that inhabit the waters around Prince Edward Island, Canada, successfiilly produces an infection in DCC.

40|$|International audienceAbstractThere is a {{widespread}} belief that <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> of European honeybees have been eradicated in Europe and North America, killed by viruses spread by the introduced ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. In reality, however, several populations of <b>wild</b> <b>colonies</b> of honeybees in Europe and North America are persisting despite exposure to Varroa. To help understand how this is happening, we tested whether the bees {{in one of these}} populations of wild colonies—those living in and around the Arnot Forest (NY, USA) —are genetically distinct from the bees in the nearest managed colonies. We found that the Arnot Forest honeybees are genetically distinct from the honeybees in the two apiaries within 6  km of the forest. Evidently, the population of Arnot Forest honeybees is not supported by a heavy influx of swarms from the nearest managed colonies, which implies that it is self-sustaining. These results suggest that if a closed population of honeybee colonies is allowed to live naturally, it will develop a balanced relationship with its agents of disease. Indeed, it is likely to become well adapted to its local environment as a whole. We suggest four ways to modify beekeeping practices to help honeybees live in greater health...|$|R
