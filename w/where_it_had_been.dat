5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations {{to ensure that they}} would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the {{battalion}} received a number of reinforcements from its associated Militia unit, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment).

He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, {{and again in the}} First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm, which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Spanish Crown reorganised {{the area}} of Honduras into the Provincia de Higueras e Cabo de Honduras ("Province of Higueras and Cape of Honduras"). The western portion, from the Golfo Dulce, now in Guatemala, to the Ulúa valley and Naco, was defined as Higueras; the eastern portion was Honduras, {{including}} Trujillo, the Valley of Olancho, and extending as far as Cape Camarón. Although organised as two territories, it effectively comprised one province, {{often referred to as}} Honduras-Higueras. In 1534, Honduras-Higueras was removed from the jurisdiction of New Spain, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> since the late 1520s, and returned to that of the audiencia of Santo Domingo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided {{to take over the}} entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E

5|$|Pluton {{spent much}} of 1933–1935 in {{dockyard}} hands after finishing her first round of modifications on 27 April 1933. She was refitted four times during this period to add more gunnery equipment and to rectify some of her defects. These included reinforcement of her superstructure <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> damaged by the muzzle blast from her 138mm guns and replacement of her corroded aluminum ladders and booms with steel ones. A high-angle fire-control director for her 75mm guns was added, two of her 75mm gun were converted to powered, remotely controlled mounts, gun shields {{were added to the}} 75mm guns to protect their crews from blast and facilities for another 40 men was installed on her mine deck.|$|E
5|$|The 18th Battalion {{was formed}} in New Zealand in September 1939. After a period of training, in 1940 it {{embarked}} for the Middle East {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division and then, in 1941, on to Greece. It participated in the Battle of Greece and later in the fighting on Crete. Evacuated from Crete, it then fought in the North African Campaign and suffered heavy losses during Operation Crusader. Brought back up to strength, in June 1942 the battalion participated in the breakout of the 2nd New Zealand Division from Minqar Qaim <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> encircled by the German 21st Panzer Division. The following month, the battalion fought in the First Battle of El Alamein.|$|E

5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|The year 1955 saw further {{changes to}} the {{division}} and more changes of assignment for subordinate elements. On 1 January 1955, the 291st Regiment was again assigned to the 75th Infantry Division from the 95th and was subsequently inactivated on 31 January 1955. On 30 January, the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from New Orleans to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The same date saw the relocation of the 379th Regimental headquarters from Hot Springs, Arkansas <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> since 1947, to Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917 Wheeler {{was posted}} to the 76th Army Field Artillery Brigade, {{one of the}} Royal Field Artillery brigades under the direct control of the General Officer Commanding, Third Army. The brigade was then {{stationed}} in Belgium, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> engaged in the Battle of Passchendaele against German troops along the Western Front. There, he was immediately placed in command of an artillery battery, replacing a major who had been poisoned by mustard gas. Being promoted {{to the rank of}} acting major, {{he was part of the}} Left Group of artillery covering the advancing Allied infantry in the battle. Throughout, he maintained correspondences with his wife, his sister Amy, and his parents. After the Allied victory in the battle, the brigade was transferred to Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> beaten by BBC One on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E
