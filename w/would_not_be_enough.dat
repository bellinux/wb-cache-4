5|$|The Allies had {{previously}} employed several deceptions against the region (for example Operation Hardboiled in 1942 and Operation Cockade in 1943). As a result, John Bevan, {{head of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and charged with overall organisation of Bodyguard, was concerned that visual/wireless deception <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to create a believable threat.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} emerged from these studies was the problem of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches {{would have to be}} carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} there <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike in search of food and shelter for the winter.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough,</b> and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|In February 1933, {{the group}} issued a {{prospectus}} that contained publication data and guaranteed that the magazine {{would have no}} fewer than sixty-four pages per issue. Other writers, including Armijn's elder brother Sanusi Pane and poet Muhammad Yamin, were called {{to serve on the}} editorial board. Worried that there <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> subscribers to support the magazine and hoping to ensure a good reception from traditional groups, the founders sent letters to leaders of ten sultanates in the archipelago asking that they subscribe to the magazine; however, only Syarif Muhammad Alkadrie, the sultan of Pontianak, agreed to subscribe.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{came close}} to {{qualifying}} for the 1986 FIFA World Cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to Iceland and Spain. Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park, before recording a surprise 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal. A 3–0 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park, though a draw <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> The game ended in a 1–1 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes's opener; Southall got a hand to the penalty, but could not keep it out. However, {{the result of the}} game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack {{at the end of the}} game and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, {{the governments}} of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for {{international}} aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1million in medicine and other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that this <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1million. The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond {{more to the}} {{distress}} calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals {{are more likely to}} get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E
