She can take it to Donald Rumsfeld, but she cannot take it across the street to an article3 court.|$|E

In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians. President Clinton singled Bentsen out for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: 'In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He's here <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight.</b> Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.' Bentsen appeared {{in the summer of}} 2004 at the portrait unveilings at the White House of former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Senator Hillary Clinton.|$|E

It did not appear again until 24November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the Vertigo Tour. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer Willie Williams voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990.

Perhaps you don't know, or don't want to know, that it was I who got up this 'Library and Home Circle of the Sisters of Tasajara' which we are to open to-day. And can you imagine why? You remember--or have you forgotten--that you once affected to be concerned at the social condition of the young ladies on the plains of Sidon?

The New York Police Department had given Springsteen a personal boat escort for the first show (in addition to giving E Streeter Max Weinberg an escort because he was running late). But then Springsteen had made a rare (for this tour) performance of [...] "American Skin (41 Shots)", a song about the NYPD shooting of Amadou Diallo, in that show.

40|$|This {{symposium}} {{is concerned}} with the possible effects of peace between the two parts of Ireland on the economies of both and on the island of Ireland as a whole. It goes without saying that the greatest and overwhelming dividend of peace is the ending of loss of life and human misery, especially in NI. The question before <b>us</b> <b>tonight</b> is the secondary one of whether there is likely to be an economic bonus flowing from the peace and what form it might take. Any attempt to answer this question must be speculative at best - for a number of reasons. First, there are no analogues in recent history to guide us. The ending of the Cold War and the Re-unification of Germany, for example, could hardly be taken as even approximate models. Second, the results of any "positive shock" are difficult to predict and, in this instance the difficulties are compounded by attitudinal factors, weak economic links and by data deficiencies...|$|R
