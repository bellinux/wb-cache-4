50|$|There are {{two main}} ways to produce the {{magnetic}} field used in the alternators, by using permanent magnets which create their own persistent magnetic field or by using field coils. The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called magnetos. In other alternators, <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> coils form an electromagnet to produce the rotating magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|The stator {{consists}} of multiple projecting (salient) electromagnet poles, {{similar to a}} <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> brushed DC motor. The rotor {{consists of}} soft magnetic material, such as laminated silicon steel, which has multiple projections acting as salient magnetic poles through magnetic reluctance. For switched reluctance motors, the number of rotor poles is typically less {{than the number of}} stator poles, which minimizes torque ripple and prevents the poles from all aligning simultaneously—a position which cannot generate torque.|$|E
50|$|Originally all large {{industrial}} DC motors used <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> or rotor magnets. Permanent magnets have traditionally only been useful on small motors {{because it was}} difficult to find a material capable of retaining a high-strength field. Only recently have advances in materials technology allowed the creation of high-intensity permanent magnets, such as neodymium magnets, allowing the development of compact, high-power motors without the extra real-estate of field coils and excitation means. But as these high performance permanent magnets become more applied in electric motor or generator systems, other problems are realized (see Permanent magnet synchronous generator).|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{rotational}} {{speed of a}} DC motor {{is proportional to the}} EMF in its coil (= the voltage applied to it minus voltage lost on its resistance), and the torque is proportional to the current. Speed control can be achieved by variable battery tappings, variable supply voltage, resistors or electronic controls. The direction of a <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> DC motor can be changed by reversing either the field or armature connections but not both. This is commonly done with a special set of contactors (direction contactors). The effective voltage can be varied by inserting a series resistor or by an electronically controlled switching device made of thyristors, transistors, or, formerly, mercury arc rectifiers.|$|E
5000|$|The SRM has <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> coils as in a DC motor for the stator windings. The rotor however has no magnets or coils attached. It {{is a solid}} salient-pole rotor (having {{projecting}} magnetic poles) made of soft {{magnetic material}} (often laminated-steel). When power {{is applied to the}} stator windings, the rotor's magnetic reluctance creates a force that attempts to align the rotor pole with the nearest stator pole. In order to maintain rotation, an electronic control system switches on the windings of successive stator poles in sequence so that the magnetic field of the stator [...] "leads" [...] the rotor pole, pulling it forward. Rather than using a troublesome high-maintenance mechanical commutator to switch the winding current as in traditional motors, the switched-reluctance motor uses an electronic position sensor to determine the angle of the rotor shaft and solid state electronics to switch the stator windings, which also offers the opportunity for dynamic control of pulse timing and shaping. This differs from the apparently similar induction motor which also has windings that are energised in a rotating phased sequence, in that the magnetization of the rotor is static (a salient pole that is made 'North' remains so as the motor rotates) while an induction motor has slip, and rotates at slightly less than synchronous speed. This absence of slip makes it possible to know the rotor position exactly, and the motor can be stepped arbitrarily slowly.|$|E

Injury to the cornea causes a short circuit of the TEP at the wound.

These circulating endogenous currents generate an electric field orientated towards the wound, with the wound the cathode. Many cell types, including human corneal epithelial cells and keratinocytes, migrate to the cathode at physiological electric field strengths. Indeed, the electric signal is a powerful stimulator of cell migration, which appears to override other cues such as chemotaxis and wound void.

The procedure for derivation of flux linkage equations along any general rotating axes including stator flux axes is given. The stator flux equations are used to identify the cross-coupling occurring between the axes due to saliency in the machine. The coupling terms are canceled as feedforward terms in the generation of references for current controllers to achieve good decoupling during transients. The design of current controller for stator-flux-oriented control is presented.

40|$|Teaching basic {{principles}} of colonisation, contamination and infection has revolutionised approaches to wound care. Wound colonisation is classified as the existence of bacteria with no obvious host reaction (Carville 2005). The act of wound contamination is recognised as introducing micro-organisms into the wound (Ellis 2004). Wound infection is an invasion and multiplication of micro-organisms causing localised and systemic effects (Baranoski & Ayello 2004). Through clinical practice nurses inadvertently engage in wound contamination thus setting the environment for wound infection. Previously, education focused on teaching nursing students technicalities of maintaining a sterile dressing field (Ellis & Beckmann 1997, Ellis 2004). This method taught students to mimic practice rather than critically consider practice during wound care. Currently wound education considers how, when, where and what contaminated the <b>wound</b> <b>field.</b> The <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> encompasses both the wound surface and the dressing surface (Ellis & Beckmann 1998). Students are encouraged to regard these two surfaces as one common field not two separate areas. Most wounds carry a bacterial load (Thomas Hess & Kirsner 2003), classifying them as no...|$|E

40|$|Conventional thyristor-based load commutated {{inverter}} (LCI) -fed <b>wound</b> <b>field</b> {{synchronous machine}} operates only above a minimum speed {{that is necessary}} to develop enough back emf to ensure commutation. The drive is started and brought up to a speed of around 10 - 15 % by a complex `dc link current pulsing' technique. During this process, the drive have problems such as pulsating torque, insufficient average starting torque, longer starting time, etc. In this regard a simple starting and low-speed operation scheme, by employing an auxiliary low-power voltage source inverter (VSI) between the LCI and the machine terminals, is presented in this study. The drive is started and brought up to a low speed of around 15 % using the VSI alone with field oriented control. The complete control is then smoothly and dynamically transferred to the conventional LCI control. After the control transfer, the VSI is turned off and physically disconnected from the main circuit. The advantages of this scheme are smooth starting, complete control of torque and flux at starting and low speeds, less starting time, stable operation, etc. The voltage rating of the required VSI is very low of the order of 10 - 15 %, whereas the current rating is dependent on the starting torque requirement of the load.

2500|$|A PM motor {{does not}} have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the {{magnetic}} field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the [...] "dynamo" [...] type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors <b>wound</b> <b>fields</b> for large machines.|$|R
