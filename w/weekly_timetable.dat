Class-Teacher <b>Timetabling</b> Problem determines <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> for class-teacher {{pair with}} respect to certain hard and soft constraints, and institutions’ speciﬁc constraints. Group {{balancing}} problem aims to create heterogeneous structure within the groups, and homogeneous structure between the groups. In this thesis, mathematical models are developed for class-teacher timetabling problem and group balancing problem frequently encountered during the planning of new semester in educational institutions. Additionally, a web-based decision support system (DSS) is designed for the related problems. As a contribution to this sub-ﬁeld, this study provides tools to the planners to prepare <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> and class lists in a short time. A mixed-integer model is developed for group balancing problem, and aims to minimize deviationofaveragescoreofthegeneratedclassesfromthegeneralaverage, andtoensure balanced distribution of students among classes according to gender, international, and repeat status. A binary integer model proposed for class-teacher timetabling problem. This model is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem with no objective function, but includes general timetabling constraints and speciﬁc constraints for the institution. Many educational institutions still prepare timetables manually {{due to lack of}} general applicability of customized software. The end-user interface allows planners to use mathematical model instead of manually preparing <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> and class lists. The exclusive contribution {{of this study is to}} design a DSS for the end user. The functions of this DSS include data entry, pre-processing of data, solving the problem, and reporting solution. DSS is based on PHP script, and GAMS is used to solve mathematical models. The data from İstanbul Şehir University School of Languages English Preparatory Program (SEPP) is used as a case study to demonstrate operation of the system. Class lists and <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> were successfully created within minutes instead of two days taken manually. SEPP approved the timetables and declared that our system satisﬁes their requests. Class lists and <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> for Spring 2017 have been planned using our system.

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} method to {{generate}} optimal <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables</b> for tutors at the University of Washington Math Study Center using stated and inferred preferences. These timetables were previously generated using heuristics. We show {{that it is possible}} to create timetables using a model based on Integer Programming that are superior to the previous schedules. We compare two variants of our model. The ¯rst involves the progressive relaxation of the least important constraints and the second incorporates a penalty for constraint relaxation directly into the objective function. We ¯nd that the second approach generates better schedules. We ¯nd that using our model instead of the old system creates improvements in the value of the objective function of up to 7. 2 %. Less prosaically, our model creates schedules that signi¯cantly increase the satisfaction and happiness of the individual tutors. 1. Problem Statement The Math Study Center (MSC) at the University of Washington is a tutorial facility for undergraduate students taking mathematics classes. The tutors are graduate and undergraduate students at the University. Each quarter, the MSC needs to create timetables (work schedules) for between 8 and 20 tutors. The MSC is typically open 56 hours a week, and certain times, like Monday afternoons, have historically been busy and require more tutors. Thus, for each time slot (1 hour) the MSC determines a number between 1 and...|$|R

40|$|A queuing {{model is}} {{developed}} for the neurological rehabilitation unit at Rookwood Hospital in Cardiff. Arrivals at the queuing system are represented by patient referrals and service is represented by patient length of stay (typically five months). Since there are often delays to discharge, length of stay is partitioned into two parts: admission until date ready for discharge (modelled by Coxian phase-type distribution) and date ready for discharge until ultimate discharge (modelled by exponential distribution). The attributes of patients (such as age, gender, diagnosis etc) {{are taken into account}} since they affect these distributions. A computer program has been developed to solve this multi-server (21 bed) queuing system to produce steady-state probabilities and various performance measures. However, early on in the project it became apparent that the intensity of treatment received by patients has an effect on the time, from admission, until they are ready for discharge. That is, the service rates of the Coxian distribution are dependent on the amount of therapy received over time. This directly relates to the amount of treatment allocated in the <b>weekly</b> <b>timetables.</b> For the physiotherapy department, these take about eight hours to produce each week by hand. In order to ask the valuable what-if questions that relate to treatment intensity, it is therefore necessary to produce an automated scheduling program that replicates the manual assignment of therapy. The quality of timetables produced using this program was, in fact, considerably better than its alternative and so replaced the by-hand approach. Other benefits are more clinical time (since less employee input is required) and a convenient output of data and performance measures that are required for audit purposes. Once the model is constructed a number of relevant hypothetical scenarios are considered. Such as, what if delays to discharge are reduced by 50...|$|R
40|$|The ever growing {{gap between}} {{secondary}} and university level mathematics {{continues to be}} a major concern to higher education institutions. The increase in diversity of students’ background in mathematics, from students who have studied the more traditional A-level programmes to students with BTEC or international qualifications and part-time students who have been out of education for long periods, means that they are often unprepared for the marked shift in levels and catering for all abilities is difficult in the normal lecture, tutorial format. Lack of sufficient mathematical knowledge not only affects students’ success on courses but also leads to disengagement and thus a high drop-out rate in the first 2 years of study. Many universities now offer a maths support service in an attempt to overcome this but their success is varied. Previously, the author presented a novel on-line approach to maths support designed and adopted by the University of Lincoln, School of Engineering and funded as part of the National HE STEM Programme, to bridge this transition gap for students, offer continued support through assessment for learning (AFL) and ultimately increase student success, engagement and retention. On-line diagnostic tests, containing levelled exam style questions, are administered after each taught topic which highlights specific support areas for each student. Support is then offered via numerous on-line resources and more traditional <b>weekly</b> <b>timetabled</b> sessions tailored to individual student needs. The system also incorporates a ‘student expert’ system as a way of encouraging peer-to-peer support and harnessing the knowledge of gifted and talented students. The on-line system builds on a previous system developed by Lincoln which was proven to increase student success, retention and engagement. Since its implementation in September 2012, the new on-line system {{has proven to be a}} huge success not only in terms of monitoring the progress of students and offering targeted support but also as a way of addressing the issues surrounding poor engagement in maths support. Results show that with this system in place there is further improvement in student achievement for all students. They also show that for those students who still did not engage in the more traditional ‘out of hours’ support sessions, they still achieved high marks purely through the on-line system.

The constraints and preferences related to a single course timetable are embedded in the column generation procedure.

The interaction between the column generation procedure and the branch-and-bound method is also discussed. Some computational results are shown. ...|$|E
