5|$|Early {{in their}} career, Madness <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to skinheads; {{members of a}} British working-class {{subculture}} that the media often stereotyped as racist (although many skinheads, including the original generation, are non-racist or anti-racist). Not only was Madness, along with other 2 Tone bands, popular with skinheads, but {{it was said that}} the band members were associated with the subculture.|$|E
5|$|Gods <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{excavations}} {{have revealed}} a large temple complex {{on the site}} without parallel in western Europe, {{with more than a}} dozen large temples that <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements.|$|E
50|$|The field F <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> if any two {{quaternion}} algebras over F <b>are</b> <b>linked.</b> Every {{global and}} local field <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> since all quadratic forms of degree 6 over such fields are isotropic.|$|R

5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to {{autosomal}} dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene {{is located on}} the first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is expressed in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{was also}} {{closely linked to}} ravens because in Norse myths he {{received}} the fallen warriors at Valhalla, and ravens <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> with death and war due to their predilection for carrion. It is consequently likely that they were regarded as manifestations of the Valkyries, goddesses who chose the valiant dead for military service in Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|Their nearest analogies are {{the circles}} found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is also {{possible}} that the stone circles <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.|$|E
50|$|AP-5 is {{the most}} {{recently}} described complex, and one reason supporting {{the idea that it}} is an authentic adaptor complex is that it is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, as is AP-4. AP-1 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to MEDNIK syndrome. AP-3 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. COPI <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to an autoimmune disease. COPII <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia.One of the GGA proteins may be involved in Alzheimer's disease.|$|R

5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet recovered from a Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized from the men.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to the hurricane directly or indirectly, including one during evacuations. Total damage {{was estimated to}} be in excess of 5.4billion pesos (US$323.3million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5million in damage across Southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{police were}} unclear {{how the two}} groups from Sydney and Brisbane <b>were</b> <b>linked,</b> but did {{establish}} the movements {{of members of the}} group before their departure for Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed by Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company with more than 9000 employees. Norman, Lawrence, Martin, Stephens and Chan, a supervisor with the company, all worked for Eurest, which provided hospitality services to the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the group was employed. Rush and Czugaj alleged they were recruited by Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, their co-defendant and the alleged financier of the smuggling plan, while socialising at a karaoke bar in Brisbane.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, the Borromean rings {{consist of}} three topological circles which <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> {{and form a}} Brunnian link (i.e., {{removing}} any ring results in two unlinked rings). In other words, no {{two of the three}} rings <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> with each other as a Hopf link, but nonetheless all three <b>are</b> <b>linked.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.|$|E
5|$|In addition, White Eagles paramilitaries {{arrived in}} Borovo Selo in mid-April {{at the request}} of Borovo Selo militia {{commander}} Vukašin Šoškoćanin. The paramilitaries were armed by the Serbian police directly, or the SAO Krajina-aligned local militia under the approval of Serbian officials. By the end of April 1991, the White Eagles in Borovo Selo were joined by Dušan Silni paramilitaries, who <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to the Serbian National Renewal party.|$|E

5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was {{dominated}} by adjoining utility buildings, which <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to it by high-level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only {{one of which was}} subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre around the building that houses the information about the atomic explosion.|$|E
5|$|London Underground's Charing Cross tube {{station on}} the Northern and Bakerloo lines has an exit in the square. The lines had {{separate}} stations, of which the Bakerloo line one was called Trafalgar Square until they <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> and renamed in 1979 {{as part of the}} construction of the Jubilee line, which was rerouted to Westminster tube station in 1999. Other nearby tube stations are Embankment connecting the District, Circle, Northern and Bakerloo lines, and Leicester Square on the Northern and Piccadilly lines.|$|E
50|$|How {{and when}} Traits <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> <b>is</b> {{definitely}} open to interpretation.

5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both interest costs and amounts to be committed to the sinking fund.|$|E
5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when they occurred. Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could be ordered to switch the navigation lights off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|E
