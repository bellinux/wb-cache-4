25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is similar to}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> the green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior {{have been found in}} hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E

Related to this path, Darren Aronofsky described {{the core of the}} film as [...] "a very simple love story" [...] about {{a man and a woman}} in love, with the woman's life cut short. The director researched people who were dying young, and learned from doctors and caregivers that such patients find new ways of coping.

500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd whip up an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing. [...] And <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> that is you're just as often likely to have people who want to kill you as applaud you." [...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E

However, he was cautious about his team's prospects going into the year, saying: [...] "We've just got {{to wait and see}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> this car, that's the question mark". At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, he was forced to retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers' Championship, with eight points.|$|E

2500|$|Within the Theravada-tradition, three {{different}} stances on nirvana {{and the question}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> the Arhat after death can be found. Nirvana refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (khlesa-nirvana); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas {{at the time of}} death (skandha-nirvana or parinirvana); and to a transcendental reality which is [...] "known at the moment of awakening." [...] According to Gethin, [...] "modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience. According to Geisler and Amano, in the [...] "minimal Theravada interpretation", nirvana is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence.

2500|$|As {{additional}} tests are discussed for {{addition to the}} panels, issues arise. [...] Many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the {{additional tests}}. [...] Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, {{while some of the}} diseases need not be treated until later in life. [...] This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? And if we do, what do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. This is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> their infant's blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not exactly," [...] {{our friend}} assented to our intention. [...] "The {{successive}} groups have constantly sought more central, more desirable, more fashionable situations. They have built not {{better than they}} knew, for that could not be, but costlier, and they have finished in hard woods, with marble halls and marbleized hall-boys, and the first expense has been much greater; but actual disaster has not yet followed; perhaps it is too soon; we must not be impatient; but what has already happened is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>with</b> other beautiful things that the æsthetic invent. It has happened notoriously with all the most lovable and livable summer places which the artists and authors find out and settle themselves cheaply and tastefully in. The Philistines, a people wholly without invention, a cuckoo tribe incapable of self-nesting, stumble upon those joyous homes by chance, or by mistaken invitation. They submit meekly enough at first to be sub-neighbors ruled in all things by {{the genius of the}} place; but once in, they begin to lay their golden eggs in some humble cottage, and then they hatch out broods of palatial villas equipped with men and maid servants, horses, carriages, motors, yachts; and if the original settlers remain it is in a helpless inferiority, a broken spirit, and an overridden ideal. This tragical history is the same at Magnolia, and at York Harbor, and at Dublin, and at Bar Harbor; even at Newport itself; the co-operative housing of New York is making a like history. It is true that the Philistines do not come in and dispossess the autochthonic groups; these will not sell to them; but they have imagined doing on a sophisticated and expensive scale what the æsthetics have done simply and cheaply. They are buying the pleasanter sites, and are building co-operatively; though they have already eliminated the studio and the central principle, and they build for the sole occupancy of the owners. But the cost of their housing then is such that it puts them out of the range of our inquiry as their riches has already put them beyond the range of our sympathy. It still remains for any impecunious group to buy the cheaper lots, and build simpler houses on the old studio principle, with rents enough to pay the cost of operation, and leave the owners merely the interest and taxes, with the eventual payment of these also by the tenants. Some of the studio apartments are equipped with restaurants, and the dwellers need only do such light housekeeping as ladies may attempt without disgrace, or too much fatigue." ...|$|E
