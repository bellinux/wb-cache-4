He also shortened the prayer book (adopting Wise's Minhag America version), added a late Friday night service, and created patriotically themed services for Thanksgiving and National Fast Day. When more pews {{were required to}} accommodate the worshipers, they were first added to the men's and women's sections, then family pews were added <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> could sit together.

25|$|Jack and Jill {{competitions}} imitate social dancing. Dancers enter as individuals, {{as either}} a 'jack' (leader) or 'jill' (follower). Most competitions do not dictate jills be female or jacks male. There are, however, 'jack and jack' and 'jill and jill' competitions <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are paired separately. Entrants are paired with partners randomly and then dance to music (whose duration varies). They are then allocated another random partner. Jack and Jill competitions vary in strict format, with some ending at this point, and judges awarding points for performances to that stage. Many Jack and Jills often continue, with dancers paired with a third partner (or remaining with their second) for the remaining rounds of the competition.|$|E
500|$|According to {{director}} Toru Haga, {{creating an}} original world and scenario after their time working on licensed properties was challenging. The {{concept of the}} Laws, the deities of Impedia, {{was based on the}} Eastern philosophical concept of [...] "yin yang wu xing": each [...] "Law" [...] was an aspect or element of the world, which balanced against each other and had two opposing counterparts representing each element. If one part vanished, the balance would be disrupted and the natural would be adversely effected, as portrayed in the game. These concepts influenced the design of the Towers: the first three were designed around wood, earth and water, then later towers representing metal and fire. Each tower was divided into [...] "male" [...] (yang) and [...] "female" [...] (yin) halves. This concept was applied so as to keep the Towers from being repetitive for players, using different shades and designs while retaining their shared symbolic color. The law against eating meat present in the world was inspired by a social phenomenon noted by Yamakura <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> approached each other counter to popular views on gender relationships, translated as [...] "carnivorous girls and herbivorous boys": this concept gave birth to the scenes of Elena having trouble eating the flesh offerings.|$|E

500|$|The climactic sword {{fight between}} Veerasimhan and Sasankan has been {{compared}} to the fight in the 1894 novel, The Prisoner of Zenda. In 1976, American film historian William K. Everson compared the comedians in Chandralekha to Laurel and Hardy. Although Randor Guy considers the film's drum-dance scene {{the first of its kind}} in Indian cinema, the 1947 film Naam Iruvar includes a scene when the lead actress' younger sister dances on drums to the Tamil poet Subramania Bharati's [...] "Kottu Murase"; French film historian Yves Thoraval wrote that it [...] "prefigured the dance that Chandralekha made famous the very next year." [...] According to American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, the film [...] "belongs to the same childhood continuum" [...] as Fritz Lang's 1959 films The Tiger of Eschnapur and The Indian Tomb (which were set in India). In his 2009 book, 50 Indian Film Classics, film critic M. K. Raghavendra wrote that Chandralekha was constructed in a manner which [...] "enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre." [...] According to Guy, the setting of the song [...] "Naattiya Kuthirai" [...] with Sundari Bai (including her dance and costume) were inspired by the 1943 musical film Coney Island. Film scholar Uma Vangal wrote that the film reflects Vasan's [...] "vision of a truly democratic nation, based on equal rights for men and women" [...] by portraying [...] "a world <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> work together to establish a rightful rule".|$|E

Adam I, created {{in the image of}} God, fulfills this apparently [...] "secular" [...] mandate by conquering the universe, imposing his knowledge, technology, and cultural institutions upon the world.

30|$|However, Muslim {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the property right {{of the woman in}} Islam is fair (Labib 1995, p. 7; Al-Tabari 2000, vol. 8, p. 2 70). The property distribution is made based on the role <b>and</b> responsibility of <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> in the Muslim society (Al-Qurtubi 1964, vol. 5, p. 168). In the Islamic social system, a man has more responsibility than a woman (Dangor 2001). A man is responsible for providing nafaqah (money that the husband has to provide to the wife for her sustenance) to his wife and children (Al-Tabari 2000, vol. 8, p. 270). Moreover, Muslim scholars point out that Islamic inheritance distribution is comprehensive (Barlow and Akbarzadeh 2006).

2500|$|The {{eighteenth century}} was {{characterized}} by three divergent views towards woman: that women were mentally and socially inferior to men, that they were equal but different, and that women were potentially equal in both mental ability and contribution to society. While individuals such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed women's roles were confined to motherhood and service to their male partners, the Enlightenment was {{a period in which}} women experienced expanded roles in the sciences. [...] The rise of salon culture in Europe brought philosophers and their conversation to an intimate setting <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> met to discuss contemporary political, social, and scientific topics. While Jean-Jacques Rousseau attacked women-dominated salons as producing ‘effeminate men’ that stifled serious discourse, salons were characterized in this era by the mixing of the sexes. Through salons and their work in mathematics, physics, botany, and philosophy, women began to have a significant impact during the Enlightenment. Women were not entirely excluded from being officially acknowledged by the scientific world.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome K. Jerome {{has been}} cited as an {{influence}} on Zamyatin’s novel. Jerome’s short essay [...] "The New Utopia" [...] (1891) describes a regimented future city, indeed world, of nightmarish egalitarianism, <b>where</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are barely distinguishable in their grey uniforms (Zamyatin's [...] "unifs") and all have short black hair, natural or dyed. No one has names: women wear even numbers on their tunics, and men wear odd, just as in We. Equality is taken to such lengths that people with well-developed physiques are liable to have lopped limbs. In Zamyatin, similarly, the equalisation of noses is earnestly proposed. Jerome has anyone with an overactive imagination subjected to a levelling-down operation—something of central importance in We. Even more significant is the appreciation {{on the part of}} both Jerome and Zamyatin that the individual, and by extension, familial love, is a disruptive and humanizing force. [...] Jerome's works were translated in Russia three times before 1917. Three Men in a Boat is a set book in Russian schools.|$|E
