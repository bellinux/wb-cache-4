If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1875, Sioux {{delegations}} {{headed by}} Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem {{the flow of}} miners into their territories. [...] They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. [...] The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). [...] The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. [...] Spotted Tail said, [...] "You speak of another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it. [...] I was not born there... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone." [...] Although the chiefs were unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, they did not join Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull in the warfare that followed.|$|E

2500|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] " [...] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> native people but yet they're trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E

60|$|March 15th.--I {{pray that}} in one year more I may find some way of {{escaping}} from this unblest Custom-House; for {{it is a very}} grievous thraldom. I do detest all offices,--all, at least, that are held on a political tenure. And I <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> politicians.

It is a knowledge which no previous thought or power of sympathy could have taught me, because the animal, or the machine rather, is not in nature.|$|E
