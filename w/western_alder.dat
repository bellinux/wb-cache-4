500|$|Above the floodplain, much of {{the habitat}} in the {{watershed}} consists of mixed conifer forest. Trees and shrubs, including stands of red alder and cottonwood trees, cover about 88percent of the middle reaches. Near the headwaters, the forests [...] consist mainly of mixed conifers and hardwoods with a few older Douglas firs. Common species include big leaf maple, willow, <b>western</b> hemlock, red <b>alder,</b> <b>western</b> red cedar, and Douglas-fir. Most of this forest is relatively young. In Forest Park, old-growth forest, undisturbed for 250years or more, exists mainly in isolated patches. The largest tree in the park, Heritage Tree 134, is a Douglas-fir near the Stone House. It is [...] high, and the trunk is [...] in circumference.|$|R

50|$|The {{entirety}} of the Eagle Creek watershed {{is in the}} coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia. The protected lands of Burnaby Mountain, {{as well as the}} lands of Burnaby Lake Regional Park are forested with a second growth forest that primarily consists of bigleaf maple, red <b>alder,</b> <b>western</b> hemlock, western redcedar, and Douglas-fir, with an underbrush of salmonberry, Indian plum, red elderberry, and other shrubs and herbs. Mammals found here include the Douglas squirrel, black-tailed deer, coyote, and raccoon. Many birds and amphibians also inhabit the watershed.|$|R
50|$|Moving up in {{elevation}} {{and moisture}} availability is the silver fir zone, {{up to about}} 3900 ft. This zone gets more precipitation, and more of it as snow, than the lower, warmer, drier western hemlock zone. The cold and the snowpack combine to limit growth of lower-elevation plants. On the other hand, silver fir is less drought tolerant and less fire tolerant than either Douglas-fir or <b>western</b> hemlock. Slide <b>alder</b> (Alnus viridis sinuata) grows in snow-creep areas and avalanche chutes, along with yellow-cedar. Meadows of thimbleberry also grow in this zone, often intergrading between the slide alder chutes and the silver fir forest.|$|R
50|$|The humid coastal {{climate of}} Big Sur and the McWay Canyon area {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of vegetation in McWay Canyon. By the coast, the most prominent riparian vegetation consists of willows, <b>alders,</b> <b>western</b> coltsfoot and elk clover, with other species also existing among the dominant plants. Redwood trees also exist in McWay Canyon, but due to salty ocean air, it is said that the ones closer to the shore have not survived healthily. Coastal sage scrub is the dominant ground cover, specked by monkey flowers, Indian paintbrush, common yarrow, blue blossom and coast morning glory.|$|R

50|$|Armillaria {{can remain}} viable in stumps for 50 years. Chemical {{treatments}} do not eradicate the fungus entirely, {{and they are}} not cost-effective. The most frequent and effective approach to managing root disease problems is to attempt to control them at final harvest by replanting site-suited tree species that are disease tolerant. In eastern Washington that typically means replacing Douglas-fir or true fir stands with ponderosa pine, western larch, western white pine, lodgepole pine, <b>western</b> red cedar, <b>alder,</b> or spruce. Species susceptibility varies somewhat from location to location. All trees in the disease center as well as uninfected trees within 50 feet should be cut. No tree from a highly susceptible species should be planted within 100 feet of a disease center.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{growth of}} western hemlock {{during the first}} four years of {{seedling}} establishment was examined in a competitive environment in which seedlings were exposed to various types of animal damage and salmonberry and/or alder competition. The study utilized an existing Nelder/replacement series experiment which focused on the competitive effects among <b>western</b> hemlock, red <b>alder,</b> and salmonberry. Vegetative competition was evaluated in terms of overtopping and encroaching cover within a one meter radius of each seedling. Animal damage observed in the study included browsing, (feeding injury of deer and elk), racking (antler rubbing from deer and elk), clipping and girdling (feeding injury from rabbits and hares.) Hemlock growth in terms of total height, height growth, and total volume, was compared between damaged and undamaged seedlings through multiple regression analysis. Sites used in this study were located in the central Coast Range of Oregon on three separate clearcut units. Growth reductions for hemlock seedlings were mainly due to vegetative competition. The best predictors of hemlock growth were overtopping by salmonberry and overtopping by alder. Hemlock seedlings experienced greater growth reductions due to vegetative competition than from the presence of animal damage. This held true for all animal damage, except clipping by lagomorphs. The clipped seedlings showed significant reductions in growth due to the clipping damage. Results suggest the importance of managing competing vegetation to reduce conifer losses and minimize dense shrub habitat which foster rabbit and hare populations...|$|R
