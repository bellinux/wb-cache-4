Anthony , a writer for The Buffalo News, remarked that Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs songs [...] "Superfly Sister", [...] "Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Is It Scary" [...] were [...] "programmed plastic soul that makes you wonder how someone as talented as Jackson can churn out such tracks".|$|E

Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter".
