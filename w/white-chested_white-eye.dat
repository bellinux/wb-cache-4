Other endemic birds are the <b>white-chested</b> <b>white-eye,</b> which may be extinct, the Norfolk parakeet, the Norfolk gerygone, the slender-billed white-eye and endemic subspecies of the Pacific robin and golden whistler.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-chested</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops albogularis) {{also known}} as white-breasted white-eye or Norfolk white-eye is a {{passerine}} from the family Zosteropidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island between New Caledonia and New Zealand and it is regarded as either extremely rare or possibly extinct. Since 2000 the Australian government has considered the species extinct.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{threats are}} habitat {{destruction}} and invasive species. The {{decline of the}} <b>white-chested</b> <b>white-eye</b> began as the introduced silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) became naturalized on Norfolk Island. It displaced the <b>white-chested</b> <b>white-eye</b> from its breeding range. From the 1940s rats destroyed the nests and clearing of the forests led to a severe decline in the population to only 50 individuals in 1962. In 1986 the Norfolk Island National Park was established to save this bird from extinction, {{but because of the}} fluctuation of this species, surveys often remained unsuccessful. In 1978 only four individuals were monitored, and a sighting in 2000 resulted in one individual; bird watchers claimed to have seen the bird in 2005, however official surveys have not recorded the species since 1980. A predator-exclusion fence was built around the last remaining habitat in the Norfolk Island National Park. A survey by ornithologist Guy Dutson in 2009 failed to find any individuals.|$|E
25|$|Norfolk Island, with {{neighbouring}} Nepean Island, {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of <b>white-chested</b> and slender-billed <b>white-eyes,</b> Norfolk parakeets and Norfolk gerygones, as well as over 1% of the world populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds. Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA.|$|R

50|$|Norfolk Island National Park is a {{protected}} area of 6.50 km2 established in 1984 and {{managed by the}} Commonwealth of Australia. It comprises two sections, the Mount Pitt section on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific Ocean with an area of 4.60 km2 and the neighbouring 1.90 km2 Phillip Island, {{as well as the}} much smaller Nepean Island. The Norfolk Island group is an Australian territory and the park is managed by Parks Australia. It is {{the only place in the}} world where the Norfolk Island parakeet and the <b>white-chested</b> <b>white-eye</b> occur.|$|E
