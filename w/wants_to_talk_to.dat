5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
25|$|Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of {{the case}} of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, {{apparently}} killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of £30, which she kept under a floorboard. Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not think he is guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. No one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E
25|$|At Granny's, Regina is in {{mourning}} during a wake for Robin. Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina figure out that Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

500|$|Apart from S Voice, Samsung has {{directed}} {{the bulk of}} the SIII's marketing campaign towards the device's [...] "smart" [...] features, which facilitate improved human-device interactivity. These features include: [...] "Direct Call", or the handset's ability to recognise when a user <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> somebody instead of messaging them, if they bring the phone to their head; [...] "Social Tag", a function that identifies and tags people in a photo and shares photos with them; and [...] "Pop Up Play", which allows a video and other applications to occupy the screen at the same time. In addition, the SIII can beam its screen to a monitor or be used as a remote controller (AllShare Cast and Play) and share photos with people who are tagged in them (Buddy Photo Share).|$|E
500|$|Katie and Maggie enter. Maggie {{talks about}} Pat's [...] "frozen willies"—novelty ice cubes—as a distressed Jim makes her a drink, and Carol dances with the uninterested Katie. Jim pulls Carol away from Katie, but Carol hits him; when Carol talks to Katie about {{becoming}} her stepmother, Jim shouts at her. Pat stops him, and, after Carol storms out, tells Jim that [...] "he knows". Katie is distressed, and interrogates Jim as Maggie plunges a knife into the cake. Jim panics, believing Angela {{is still under}} the table, but Angela enters from the kitchen, and reveals that she left to buy a real cake—the story that Jim had told to cover her apparent absence. Katie <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her mother, but chaos ensues when Maggie chokes on an ice cube, which Pat reveals contains a fake spider. Carol enters, her face blackened by Pat's fake soap, and Pat, reaching for his charging phone to call the emergency services, is electrocuted, his hands wet from the ice bucket. Angela performs the Heimlich manoeuver on her mother; Carol kneels by Pat and shouts for help. The new cake is pushed into Jim's face by Katie, who then answers the door. The paramedic enters, then begins a striptease for Maggie to the Casualty theme. His performance, it is revealed, was Pat's present to Maggie. Later, Jim talks to an oblivious Maggie. He sees Angela and Katie come down the stairs with bags. In silence, he watches them leave as Maggie tells him the joke from Pat's birthday card.|$|E
2500|$|After Gacy {{left the}} store, Piest {{told his mother}} that [...] "some {{contractor}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me about a job". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly. When Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report on their son with the Des Plaines police. The owner of the pharmacy named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{would find}} myself {{thinking}} {{with the utmost}} particularity of her face. Had it changed at all? Was it altogether changed? I seemed to have forgotten everything and remembered everything; that peculiar slight thickness of her eyelids that gave her eyes their tenderness, that light firmness of her lips. Of course she would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, as now I perceived I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.

2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E

I find they are perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people, but they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are not realistic." ...|$|R
