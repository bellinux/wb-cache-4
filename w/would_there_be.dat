5|$|The graves {{made by the}} Iazyges {{were often}} {{rectangular}} or circular in shape. They were flat, and were grouped like a modern cemetery. During the time after the Iazyges migrated to the Tisza plain, and were in serious poverty. This {{is reflected in the}} poor furnishings of the burial sites, often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes brooches. Very rarely <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> iron daggers in the burial site, and even more rarely <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> iron swords. Their brooches and arm-rings were of the La Tène type, showing a distinct influence on the Iazyges by the Dacians.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{result that}} free complete lattices {{do not exist}} entails that an according free construction from a poset is not possible either. This is easily seen by considering posets with a discrete order, where every element only relates to itself. These are exactly the free posets on an underlying set. <b>Would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> a free construction of complete lattices from posets, then both constructions could be composed, which contradicts the negative result above.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{acquisition}} of the licence, CTL needed to find suitable sites for both a studio and a transmitter. Initially, Mount Ainslie (approximately 10km north-east of Canberra's city centre, at an elevation of 842 m above sea level) was considered as a potential transmitter site. It was turned down, however, because it was already {{under the control of}} the Department of Civil Aviation (who would be unwilling to surrender or lease the site due to its proximity to the Airport and the Air Force base). It was also determined that a transmitter located atop Mount Ainslie would not provide ample coverage of the entire Canberra area (notable black-spots would have included the Woden and Belconnen districts), nor <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> enough room for the ABC's television transmitter (whose service was due to commence in December 1962) as well as CTC. Other sites considered included Mounts Gray, Bowning, Ginini and Bull's Head.|$|E

40|$|This paper entertains {{the notion}} that without their {{opposite}}s, things, and by extension, human thought would not exist. Without its opposite aspect, each thing or thought loses the condition for its existence. Without life, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no death; without death, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no life. Without "above", <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no "below " without "below", <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no "above".

500|$|In {{front of}} this Main Defence Line was the IJssel-Maaslinie, a {{covering}} line along the rivers IJssel and Maas, connected by positions in the Betuwe, again with pillboxes and lightly occupied by a screen of fourteen [...] "border battalions". Late in 1939 General Van Voorst tot Voorst, reviving plans he had already worked out in 1937, proposed {{to make use of}} the excellent defensive opportunities these rivers offered. He proposed a shift to a more mobile strategy by fighting a delaying battle at the plausible crossing sites near Arnhem and Gennep to force the German divisions to spend much of their offensive power before they had reached the MDL, and ideally even defeat them. This was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders. The latter wanted the army to first offer heavy resistance at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position, and then fall back to the Fortress Holland. This also was considered too dangerous by the government, especially in light of German air supremacy, and had the disadvantage of having to fully prepare two lines. Reijnders had already been denied full military authority in the defence zones; the conflict about strategy further undermined his political position. On 5 February 1940 he was forced to offer his resignation because of these disagreements with his superiors. He was replaced by General Henry G. Winkelman who decided that in the north the Grebbe Line would be the main defence line where the decisive battle was to be waged, partly because it <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> easier to break out with a counteroffensive if the conditions were favourable. However, he took no comparable decision regarding the Peel-Raam Position.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Israel–Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War, James L.

[...] However, this does not make Palestinian identity any less legitimate: [...] "The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed {{in response to it}} does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some [...] "other." [...] Why else <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> the need to specify who you are?

2500|$|Initially, the Air Force {{brought their}} {{aircraft}} to Wright Field, {{and when the}} field could no longer handle additional aircraft, many were sent to Freeman Field to the foreign technology evaluation center established there.

2500|$|CANDU designs have a {{positive}} void coefficient {{as well as a}} small power coefficient, normally considered bad in reactor design. This implies that steam generated in the coolant will increase the reaction rate, which in turn would generate more steam. This {{is one of the many}} reasons for the cooler mass of moderator in the [...] calandria, as even a serious steam incident in the core would not have a major impact on the overall moderation cycle. Only if the moderator itself starts to boil <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> any significant effect, and the large thermal mass ensures this will occur slowly. The deliberately [...] "sluggish" [...] response of the fission process in CANDU allows controllers more time to diagnose and deal with problems.|$|E
2500|$|In his analysis, svabhāva is {{somewhat}} redefined from the Theravada interpretation to mean: inherent existence or self-characterization. Nagarjuna is notably departing from {{the interpretation of}} that term as merely meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If an object was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> for causes and conditions to bring that object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty.|$|E

2500|$|Eikev in [...] {{is given}} a {{conditional}} meaning in some English translations ('if') and a consequential meaning in other translations ('because'). The King James Version says 'if ye hearken to these judgments ...', the Orthodox Jewish Bible, a Messianic text {{not to be confused}} with those of Orthodox Judaism, says 'if you give heed ...' and the New International Version has 'if you pay attention ...' whereas the American Standard Version states 'because ye hearken ...' and the New King James Version has 'because you listen ...'. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that 'because' is a better translation [...] and the Pulpit Commentary notes that 'the Hebrew conveys the idea of a reward as consequent on their hearkening; as there would be retribution for transgression, so <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> recompense for obedience'. The Jerusalem Bible reflects this 'recompense' interpretation in its translation: [...] "Listen to these ordinances, be true to them and observe them, and in return Yahweh your God will be true to the covenant and love which he promised on oath to your ancestors".|$|E
2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." [...] Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description {{of the state of the}} screen, nowhere in that list <b>would</b> <b>there</b> <b>be</b> a mention of [...] "English sentences" [...] or [...] "a 7-Up can".|$|E
