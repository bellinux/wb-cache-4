5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back,</b> and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

The Philharmonic offered {{a total of six}} performances between June 29 and July 17 in Kaohsiung, Tainan and Taipei, Taiwan as well as in Seoul and Ulsan, South Korea. Though Chen initially thought she would remain with the Philharmonic for ten years, she left in 2007 to become assistant conductor of the Atlanta Symphony. She said of her departure: [...] "The musicians at PYP have become my kids. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back,</b> these five years will always be the most memorable time of my musical career." [...] Guest conductors during the 2007–2008 season included Ken Selden, director of orchestral studies at Portland State University, former Seattle Symphony conductor Alastair Willis, along with former PYP conductors Huw Edwards and Chen herself.|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{assurance}} was amazing, but it {{was past}} supper-time, and hunger getting the better of my curiosity, I bade him good-night. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> he was still there, {{on the edge of}} his boat, gazing at the sea. A queer sort of bird altogether, but attractive somehow.|$|R

500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

60|$|We lunched {{with the}} other three at Romsey. Then I sat in front {{for a little while}} to talk to my Malachi. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> Shend was solidly asleep, and stayed so for the next two hours, while Leggatt chased Attley's fat Daimler along the green-speckled hedges.

60|$|If I {{had spoken}} to Doctor Dormann as I had {{positively}} resolved to speak, he would, beyond all doubt, have forbidden the employment of Madame Fontaine's remedy; Mr. Keller would have died; and the innocent woman who had saved his {{life would have been}} suspected, perhaps even tried, on a charge of murdering him. <b>I</b> really trembled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on the terrible consequences which must have followed, if I had succeeded that morning in keeping myself awake.|$|R

And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful dream... the nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was warm. It was {{the warmest}} place I ever was in.

I folded my ears back so's they wouldn't hold the wind, and straightened myself out till I wasn't much thicker than a streak of daylight, jumping through the bushes whenever I saw a chance, so's Mr. Towser would be forced to go a good ways round, and before many minutes went by I had all my wits about me.|$|R
60|$|I {{spoke the}} last good-by and turned Satan {{into the narrow}} trail. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> Jones stood on the rim with the fresh glow of dawn shining on his face. The trail was steep, and claimed my {{attention}} and care, but {{time and time again}} I gazed back. Jones waved his hand till a huge jutting cliff walled him from view. Then I cast my eyes on the rough descent and the wonderful void beneath me. In my mind lingered a pleasing consciousness of my last sight of the old plainsman. He fitted the scene; he belonged there among the silent pines and the yellow crags.|$|R
2500|$|Campbell {{declined}} {{a number}} of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in 1862. For {{the duration of the}} job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. [...] By late 1864, he was pushing again {{for an end to the}} war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: [...] "You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon the events of the winter, I find that I was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result." ...|$|E

2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E

60|$|I had had so {{many reasons}} to believe in my friend's subtle powers of {{reasoning}} and extraordinary energy in action that I felt {{that he must have}} some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, {{in the case of the}} King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but wonder whether John's love {{for me was}} what it had been. Was it cooling? I asked myself. And what was cooling it? It hardly seemed possible, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> to the wild passion with which he had {{proposed}} {{to me on the}} garden bench, that John's love was waning. But I kept noticing different little things. One day in the spring-time I saw John getting out a lot of fishing tackle from a box and fitting it together. I asked him {{what he was going to}} do, and he said that he was going to fish. I went to my room and had a good cry. It seemed dreadful that he could neglect his wife for a few worthless fish.|$|R
2500|$|However, Powell {{lost his}} seat in the {{election}} by 731 votes to the Social Democratic and Labour Party's Eddie McGrady, mainly because of demographic and boundary changes that resulted in there being many more Irish Nationalists in the constituency than before. The boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign {{for the number of}} MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion {{for the rest of the}} United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. McGrady paid tribute to Powell, recognising the respect he was held by both Unionists and Nationalists in the constituency. Powell said, [...] "For the rest of my life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on the 13 years I shall be filled with affection for the Province and its people, and their fortunes will never be out of my heart". He received a warm ovation from the mostly Nationalist audience and as he walked off the platform, he said the words Edmund Burke used on the death of candidate Richard Coombe: [...] "What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue". When a BBC reporter asked Powell to explain his defeat, he replied: [...] "My opponent polled more votes than me".|$|E

60|$|Here {{he waited}} until they had gone by on their return journey. So close did they pass {{to him that he}} could overhear their talk, which told him they expected, or rather were sure, that we should be {{destroyed}} by the elephant Jana, their devil god, to whom the camelmen had been already sacrificed. After they had departed he remounted and followed us. Here I asked him why he had not overtaken us before we came to the cemetery of elephants, as I presumed he might have done, since he stated that he was close in our rear. This indeed was the case, for it {{was the head of the}} camel I saw behind the thorn trees <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> and not the trunk of an elephant as I had supposed.|$|R
5000|$|On that day, with {{a larger}} than normal ocean swell, Darrick Doerner piloted the watercraft, towing Hamilton. Pulling in and {{releasing}} the tow rope, Hamilton drove down into {{the well of the}} wave's enormous tunnel vortex, in full view of boat-based photographers' and videographers' cameras. With his signature artistic flair, Hamilton continued deeply carving water, emerging back over the wave's shoulder. A still photograph of him riding the wave made the cover of Surfer magazine, with the caption: [...] "oh my god..." [...] The wave became known as [...] "the heaviest ever ridden".In the filmed coverage of this event in the motion picture Riding Giants, Doerner said [...] "I towed him onto this wave. And it was to the point where I almost said 'Don't let go of the rope,' and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> he was gone." ...|$|R

Now had I an evidence, 'as I thought, of my salvation' from heaven, {{with many}} golden seals thereon, all hanging in my sight; now could I {{remember}} this manifestation {{and the other}} discovery of grace, with comfort; and should often long and desire that the last day were come, that I might for ever be inflamed with the sight, and joy, and communion with him whose head was crowned with thorns, whose face was spit on, and body broken, and soul made an offering for my sins: for whereas, before, I lay continually trembling {{at the mouth of}} hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom that <b>I</b> could not, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> scarce discern it; and, oh! thought I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die quickly, that my soul might be gone to rest.[32] ...|$|R

But I was off the road and had galloped a mile over the plain before this occurred to me. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>I</b> saw that the Prussians had spread out into a long line, so as to head me off from the Charleroi road. I could not turn back, but at least I could edge toward the north.

I will relate my insights and opinions of the following: some quantitative and qualitative measures of the value of WEB programming; a description of some tools that are part of an environment for writing and maintaining literate programs; literate programming environments that are alternatives to the WEB style; an annotated list of some literate programming systems; and I will conclude with my perception of the future of literate programming...|$|R
