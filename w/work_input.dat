The obtained results were presented with a table and description method. The analysis which was carried out proved that along with the intensity of production organization the number of physical workers increases in farms with simultaneous decrease of AL area. The investigated farms featured quite variable size of participation of capital calculated into the replacement value of mechanization means per a hectare of agri-cultural land.
