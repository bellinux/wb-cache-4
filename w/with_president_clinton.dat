500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along <b>with</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was here}} once before when we bailed out Mexico with the NAFTA treaty. The peso was falling apart. I {{was down in}} Mexico doing shows, drug dealers and cartels everywhere, {{and we were going}} to lend them billions of dollars.

If we are going to bail Mexico out, let us make them sign an {{extradition}} treaty of fugitives, murders, criminals and get our kids back from Mexico. Right? Did not happen. What a perfect time for us to say we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting <b>with</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and we do not know how many kids".|$|E
