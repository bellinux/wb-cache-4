25|$|In 1994, Speedway owner Tony George {{announced}} {{plans for a new}} series, to be called the Indy Racing League. The Indy 500 would serve as its centerpiece. Opinions varied on his motivations, with his supporters sharing his disapproval of the race's lack of status within CART, the increasing number of foreign drivers (as American drivers were gravitating towards NASCAR), and the decreasing number of ovals in the season series. Detractors accused George of throwing his <b>weight</b> <b>around</b> and using the race as leverage to gain complete control of the sport of open wheel racing in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The viral {{thymidine}} kinases differ completely {{from the}} mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors {{that do not}} inhibit the mammalian enzymes. The genes of the two human isoenzymes were localized in the mid-1970s. The gene for TK1 was cloned and sequenced. The corresponding protein has a molecular weight of about 25 kD. Normally, it occurs in tissue as a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD. It can be activated by ATP. After activation, is a tetramer with a molecular <b>weight</b> <b>around</b> 100 kD. However, the form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins. This complex is more stable and has a higher specific activity {{than any of the}} lower molecular weight forms.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1847, Rodman was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant, and {{was promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on July 1, 1855. Rodman experimented for almost a decade at the Fort Pitt Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, testing his theory and performing trial runs of his cannon barrels. After viewing the results, the U.S. War Department approved construction of a fifteen-inch smoothbore columbiad of Rodman's design in 1859. On December 23 a prototype was cast, and it test fired 509 times without incident. The following year he supervised its construction at the foundry, and once complete it was shipped for testing to Fortress Monroe at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. It tested successfully there in March 1861, but due to its size and weight it would be destined for permanent, fixed positions, and not suitable for field service nor naval use. The specifications of this gun were: overall length of fifteen feet, ten inches long; and a bore length of thirteen feet, nine inches; total <b>weight</b> <b>around</b> 50,000 pounds. This design, capable of firing either shell or shot, would be the base for most of the Rodman guns that followed.|$|E

500|$|After hatching, the chick, {{which is}} semi-altricial, is brooded and guarded {{for three weeks}} until it {{is large enough to}} defend and thermoregulate itself. During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty. After the {{brooding}} period is over, the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents. The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips, providing meals that weigh around 12% of their body <b>weight</b> (<b>around</b> [...] ). The meals are composed of fresh squid, fish and krill, as well as stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items.
