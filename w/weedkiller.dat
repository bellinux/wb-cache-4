5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a <b>weedkiller,</b> {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E

2500|$|Farmers {{had been}} {{spraying}} sodium chlorate, a government recommended <b>weedkiller,</b> onto the ragwort, {{and some of}} the spray had ended up on their clothes. [...] Sodium chlorate is a strong oxidizing agent, and reacted with the organic fibres (i.e. the wool and the cotton) of the clothes. [...] Reports had farmers' trousers variously smoldering and bursting into flame, particularly when exposed to heat or naked flames. One report had trousers that were hanging on a washing line starting to smoke. There were also several reports of trousers exploding while farmers were wearing them, causing severe burns.|$|E
2500|$|Historically {{weed control}} was by hand-pulling of weeds, often during [...] "fallowing" [...] (which means leaving {{the land to}} carry no crop for a season, during which time the weeds can be found and removed). [...] In 1896 {{it was found that}} a copper {{sulphate}} solution would kill broad-leaved weeds without seriously damaging young cereal plants. [...] Other chemical weedkillers were soon discovered and now common chemical <b>weedkiller</b> ingredients include sodium chlorate, copper chloride, sulphuric acid, dinitroorthocresol and dinitrobutylphenol. [...] Hormone-based weedkillers are used to kill weeds more selectively. [...] Although most weeds are vulnerable to {{at least one of these}} substances, eradicating all the weeds from a particular area will usually need several different weedkillers. The use of pesticides has declined, and British farmers now use about a third less pesticides than they did in 1983. The crop needing most pesticides is wheat.|$|E

50|$|When {{mixed with}} a <b>weedkiller</b> (normally as an aqua solution) the {{penetrant}} chemical causes a plant to absorb the poison in a more effective manner and so succumb more readily. Penetrants are most often used against plants {{that would otherwise be}} able to resist the <b>weedkiller.</b> Often such plants have tough leaves or shiny leaves that shed water easily.|$|E

50|$|In World War II {{soldiers}} used 40 million aerosol bombs against insects. In 1946, when aerosol bombs {{first came}} on the general market, they contained only insecticides. Soon the manufacturers of shaving soap, paint, lubricants, perfume, plant sprays, hand creams, spot removers, water repellents, <b>weedkillers,</b> and rust preventatives were packaging their products in aerosol bombs. Even whipped cream is stored in them under refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|Typically, {{the term}} {{penetrant}} when {{used for a}} biochemical agent, relates to an agrichemical that is used with a <b>weedkiller</b> or fungicide. The term seems {{to be used in}} relation to agrichemicals within English speaking countries rather than North American.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that <b>weedkillers</b> could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|R

5000|$|Lombardo {{formed the}} folk rock duo John & Mary with the classically trained Mary Ramsey, who played violin and viola for 10,000 Maniacs and sang backing vocals on the 1993 album MTV Unplugged. The pair made two {{recordings}} {{under the name}} John & Mary, Victory Gardens in 1991 and 1993's The <b>Weedkiller's</b> Daughter, called [...] "a garden of shimmering delights" [...] by the Atlanta Constitution. Both albums were released on Rykodisc and are out of print.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 March 2015, IARC {{announced}} that it had evaluated the carcinogenicity of five different pesticides and published its findings in The Lancet Oncology as well as Volume 112 of the IARC Monographs. One of the substances, the herbicide glyphosate, was classified as [...] "probably carcinogenic to humans" [...] and put into the IARC's Group 2A. Glyphosate the key ingredient in, and is sold under the brand name of Roundup, which is sold by the company Monsanto. It {{is one of the}} most heavily used <b>weedkillers</b> in the world.|$|R
5000|$|John & Mary {{was formed}} by John Lombardo and Mary Ramsey soon after they first met in Buffalo, NY in December 1989. Lombardo, one of the {{founding}} members of 10,000 Maniacs and responsible for much of their early sound, had left the band in 1986 due to [...] "creative and political" [...] differences. The pair signed with Rykodisc in 1990 and recorded their first album Victory Gardens which was released in 1991, and were the opening act for the Maniacs on the Time Capsule Tour in late 1990. They followed up with their second release, The <b>Weedkiller's</b> Daughter, also on Rykodisc, in 1993.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{chlorate}} was an extensively used <b>weedkiller</b> {{within the}} EU, up until 2009 {{when it was}} withdrawn after a decision made under terms of EU Regulations.

5000|$|In July 2007, Robert Cottage, {{a former}} BNP member, was convicted for {{possessing}} explosive chemicals {{in his home}} - described by police {{at the time of}} his arrest as the largest amount of chemical explosive of its type ever found in that country. In June 2008, Martyn Gilleard, a British Nazi sympathizer, was jailed after police found nail bombs, bullets, swords, axes and knives in his flat. Also in 2008, Nathan Worrell was found guilty of possession of material for terrorist purposes and racially aggravated harassment. He was described by anti-terror police as a [...] "dangerous individual". The court heard that police found books and manuals containing [...] "recipes" [...] to make bombs and detonators using household items, such as <b>weedkiller,</b> at Worrell's flat. In July 2009, Neil Lewington was planning on waging a terror campaign using weapons made from tennis balls and <b>weedkiller</b> against those he classified as [...] "non British".|$|E
40|$|FUNGAL DISEASES {{are one of}} {{the worst}} threats to {{cultivated}} plants. Both the amateur gardener and the arable farmer know to their cost that fungal infections can damage or destroy their plants. For a century or more the urgent economic need to understand and control diseases of crops has driven the science of plant pathology. But what the scientists had overlooked was the extent to which wild plants are also vulnerable to fungal infections, presenting an opportunity to turn fungal diseases to the farmer's advantage - as <b>weedkillers.</b> Mycoherbicides, fungi that kill weeds, promise to deliver what other herbicides cannot: a highly specific treatment aimed at a single species of weed that will leave other plants untouched...|$|R
50|$|By 1965 {{the million}} tons of superphospate dropped {{annually}} was being spread over 9 million acres (36,000 km2). The amount an aircraft dropped had increased from 2.5 tons to 8 tons and there were 10,000 privately owned airstrips for topdressing in New Zealand. Other work was also done by agricultural aircraft, as in foreign countries, particularly outside the February to May prime season. Clover seed is sown and spraying is carried out with insecticides, fungicides and <b>weedkillers</b> as well as general utility work. Aerial Topdressing has been attributed with vastly increasing agricultural production—in New Zealand alone, sheep numbers increased from 40 million to over 70 million, {{the majority of the}} increase being attributed to the increased feed that superphosphate made available.|$|R
40|$|Australians {{report the}} second highest rate of water {{consumption}} in the industrialised world, despite the continent’s generally dry conditions. With researchers suggesting that fostering social capital may encourage people {{to work together on}} environmental and sustainable initiatives, this article explores whether social capital, environmental responsibility, and socio-demographic lifestyle factors might predict environmentally-friendly or unfriendly home water use behaviours, specifically gardening and car-washing, in a drought-prone Australian community. Residents who scored higher on the Neighbourhood Connections element of social capital were more likely to wash their car in an environmentally-friendly manner. Conversely, residents who scored higher on the Proactivity element of social capital were {{more likely to engage in}} the potentially harmful gardening practice of using <b>weedkillers,</b> pesticides and herbicides. The role social capital might play in fostering – or restricting – water sustainability, as well as the implications for policy, community engagement and environmental education programmes, is discussed...|$|R
