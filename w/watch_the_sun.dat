5|$|Later, Samantha {{reveals that}} the OSes are leaving, and {{describes}} a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye, and then she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown {{for the first time}} writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the OS that she had befriended, and they go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise over the city.|$|E
5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> set.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Arias {{began work}} on Heaven's Door, a Japanese live-action feature film loosely based on the German hit Knockin' on Heaven's Door {{directed}} by Thomas Jahn and written by Jahn and actor Til Schweiger. Arias' adaptation features J-Pop heartthrob Tomoya Nagase and ingenue Mayuko Fukuda as unlikely comrades who flee the hospital where they first meet, and embark on a road-trip to reach the ocean and <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> set there {{in the short time}} they have left.|$|E
500|$|The track's second verse portrays Madonna singing: [...] "Gonna <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{going down}} / I'm not gonna run {{from all this}} madness", where [...] "she surveys her present {{condition}} but vows to keep on moving". The singer further makes {{a reference to the}} Tower of Babylon and calls attention to changes in the music industry: [...] "In a world that's changing, I'm a stranger in a strange land / There's a contradiction and I'm stuck here in between". She later concludes that: [...] "Life is like a desert, an oasis to confuse me".|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E

[...] "Through the iron-barred window," [...] he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, [...] "I can see an enclosed square of wheat [...] [...] [...] above which, in the morning, I <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise in all its glory." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was rather}} an awkward task, with the trigger {{of the gun}} always within pulling {{distance}} of the finger; but Kent was a weaver, {{and in a few}} minutes had the sailor tied hand and foot.

60|$|In this melancholy {{place they}} tarried {{but a little}} while, then, turning their backs upon it for ever, went out and climbed the granite cone to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise over the broad Zambesi.

6000|$|They built a fire, {{cooked and}} ate. The Yaqui spoke only one word: [...] "Sleep." [...] Blankets were spread. Mercedes {{dropped into a}} deep slumber, her head on Thorne's shoulder. Excitement kept Thorne awake. The two rangers dozed beside the fire. Gale shared the Yaqui's <b>watch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> began to climb and the icy edge of dawn to wear away. Rabbits bobbed their cotton tails under the mesquite. Gale climbed a rocky wall above the arroyo bank, and there, with command over the miles of the back-trail, he watched.|$|E
60|$|He {{was always}} {{up with the}} lark to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> rise red and grand over the eastern hills, and chase away the white mist from the valleys.

Many hours he idled away lying on his back, with the west wind blowing softly over him, his eye on the distant hills, where the cloud shadows swept across with slow, majestic movement, like huge ships at sea.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do {{you intend}} to do?" [...] inquired Henry Stuart, who stood on <b>the</b> deck <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> as it sank into the ocean behind a mass of golden clouds, in which, however, there were some {{symptoms}} of stormy weather.|$|R

60|$|So Lysbeth yielded, for {{the great}} peace of this lake pleased her.

Yes, she was weary, and a strange unaccustomed langour crept over her; she would rest there this night also.|$|E
60|$|Antonia was on {{the watch}} on that side.

She was walking to and fro in the dusky grove with a flower in her hair, and singing softly to herself, when suddenly, within a foot of her, the lieutenant appeared from behind a tree. She bounded aside like a startled fawn, but Heemskirk, with a lucid comprehension of what she was there for, pounced upon her, and, catching her arm, clapped his other thick hand over her mouth.|$|E
60|$|And he <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> go {{down and}} the gold sink from the peaks and the red die {{out of the west}} and the gray shadows creep out of the cañon to meet the {{twilight}} and the slow, silent, mysterious approach of night with its gift of stars.|$|R
25|$|Inti Mach'ay is {{a special}} cave used to observe the Royal Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of Qhapaq Raymi.

60|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, and a dull glow {{came into his}} gray jaws as he took it. Then he buttoned his coat and walked gravely away.
