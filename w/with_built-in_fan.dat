40|$|Combinations of {{conditional}} rewriting systems (CRSs) <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates are {{an attempt}} to make operative deduction for a subclass of the univeral Horn classes <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates and functions (in a decidable theory). CRSs <b>with</b> purely <b>built-in</b> predicates as premises has been studied widely. In this work, CRS <b>with</b> both <b>built-in</b> predicates and standard conditions (i. e., equality atoms evaluated by joinability) are investigated. A restricted subclass of universal Horn classes <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates and appropriate definitions of standard CRSs <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> predicates in a specific theory are presented. A notion of reduction and a decision procedure for universal Horn clauses whose conditions are purely built-in are analysed. Conditions for the completeness of the procedure are studied.
