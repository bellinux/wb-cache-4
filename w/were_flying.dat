5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> over this area.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{entrance}} of the People's Republic of China into the war in late November 1950, Hudner and his squadron were dispatched to the Chosin Reservoir, where an intense campaign was being fought between the People's Volunteer Army and the U.S. X Corps. Almost 100,000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15,000 U.S. troops, and the pilots on Leyte <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> dozens of close air support missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the area.|$|E

5|$|The Port Said Sector was an {{independent}} military command in the Egyptian Military, unattached to the Second Army. It incorporated Port Said, Port Fouad and their vicinity. The sector contained two infantry brigades. Military operations {{in this area}} were directed against three fortifications: Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit. As {{with the rest of}} the front, the offensive here began with a fire preparation. However, high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> through the sector's airspace, hence only direct fire guns were used to bombard Israeli positions.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E

The US Government was continuing to observe its obligations under the Accords, notwithstanding the North Vietnamese invasion. In late April the MSG Marines were ordered to abandon Marshall Hall/Marine House, their billet at 204 Hong Thap Tu Street (now 204 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai Street), and move into the recreation area in the Embassy compound.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power. Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across {{from as far away as}} mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1992, {{a pair of}} Italian Army Agusta-Bell AB-206L LongRanger {{helicopters}} operated by ECMM observers entered Croatian air space from Hungary. The helicopters were white-painted and unarmed. They <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> from the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to Zagreb via Kaposvár, Hungary. Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots were warned they {{were not allowed to}} fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they <b>were</b> <b>flying,</b> the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
5|$|The {{airborne}} division's next {{objective was}} now the airfield at Gioia del Colle. The Royal Air Force needed the airfield to bring in fighter aircraft from Sicily and support the landings at Salerno, which had not gone as expected. The Germans continued their withdrawal, and Gioia was reached over {{the night of the}} 16/17September, by the 10th and 156th Parachute battalions. The Royal Air Force took over the airfield and 48 hours later, six squadrons <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> from the base in support of Allied operations. Between 20 and 24September, the 1st Airborne Division was ordered to halt and construct defences on the approaches to Taranto, due to concerns that the Germans might launch a counterattack against the overextended unit.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} <b>were</b> <b>flying,</b> yet no one was visible on board. The enemy {{thought that they were}} made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

5|$|There was a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} at Saint-Inglevert {{during the}} First World War, {{but not on}} the site of the current airfield. In April 1918, No. 21 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF) were based at Saint-Inglevert, flying Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 aircraft. From 29 June to 23 October, No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O/400s, and in November, they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF, who <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> the same type of aircraft. Two more squadrons, No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF, were based there from 17 November, to be joined by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918, flying Sopwith Camels. All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint-Inglevert on 4 March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action. The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjević was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. Šišić was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after {{being hit by a}} fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter. His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses, as well as Željava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> to Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|After the Marianas {{began to}} come under attack, the United States {{military}} stepped up its raids on the Japanese-held islands {{which could be used}} to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas <b>were</b> <b>flying</b> from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November5 and 8. These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft. The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.|$|E
