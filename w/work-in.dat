5|$|A two-week <b>work-in</b> {{was held}} at the end of July and {{beginning}} of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the <b>work-in.</b> Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} <b>work-in</b> commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first <b>work-in,</b> the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second <b>work-in,</b> the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second <b>work-in.</b> The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second <b>work-in.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1981 season two {{separate}} <b>work-ins</b> were held, the first from 25 July to 2 August {{and the second}} from 22 August to 30 August. A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks.|$|R
50|$|Winton Basil Dean (Birkenhead, 18 March 1916Hambledon, 19 December 2013) was an English musicologist of the 20th century, {{most famous}} for his {{research}} concerning the life and <b>works—in</b> particular the operas and oratorios—of George Frideric Handel, as detailed in his book Handel's Dramatic Oratorios and Masques (1959).|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{practical}} {{use of the}} multidisciplinary approach was during World War II by {{what became known as}} the military-industrial complex. Notably, the Lockheed Aircraft Company set up its own special projects operation—nicknamed the Skunk <b>Works—in</b> 1943 to develop the XP-80 jet fighter in just 143 days.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>work-in</b> had finished, the {{boarding}} {{of the stone}} floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to £70. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first <b>work-in</b> began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini <b>work-in</b> was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
50|$|Several {{different}} kinds of houses {{can be found in}} the city. These include traditional stilted houses, western houses, modern dwellings, combined shops/houses (ruko), and even roadside shacks…many of which are unfinished <b>works-in</b> progress. A large network of open-air sewage and drainage canals line the streets and neighborhoods and connect to a large central canal that flows into the sea.|$|R
5|$|Work {{planned for}} 1985 {{included}} {{the replacement of}} the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered. Two <b>work-ins</b> were held, from 20 July to 28 July and 17 August to 26 August. Further work {{over the next two years}} saw the restoration completed in 1987.|$|R
50|$|Students in the {{creative}} writing program receive intense individualized and small group instruction {{in all aspects of}} writing, from the formulation of ideas to revising, publishing, and performing. Students participate in classes, workshops, field trips, and individual conferences with faculty members who are published authors. Students also read aloud their <b>works-in</b> progress, learn peer editing techniques, design and create their own chapbooks, and participate in several public readings. GSA writers meet and learn from a variety of visiting professional writers and guest artists.|$|R
25|$|Some {{commentators}} have remarked that the <b>work-in</b> was hugely {{successful in the}} short term. The laissez-faire, free-market ideas of many in the Conservative government were halted.|$|E
25|$|Concepts can {{be judged}} {{according}} to their use in solving problems, {{as well as for}} their use in building theories. The tension between these two motivations was especially great during the 1950s when category theory was initially developed. Enter Alexander Grothendieck, who used category theory to take compass bearings in other <b>work—in</b> functional analysis, homological algebra and finally algebraic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Like many cartoonists, Capp made {{extensive}} use of assistants (notably Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson and Frank Frazetta). During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics and other specialty <b>work—in</b> addition to the regular six dailies and one Sunday strip per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for Cream of Wheat using the Abner characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic {{in a series of}} daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks—including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, Kickapoo Joy Juice—and General Electric and Procter & Gamble products, all requiring special artwork.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his <b>works—in</b> fact, only when required by authorities.|$|R
5000|$|When {{negotiations}} fail, graduate employee unions sometimes go on strike. While {{graduate student}} unions {{can use the}} same types of strikes that other unions do, they have also made use of teach-ins, <b>work-ins,</b> marches, rallies, and grade strikes. In a grade strike, graduate students refuse to grade exams and papers and, if the strike lasts {{until the end of the}} academic term, also refuse to turn in final grades. Another form of job action is known as [...] "work-to-rule", in which graduate student instructors work exactly as many hours as they are paid for and no more.|$|R
500|$|Between the two work-ins, {{the rear}} dormer was {{completed}} and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start {{to be made}} on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second <b>work-in.</b> The boards for the cap are ½ inch (13mm) thick and [...] wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed {{at the end of the}} second <b>work-in.</b>|$|E
500|$|The [...] long {{stocks were}} made from Douglas fir. All timber had been {{pressure}} treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock {{would be up to}} 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was [...] thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the <b>work-in,</b> with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} <b>work-in,</b> the {{remainder}} of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.|$|E

Hamsun is considered the [...] "leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt {{at the turn of the}} 20th century", with works such as Hunger (1890), Mysteries (1892), Pan (1894), and Victoria (1898). His later <b>works—in</b> particular his [...] "Nordland novels"—were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour.|$|R

On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the Chicago Seven, Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Another political activist, John Sinclair, poet and co-founder of the White Panther Party, was serving ten {{years in prison for}} selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug. In December 1971 at Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15,000 people attended the [...] "John Sinclair Freedom Rally", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, and others. Lennon and Ono, backed by David Peel and Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming Some Time in New York City album including [...] "John Sinclair", whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond.

500|$|Four <b>work-ins</b> {{were held}} during 1984. The first two were by {{apprentices}} from Eastern Electricity Board. Thelnetham Windmill was chosen at {{the project to}} benefit from the Young Person's Development Project for that year. Pakenham Watermill had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that Thelnetham Windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A mains electricity supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath. The thrust borer laid [...] of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor.|$|R

A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|R
