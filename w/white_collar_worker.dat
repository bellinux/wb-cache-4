The plot consists of a series of often abstract sequences, including plot material created by stars Kaylan, Volman, Robert Ridgely, and, according to the film's ending credits, various people Swenson encountered during the making of the film.|$|E

40|$|Participation {{in labor}} unions {{has fallen to}} an all-time low among American workers. This decline has {{occurred}} {{over the same period}} of time that the American economy has shifted from industrial work characterized by blue collar labor to an economy of <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> primarily focused on providing services. Generally defined as salaried professionals, or educated workers performing semi-professional non-manual tasks, <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> have by and large not become members of labor unions. The lack of <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> unionization has contributed much to the declining role of labor unions in this country. Why have <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> resisted attempts at collective action?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{perception}} of inequality and types of reaction of <b>white</b> and blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> The research was conducted over 120 <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> and 159 blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> in an academic institution. It was determined with correlation analysis whether there is a relation between perception of inequality and reaction towards it for two groups. A significant and positive relation has been found between inequality perceptions and reaction towards inequality of blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> No significant relation has been found for <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Factor analysis was used to determine the dimensions of inequality perceptions andreactions towards inequality of blue and <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Results show that inequality perceptions and types of reactions towards inequality differ in terms of dimensions. Equity perceptions of blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> are mostly based on comparisons with colleagues and nepotist behavior of their managers. <b>White</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> show sensitivity to the issues like salary, promotion and status.

40|$|Can job {{assignment}} {{based on}} comparative advantage {{and learning about}} workers’ ability explain wage and promotion dynamics within firms?

Both measurable and unmeasurable skills are important. This holds in both occupations studied. When it comes to firms’ learning about their workers the results are not so clear.

40|$|All {{persons in}} Sweden, {{classified}} as <b>white</b> or blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the 1960 Population Census, were followed {{up for the}} period 1961 - 1973 {{with regard to the}} occurrence of cancer. The SMRs were calculated for 50 tumour sites and {{it was found that the}} crude classification of occupations into <b>white</b> or blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> was particularly important for malignant melanoma risk. The number of malignant melanoma cases among blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> was significantly lower than expected while it was significantly higher than expected among the <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> This was true for men as well as for women. The SMRs were calculated to be 87 and 141 (men) and 79 and 117 (women), respectively. Comparing the relative survival probabilities it was found that <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> had a higher probability of survival than blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> This might indicate that the difference in occurrence could be dependent on early detection as well as differential risk. The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster than any other kind of tumour in Sweden. For the period 1961 - 1970 the incidence rate increased two-fold for blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and more than two-fold for <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> (men). In absolute terms the <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the age group 45 - 64 had an appreciably faster increase in incidence over this period compared to all other groups studied. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} why blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> {{are more}} likely to organize unions than <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> by looking at commitment devices and imperfect signals on workers' actions. Under contractual incompleteness, firms cannot ex ante promise to keep employment levels high. However, if unions resist firms' dismissal policies by the request of high severance pay, unions can play a significant role as a commitment device for job security. Then, since firms can decrease wage and increase employment level, the profit of unionized firms can be more than that of non-union firms. Furthermore, we show that imperfect signals on workers' actions weakens the role of unions as a commitment device. This results in less union organizing by <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> since the efforts level of <b>white</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> is more difficult to observe than that of blue <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> ...|$|R
