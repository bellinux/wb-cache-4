500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
60|$|JAMES [heavily]. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to say. They {{are at the}} door.|$|E
60|$|BURGESS (momentously). Don't let me detain you, Mr. Mill. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{about is}} private {{between me and}} Mr. Morell.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have kept me so long had you known <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> about," [...] he said with bitterness. [...] "Still, you are worth waiting for." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL. Don't {{you be so}} saucy. You ain't heard <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> for yet. [To Mrs. Pearce, who {{is waiting}} at the door for further instruction] Did you tell him <b>I</b> <b>come</b> in a taxi? ...|$|R
60|$|BILLY. [With supreme confidence.] That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to see you}} for--to get engaged over again.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll settle both deals to-night," [...] Wright was saying. [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> for. That's why I've asked Snecker and Blome to be here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha, that's right, Maharaj,' he said, briskly. 'I do love big game. To tell yah the truth, old man, that's just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> heah for.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep in the traces, Bill," [...] replied Hawe. [...] "You savvy <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> fer. I've been bidin' my time. But I'm ready now. I'm hyar {{to arrest}} a criminal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to tell you, then you'll talk," [...] went on Dale. And hurriedly he told of Beasley's plot to abduct Al Auchincloss's {{niece and}} claim the dying man's property.|$|R
6000|$|Ellen {{whispered to}} herself: [...] "I saw him right the other day. Only, I'd not admit it.... The finest-lookin' man I ever saw {{in my life}} is a damned Isbel! Was that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> out heah for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> for {{was to ask}} if you can put on your bonnet, {{and take}} {{a walk in the}} lanes this lovely evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} permit that, Miss Lambert," [...] he earnestly said. [...] "That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to say. Don't {{allow them to}} use you so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to find out," [...] he {{answered}} deliberately. [...] "So far, I am {{inclined to think}} that it has not lasted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{let him go}} {{down the}} cabin," [...] demanded the skipper angrily. [...] "It's a fine thing I can't leave the ship {{for an hour or}} so but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back and find people sitting all round my cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|And now--if anyone shall say--This may be {{all very}} true. But what is it to me? You are talking about nature; about animals and plants, and lands and seas. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to church to hear of, is about my own soul-- ...|$|R
2500|$|... “I am {{sad because}} I have been deceived in you… <b>What!</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{to you for}} counsel, and at such a moment! — and your first word is, submit! submit! So {{this is how you}} {{translate}} your talk of independence, of sacrifice, which …” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> here for,' said Mr. Pickwick, {{handing over}} the document. 'If {{anything}} particular occurs, {{you can write}} to me at the post-office, Ipswich.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ben Greene, I {{guess you}} are right about that," [...] said the lieutenant. [...] "Will you forgive me? That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to see you about." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mavering nodded. [...] "He's {{given me}} {{three weeks to}} decide whether I {{would like to do}} that or go in for law. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up here for." ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR (gravely). My friend: <b>I</b> {{already know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think. <b>Come</b> to your offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] said Sir Tristram, [...] "the {{messenger}} whom I {{have sent}} to you hath, I believe, told you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> for, {{and that it}} is to redeem this island from your possession, and to restore it to the Lady Loise, to whom it belongeth. Likewise that <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to punish you for all the evil you have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your servant, Mrs. Loveday,' he said, 'and I {{will tell}} you at once <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> for. You will say that I take time by the forelock when I inform {{you that it is}} to push on my long-wished-for {{alliance}} wi' your daughter, as I believe she is now a free woman again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{was just}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to inquire about. What were {{they going to}} do with the Chinese {{decoration}} all over Penang? Would they try to wisely obliterate that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to explain}} to you,' replied the {{collector}} of water-rate. 'The fact is, we have thought it best to keep it secret from the family.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--everything! Well, well, well!" [...] But {{he pulled}} himself together; he began again to eat. [...] "I came back to ask you something. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, boys," [...] Old Tarwater answered, [...] "and {{thanking you}} kindly, all I {{can say is}} that a hundred {{thousand}} will do nicely, and very nicely, for a starter. Of course, I ain't goin' to stop till I get the full three hundred thousand. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> into the country for." ...|$|R
60|$|JIM. [At last] <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to tell yu. They'm all laughin' at yu. But yu'm strong--yu {{go over to}} Durford to {{that doctor}} man, an' take un like I did. [He tries again to make the sign of {{squeezing}} a man's neck] They can't laugh at yu no more, then. Tha's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to tell yu. Tha's {{the way for a}} Christian man to du. Gude naight, zurr. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to tell yee.|$|R
60|$|BERTLEY. You know that's {{not at all}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. <b>Come,</b> {{promise me}} to give it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that lately I {{have been}} forgetting how {{important}} my work really is. That is precisely <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to talk to}} you about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] she assented hurriedly, {{with what}} was {{intended}} for a smile. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to ask you is this--what are we to teach our children?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There ain't a {{thing in}} this world that you can't do with Mart Haney--not a thing. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down here to tell you--you can boss my ranch any day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, sir! your time's {{so taken}} up, I'm well aware o' that; it's {{not only what}} you hev to do, but it's goin' about from place to place; an' you don't keep a hoss, Mr. Tryan. You don't take care enough o' yourself--you don't indeed, an' that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to talk to y' about.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Jim, here's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{particular}} {{to see you}} for. I need your advice. I've got a little money. Between you and me, as friends, I've been adding some to that roll all the time. But before I lose it I want to invest some. Buy some stock or buy an interest in some rancher's herd.|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly Ann," [...] says he, very serious, [...] "I ain't a boaster. But when <b>I</b> think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> {{through to}} git here, I wonder that <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back at all. The folks shut up at Harrod's {{said it was}} sure death ter cross the {{mountains}} now. I've walked two hundred miles, and fed seven times, and my sculp's as near hangin' on a Red Stick's belt as I ever want it to be." ...|$|R
