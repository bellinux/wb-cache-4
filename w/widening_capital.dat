The project also added direct connections between the Capital Beltway and the I-95/I-395 HOV lanes.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether a}} less-{{developed}} economy {{can catch up}} with a more developed one when they compete for foreign direct investments. The main message of the paper is that jurisdictional competition can enable the lagging country to catch up if capital mobility is sufficiently high and the productivity gap is not too large. Further, we show that size asymmetry reinforces (weakens) the productivity catch-up resulting from interjurisdictional competition when the lagging economy is small (large). Finally, we demonstrate that the development gap <b>widens</b> when <b>capital</b> becomes less mobile, which {{is at odds with}} previous findings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is a {{well-known}} {{fact that one of}} the most important determinants of growth is private investment. However, in the developing country context of widespread poverty, the effects of initial conditions on the process of capital accumulation have seldom been investigated. This paper highlights heterogeneity in the process of capital accumulation across different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and derives a formal specification of investment functions in the primary, industry and service sectors in the region, using a variation of the combined Tobin's Q Theory and the neoclassical models of investment. The results highlight a more rapid accumulation of capital in the relatively high income sub-panel and a <b>widening</b> public-private <b>capital</b> accumulation gap. A functional specification points to the significance of aggregate profitability shocks, the financing cost of investment and public capital stock in estimating the growth rate of private capital accumulation. These results are supported empirically, as highlighted by the relatively small absolute deviation between actual and predicted value distributions...|$|R

Focusing on three key occupational groups - cotton manufacturers, tailors and drapers and publicans and brewers - in the industrialising town of Stockport over {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century, it demonstrates that inheritance was an important reason why many firms were 'closed'. Businesses were terminated to fund family provision strategies and to provide offspring with alienable legacies. It is suggested that such strategies led to both the recycling and eventual <b>widening</b> of business <b>capital.</b> More broadly, the article calls for business historians to assess and evaluate the strategies of small firms within the context of family ambitions and priorities, rather than against more abstract, economistic and potentially anachronistic notions of business performance. ...|$|R

First we show that, {{in the absence of}} fixed cost, the competitive equilibrium implies alternating phases of <b>capital</b> <b>widening</b> and deepening, during which a discrete amount of resorces is invested, at regular intervals in time, to move up the ladder. Next we introduce technological fixed cost and show that, when these are not too large, the same first-best efficient allocation obtains in competitive equilibrium. Finally we look at the case in which fixed cost are large and competitive equilibrium is no longer firstbest efficient. We introduce two notions of competitive equilibrium, which we deem appropriate for handling these circumstances, and show that such equilibria exist, {{there are quite a few}} of them and they can be pareto ranked. 1 1...|$|R

40|$|Growing inequalities in Europe {{are a major}} {{challenge}} threatening the sustainability of urban communities and the competiveness of European cities. While the levels of socio-economic segregation in European cities are still modest compared to {{some parts of the}} world, the poor are increasingly concentrating spatially within capital cities across Europe. An overlooked area of research, this book offers a systematic and representative account of the spatial dimension of rising inequalities in Europe. This book provides rigorous comparative evidence on socio-economic segregation from 13 European cities. Cities include Amsterdam, Athens, Budapest, London, Milan, Madrid, Oslo, Prague, Riga, Stockholm, Tallinn, Vienna and Vilnius. Comparing 2001 and 2011, this multi-factor approach links segregation to four underlying universal structural factors: social inequalities, global city status, welfare regimes and housing systems. Hypothetical segregation levels derived from those factors are compared to actual segregation levels in all cities. Each chapter provides an in-depth and context sensitive discussion of the unique features shaping inequalities and segregation in the case study cities. The main conclusion of the book is that the spatial gap between the poor and the rich is <b>widening</b> in <b>capital</b> cities across Europe, which threatens to harm the social stability of European cities. This book will be a key reference on increasing segregation and will provide valuable insights to students, researchers and policy makers who are interested in the spatial dimension of social inequality in European cities.

2500|$|To escape her father's {{influence}} and gain independence, Parnok and Volkenstein married in September 1907 {{and moved to}} Saint Petersburg. As she had suspected, living in the <b>capital</b> <b>widened</b> her circle of literary friends. She soon made friends with Liubov Gurevich, the most important women journalist {{at the time and}} the married couple, Sophia Chatskina (...) and Yakov Saker (...) [...] The couple owned the journal Northern Annals, publishing the works of poets such as Alexander Blok, Mikhail Kuzmin, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Fyodor Sologub, and Maximilian Voloshin. Parnok enrolled in the Bestuzhev Courses to study law and continued publishing poems in various journals. She also began to do translation work, having been invited in 1908 by Gurevich to co-edit a French-Russian translation of Petits poèmes en prose by Charles Baudelaire. The Baudelaire project fell apart, her Graves' disease flared up, and she became increasingly unhappy with her work. In January 1909, finding her marriage to be stifling, Parnok left her husband and settled in Moscow. Volkenstein finally agreed to a divorce in the spring, but their break-up embittered the two and their earlier friendship never recovered.|$|R
40|$|Social spaces bear {{different}} meanings, {{opportunities and}} risks {{for men and}} women and for people belonging to different ethnicities. This article focuses on how gendered and ethnicized spaces are constructed for Roma youth in migration. In a multi-sited ethnography, we explored two contexts of the lives of Roma youth in Italy: the domestic space, often shared with families or with other peers, and the urban, public space where youth participate in street occupations. Roma in Italy face harassment and discrimination, and fear of public authorities {{is an important factor in}} determining how urban space is experienced. Many families live in the “nomad camps”, specially designed areas for Roma ethnics, and experience a series of repressive measures like forced evictions and security controls in the street. Specific local legislation targets beggars as offensive to the public decorum while “gypsy pickpockets” have been used as an excuse to criminalize all Roma ethnics and gained wide press coverage. Informal occupations are a result of the exclusion from the labor market and represent economic strategies of many Roma families or individuals. Street occupations in Italy are not exclusively Roma, but common to groups with low socioeconomic status. The “street” is gendered, and while begging might conceived as a feminized activity, petty crime brings boys and girls into masculine roles. Significant levels of non-segregated social interaction takes place outside the “nomad camp”, that <b>widens</b> social <b>capital</b> in the immigration country and helps youth grow practical abilities in the absence of formal education opportunities. On the other hand, informal and illegal work exposes them to risks, from police intervention to exploitation. Gendered spaces can be determined by practices of individuals and groups as much as by structural constraints, such as political discourse and legislation. I analyze both levels in the present work: how youth change gendered spaces while they do gender and ethnicity, and how structural constraints, such as legal action, limits displays of gender and promotes discriminating discourses of ethnicity...|$|R
40|$|In this article, Someshwar Rao, Jiamin Tang and Weimin Wang of Industry Canada {{examine the}} impact of capital {{accumulation}} on Canada's recent productivity record. A key finding is that the widening of the Canada-U. S. labour productivity gap in both the business sector and in manufacturing {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s was largely due to the <b>widening</b> of the <b>capital</b> intensity gap between the two countries. Indeed, the authors find that in the business sector multifactor productivity growth in the two countries was virtually identical at around 2 per cent per year in the 1995 - 2000 period. This situation is explained by the marked slowdown in the pace of capital intensity growth in Canada after 1995. This development reflected the increased cost of capital relative to labour in Canada, in turn the result of higher prices for investment goods because of the depreciation of the Canadian dollar and low wage increases due to high unemployment. With the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar and the expected decline in unemployment, the authors project in the medium-term a narrowing of Canada's capital intensity gap with the United States and hence a reduction in the labour productivity gap.

40|$|An {{examination}} of Labour Force Survey data from May 1997 to May 2000 {{suggests that the}} long-term decline in labour force participation for older Australian men has recently abated. This shift may be already reflecting {{the emergence of a}} new set labour market conditions linked to the declining rate of growth of the Australian labour force due to population ageing. The data show that the growth in the employment of men in older age groups has exceeded the growth of these groups due to population ageing. Further, older men are satisfying employer demand in a range of occupations, including higher-skilled occupations and, in the majority of cases, on a full-time basis. The paper argues that the challenge of ensuring a vibrant and responsive economy can be met despite labour force ageing if sufficient resources are committed to Australia’s human capital development and if sufficient measures are taken to stem the incidence of early retirement. It is further argued that a decisive shift in strategic outlook by national leaders would be necessary to the success of an intensive human capital approach to maintaining productivity growth. Whereas the 1980 s and 1990 s were dominated by a preoccupation with <b>capital</b> <b>widening</b> and aggregate economic growth, premised on population growth, a human capital based response to labour market ageing would require a strategic refocussing upon per capita economic growth...|$|R

As a result, the levels of socio-economic segrega- tion are moving upwards.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} {{research}} is to investigate {{the response of the}} universities after implementing the higher education commission (HEC) reorganized policies for widening participation and improving the quality in the higher education system of Pakistan. The relationship between education and economic growth has been emphasized in the literature. The Human Capital approach that stresses the quality of the labor and the contribution of enrollments factor is used for widening participation for the economic growth of the country. The other relevant concepts of rate of return with respect to private and social benefits have been presented to smooth the trend of widening access and quality in higher education. Moreover, the experiences of central European and South East Asian countries about the expansion trends are analyzed for finding the valuable lessons. The higher education system of Pakistan with the perspectives of expansion trends and quality improvement amendments is analyzed for recognizing the HEC initiatives and outcomes. The major focus of the study is to investigate the reaction of three public sector universities after the implementation of HEC policies in 2004. The evaluative case study methodology was adopted by the researcher. The data was gathered through analysis of policy documents and interviews conducted in three public sector universities about the following issues: students? enrollments and expenditures per student. The documents like official reports, online papers and newspapers were consulted along with the interviews for getting upgraded information. The undertaken analysis has resulted in several basic findings. It has been concluded that universities are gradually increasing access opportunities by introducing new disciplines particularly, and also establishing many new higher education?s institutions for expanding participation in this decade. The establishment of quality enhancement cells along with hiring foreign faculty and PhDs in public universities are significant steps for both access and quality improvement of higher education in Pakistan.

40|$|The paper's purpose {{has evolved}} {{during the process}} of researching and writing it. In the {{beginning}} it was to investigate if art and culture could increase the strength and knowledge of a brand and if there existed a knowledge about this amongst Swedish companies, situated in Stockholm. During the process the purpose has evolved into exploring the type of companies that acknowledge this and those that don't. By using Bourdieu's terminology and tools, the reasons behind the use of art has been analyzed. The paper employs an explorative approach by accessing data through interviews and public data provided by the Internet through web pages and government files. The paper comes to the conclusion that what Holt calls cultural branding has not evolved, when looking at the companies that are accurate for this study. Out of 24 companies only one comes close to observing socio cultural movements through the arts. The rest are occupied with emotional branding. To reach a level where a person or a company actually uses art to add emotions to the brand in a strategic way, that person, and the company {{as an extension of the}} persons habitus, need to have a large accumulated bank of cultural capital and be able to use it in social events to <b>widen</b> their social <b>capital</b> and therefore realize the possibilities of gaining from these relationships in a monetary capital sense. Art is also used in an unconscious way to add to the holistic brand. When the act is not done with a strategic plan in mind, it is explained by the fact that these individuals lack cultural capital that is evaluated by the group at large. The study of the field indicates that a movement is made from the economic field into the cultural without an equal movement in the other direction. In the economic sector cultural capital seems to be important and the Swedish cultural field contains smaller fields in the field, for example the tribe that hold the power. This tribe is well entangled in both the top hierarchy of the economic and the cultural field...|$|R
40|$|The Austrian {{system of}} {{severance}} pay {{is the subject}} of two reform proposals currently before Parliament. Their effects on the development of labour costs largely depend on the level of severance pay under the current legislation and the provisions already built up on the balance sheets of firms. In the absence of official records, estimates have to be used for both figures. Based on the distribution of wages over the duration of employment, WIFO estimates current severance payments at 2. 3 percent of wages and salaries, which corresponded to a total of ATS 19. 2 billion in 1997. Provisions for severance payments on the balance sheets of firms are estimated at ATS 75, 2 billion, the stock of assets covering such provisions being ATS 37, 6 billion (1997). These numbers do not include voluntary severance payments beyond the statutory obligation. On the basis of these initial values, the reform proposal introduced by the Social Democratic Party requires a transition period of 15 years to take full effect, whereas the proposal submitted by the People's Party assumes a maximum of 40 years (excluding voluntary change-over to the new system). A fixed contribution rate of 2. 5 percent of wages and salaries, as provided for in the ÖVP proposal, will result in a reduction of long-term labour costs. In the short to medium term, however, transition costs will arise. The SPÖ proposal will increase labour costs due to severance pay drastically in the short term and slightly in the long term. Compared with the current situation, the change-over to a contribution-based system encompassing all employees will not be neutral with respect to different sectors of the economy. Labour costs in seasonal sectors or sectors with a high mobility of labour will increase significantly. The budgetary effects for public households will be positive in the long run, since interest on <b>capital</b> <b>widens</b> the base for taxation, but negative in the short term. Due to deferred taxation, tax revenues under the new system will be lower in the initial years after its introduction. The current system of severance pay imposes a heavy burden on the liquidity management of firms. Payments are made in the form of lump sums at the termination of an employment contract. The change to a contribution-based system will smooth the demand for liquidity and therefore facilitate financial planning. This will be of advantage, above all, for highly leveraged firms and firms in financial trouble. Consequently, the number of insolvencies ought to decline over time. A transition phase with high additional costs due to the co-existence of the old and new systems will be a considerable challenge to liquidity management. Small retail and manufacturing businesses are likely to encounter difficulties under such a scenario.
