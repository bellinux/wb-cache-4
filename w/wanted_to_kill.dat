5|$|A year passes. Peter {{has begun}} dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois {{from time to}} time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie {{indirectly}} reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and angered, Brian vows to bring him to justice. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' trash and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but {{it was clear that he}} had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E

5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill,</b> and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisia battle {{sequence}} {{that opened the}} film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007, and between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that {{they knew how to}} adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million.|$|E
