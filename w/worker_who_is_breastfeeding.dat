40|$|Excerpt] The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality of the European Parliament (FEMM) asked Eurofound {{to conduct}} a study on {{national}} regulations regarding maternity leave {{against the background of}} the possible revision of the Maternity Leave Directive (92 / 85 /EEC). Eurofound accepted the FEMM Committee’s request within its ‘Stakeholder enquiry service’ and drew upon recent information provided by its Network of European correspondents. It is important to note, in this regard, that the scope of the terms used regarding ‘maternity leave’ in national systems is rather different. While some Member States distinguish explicitly between pregnancy leave and maternity leave (exclusively reserved for mothers) and later on between maternity leave and parental leave (which can be shared between both parents), other Member States use one overall term and regulation for leave that can be used by both parents (albeit with certain periods reserved for either parent). In addition, several Member States also have periods of paternity leave, which are exclusively reserved for the father (see Eurofound, 2015). Against the background of the scope of the Maternity Leave Directive 92 / 85 /EEC, this study is primarily interested in the part of leave which is related to women in employment – in particular, pregnant <b>workers,</b> <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> have recently given birth or <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>breastfeeding.</b> In this sense, the report focuses mainly on leave periods around childbirth to be used by the mother. A complete picture, including parental leave provision, can be obtained from the country profiles produced by Eurofound’s European Observatory of Working Life – EurWORK (forthcoming summer 2015) ...|$|R

40|$|Background Exclusive {{breastfeeding}} for {{six months}} is recommended by the World Health Organisation and the NHS. Mothers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> need the appropriate support and guidance from health professionals {{in order for them}} to continue breastfeeding. Staff on paediatric wards come into contact with many infants under the age of six months and therefore need a high standard of knowledge so that they can support and advise mothers on the ward appropriately. However evidence suggests that some health professionals do not have the knowledge to be able to support mothers. Method A survey questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff on the paediatric wards at Nottingham Children’s Hospital to assess their attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding, along with their confidence levels when supporting mothers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>breastfeeding.</b> The results <b>were</b> analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results Sixty-seven nursing staff out of 240 responded from twelve wards. There was a positive correlation between attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding. Personal experience of <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>was</b> shown to increase knowledge and confidence when supporting mothers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>breastfeeding.</b> There <b>was</b> no statistical difference between qualified nurses, care support workers or student nurses and attitudes towards and knowledge of breastfeeding or confidence levels. Conclusion The study highlighted that although knowledge was high, there were some gaps, and although attitudes towards <b>breastfeeding</b> <b>were</b> positive, there were some exceptions. Personal experience increased knowledge and confidence and therefore needs to be taken into consideration when creating a training programme for the staff. Ensuring training is given as part of an induction will help to increase new staffs knowledge and attitudes towards breastfeeding, as well as their confidence when supporting mothers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> which <b>is</b> crucial...|$|R
