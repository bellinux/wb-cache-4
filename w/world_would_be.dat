5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or {{the best of all possible}} worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
5|$|For {{the western}} localization, the Square Enix staff used {{analysis}} from their subsidiary companies in London and Los Angeles to readjust {{the game for}} Western audiences. Director Takeshi Arakawa and producer Yoshinori Kitase announced that the release date for the western <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> August 25, 2009 (starting in North America), {{and that it will}} include a number of small changes, including re-adjustments in gameplay, new gameplay events, an arcade gameplay mode, a shortened tutorial, new moves for playable characters, and extra cutscenes featuring cameos from several other characters from the main characters' original games that do not appear in the Japanese version. Arakawa referred to the Western version as a more action-based game than the original Japanese version which was more RPG-based.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, {{discussed}} {{the matter of}} command arrangements in the Pacific in Washington, D.C., on 9 March. Roosevelt proposed that the <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> divided into British and American areas of responsibility, with the United States having responsibility for the Pacific, where {{there would be an}} American supreme commander responsible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Churchill responded favourably to the proposal, and the governments of Australia and New Zealand were then consulted. They endorsed the idea of an American supreme commander, but wanted to have some input into matters of strategy.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the <b>world,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> without outliers like Björk.|$|E

25|$|President Toda's linking of Makiguchi's {{progressive}} {{ideals and}} Nichiren Shōshū institutions created an immensely effective, if inherently unstable alliance, {{which resulted in}} periodic outbreaks of tension between the priesthood and the laity.
