5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb.

5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, <b>where</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
