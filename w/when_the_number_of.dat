5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge.

40|$|This paper {{studies in}} a multiple-winner contest setting how the total efforts may vary between a grand contest {{and a set}} of subcontests.

In other words, the total efforts of a contest exhibit a striking "increasing return to scale" property: <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> contestants and prizes scale up proportionally, the total efforts of the contest increase more than proportionally. Thus, the total efforts must increase when a set of identical subcontests are merged into a grand contest. Equivalently, the total efforts decrease when a grand contest is evenly divided. We further allow the grand contest to be split into uneven subcontests. We show that under a mild and plausible condition (regular contest technology), the grand contest generates more efforts as compared to any split contests. ...|$|R

30|$|For the Monte Carlo method, the RD% is {{less than}} 5 % for α and n <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> {{simulation}} are ≥ 100 and 200, respectively. For the bootstrap method, the RD% {{is less than}} 5 % for α and n <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> simulation are ≥ 500 and 400, respectively.

In this sense, the Monte Carlo method may {{be better than the}} bootstrap method. However, <b>the</b> optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> simulation may also differ with specific situations. For example, Efron and Tibshirani (1993) stated that a minimum of approximately 1000 bootstrap re-samples was sufficient to obtain accurate confidence interval estimates.

There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
