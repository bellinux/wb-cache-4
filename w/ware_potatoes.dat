40|$|Improving the {{introduction}} of new potato varieties requires aligning the preferences of all supply chain actors. In Ethiopia, the majority of <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> growers source their seed from the informal supply system. Using a case study on specialised seed growers and a survey among <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> growers and downstream chain actors, we explore the quality attributes that could influence the variety choices of farmers and downstream actors. Especially, we analysed the link between the seed and <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> supply chains, farmers’ evaluation of local and improved potato varieties, and quality differences between the local and improved varieties. We found that farmers’ variety choices are well-aligned with traders’ preferences but varieties supplied by the specialised seed potato growers are not well accepted by <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> growers. As a result, <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> farmers continue to grow local varieties, which are inferior in terms of production-related quality attributes, but superior regarding market-related quality attributes. The results imply that enhancing production-related quality attributes is not enough to induce farmers to accept new potato varieties. We recommend breeding institutes and seed potato growers to put more emphasis on market-related quality attributes to enhance choice alignment in the full potato chain...|$|R

40|$|Arable farming {{systems in}} the Netherlands are {{characterized}} by crop rotations in which potato, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley {{are the most important}} crops. The objectives of this study were to decompose crop yield gaps within such rotations into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps and to explain those yield gaps based on observed cropping frequencies and alternative farmers' objectives. Data from specialized Dutch arable farms between 2008 and 2012 were used. Production frontiers and efficiency yield gaps were estimated using the stochastic frontier framework. The resource yield gap was quantified through the estimation of highest farmers' yields (Y HF, average across farms with actual yields above the 90 th percentile). Crop model simulations and variety trials were compiled to assess climatic potential yields (Yp) and technology yield gaps. The contribution of crop area shares and farmers' objectives to actual yields were assessed using regression analysis and based on five different farm level indicators (N production, energy production, gross margin, nitrogen-use efficiency and labour use), respectively. The average yield gap per crop (as percentage of Yp which is given in parentheses) was: 29. 2 % (of 72. 6 t ha − 1) for <b>ware</b> <b>potato,</b> 39. 7 % (of 71. 6 t ha − 1) for starch potato, 26. 4 % (of 107. 1 t ha − 1) for sugar beet, 32. 3 % (of 88. 3 t ha − 1) for spring onion, 25. 2 % (of 12. 3 t ha − 1) for winter wheat and 37. 5 % (of 10. 4 t ha − 1) for spring barley. The efficiency yield gap ranged between 6. 6 % (starch potato) and 18. 1 % (spring onion) of Yp. The resource yield gap was lower than 10 % of Yp for all the crops and the technology yield gap ranged between 7. 1 % (<b>ware</b> <b>potato)</b> and 30. 7 % of Yp (starch potato). There were statistically significant effects of potato (positive quadratic) and onion (positive) area shares on <b>ware</b> <b>potato,</b> sugar beet and winter wheat yields, of sugar beet area share (positive quadratic) on winter wheat yield and of cereal area share (negative) on sugar beet and winter wheat yields. Farmers' objectives explain part of the variability observed in crop yields which were 7 – 24 %, 13 – 24 % and 12 – 32 % lower than Y HF, respectively, for gross margin maximising, labour minimising and N use efficiency maximising farms. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between gross margin and the yield of <b>ware</b> <b>potato,</b> sugar beet and winter wheat. By contrast, no significant relationships were found between crop yields and NUE or labour use. We conclude that most of the yield gap is explained by the efficiency yield gap for <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> and spring onion and by both the efficiency and technology yield gaps for sugar beet and cereals. The resource yield gap explains most of the yield gap of seed potato, and the technology yield gap of starch potato. The results regarding the effects of cropping frequency and crop rotations to crop yields are not very conclusive which suggest that agronomic principles become less evident at 'systems level’ given the number of interacting factors at crop rotation level. Finally, although N and energy production are lower for gross margin maximising farms, most crop yields are not significantly different between farms with the highest N and energy production compared to farms performing best on economic (gross margin) objectives. </p...|$|R

40|$|Seed {{systems have}} an {{important}} role in the distribution of high-quality seed and improved varieties. The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new approach for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (Consorcio de Productores de Papa [CONPAPA]) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then, we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions such as training, monitoring, and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders.

Their main purpose is to support decision making {{whether or not to}} apply variable nitrogen fertilisation. The methodology is based on biophysical simulation of crop growth and nitrogen leaching (WAVE) in combination with economic optimisation (linear programming) and enables a normative environmental-economic evaluation of site specific N-management to be made. The partial results of a case study with an input-intensive and an input-extensive crop (<b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> and winter wheat, respectively) showed that site specific nitrogen management led to positive returns over variable costs compared to uniform N-application, conditional on the validity of the WAVE model used in simulating yield effects. The investments that could be allowed for at maximum were 6, 300 Dfl and 13, 500 Dfl for winter wheat and <b>ware</b> <b>potato,</b> respectively, assuming application to an area of 100 ha. A pollution tax or a tax on nitrogen designed to internalise pollution costs in agricultural production raises these maximum amounts to 7, 600 and 33, 700 Dfl, respectively. Practical feasibility requires site-specific nitrogen management to be integrated with time specific management since optimal N-tracks were found to be highly weather dependent. Besides, spatially variable management cannot be achieved unless good farming practices (soil testing and crop scouting) are already in place...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{current market}} for {{agricultural}} products is creating new challenges and opportunities for (smallholder) producers in many developing countries. Their ability {{to compete in the}} market is limited by new constraints related to product quality characteristics and the prevalence of market imperfection. The paper aims to assess the role of seed/ware potato cooperatives with respect to quality improvement, market access, and transaction costs. Research methodology – We draw our conclusion based on an in-depth analysis of five cooperatives found in the central and southern parts of Ethiopia. Findings – the case study result suggests that members of seed potato cooperatives were able to benefit more than members of the <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> producing cooperatives in terms of receiving technical assistance (related to seed quality), accessing better market opportunities, and reducing transaction costs. This perhaps explains why there are relatively many seed potato coops and almost no <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> coops in the country where nearly 27, 000 primary coops reportedly exists. However, recent trends show that the seed market is also highly constrained by a thin market environment. The private sector’s involvement in the seed market is negligible leaving the sustainability of the market in doubt. It was also shown that the involvement of an international agribusiness firm in the potato sector in some parts of Ethiopia under out growers’ scheme brought better opportunities for potato growers in reducing transactional risks associated to market access. However, that requires a coordinated effort between the agribusiness firm and external parties (NGOs & GOs) with the former focusing on technical assistance and marketing activities and the latter on input provision necessary for potato production...|$|R

40|$|The 2006 - 2011 {{period has}} been marked by {{increased}} volatility in food an agricultural commodity prices at a global level. In the EU, the continuous liberalization of agricultural markets under the Common Agricultural Policy has led to the exposure of EU agricultural to increasing market price volatility. This thesis has investigated the transmission and management of price volatility in EU food supply chains. The transmission of price volatility in various food supply chains is first investigated through a literature review followed by an empirical analysis of price volatility transmission {{in the case of the}} German fresh pork supply chain. The effect of market power was also taken into account in the latter empirical analysis. Next, the management of price volatility was investigated through interviews conducted with actors of selected EU food supply chains. This was followed by the analysis of the effectiveness of selected price volatility management strategies. Lastly, in light of the policy support for agricultural insurance within the Common agricultural policy, premium rates of an agricultural revenue insurance contract were calculated for the Dutch <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> sector.   One of the gaps identified in the reviewed literature is the lack of attention given to the effects of contextual factors on price volatility transmissions in food supply chains. Contextual factors include market power in the chain and pricing strategies (e. g. contracts) by chain actors. Results of the price volatility transmission analysis conducted in this thesis in the case of the German pork chain show that retail market power limited both the transmission of price levels and price volatility. This thesis shows that price volatility is perceived as risky by all actors in the food supply chain. Deviations of prices by more than 10 to 15 % from expected levels were perceived as price volatility by a majority of the chain actors. Results further show that price volatility management strategies in EU food chains are diverse and well beyond traditional instruments such as futures and forward contracts. Contrary to expectations, price fixing contracts were not found to be desirable by interviewed chain actors. This thesis also found that the effectiveness of contracts in reducing price volatility depended on how the contract price was set.   Results of this thesis further show that premium rates of a revenue insurance contract for the Dutch <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> sector across categories of farms. The average premium rates calculated were 32. 1 %, 22. 2 %, 33. 1 % and 24. 0 % on guaranteed revenue per hectare for the high expected yield, low expected yield, high yield variance to expected yield ratio and low yield variance to expected yield ratio categories of farm, respectively.

40|$|In the {{arable farming}} region Flevoland in The Netherlands climate change, {{including}} extreme events and pests and diseases, will likely pose risks {{to a variety}} of crops including high value crops such as seed <b>potato,</b> <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> and seed onion. A well designed adaptation strategy at the farm level can reduce risks for farmers in Flevoland. Currently, most of the impact assessments rely heavily on (modelling) techniques that cannot take into account extreme events and pests and diseases and cannot address all crops, and are thus not suited as input for a comprehensive adaptation strategy at the farm level. To identify major climate risks and impacts and develop an adaptation measure portfolio for the most relevant risks we complemented crop growth modelling with a semi-quantitative and participatory approach, the Agro Climatic Calendar (ACC), A cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder workshops were used to identify robust adaptation measures and design an adaptation strategy for contrasting scenarios in 2050. For Flevoland, potential yields of main crops were projected to increase, but five main climate risks were identified, and these are likely to offset the positive impacts. Optimized adaptation strategies differ per scenario (frequency of occurrence of climate risks) and per farm (difference in economic loss). When impacts are high (in the + 2 °C and A 1 SRES scenario) drip irrigation was identified as the best adaptation measure against the main climate risk heat wave that causes second-growth in seed and <b>ware</b> <b>potato.</b> When impacts are smaller (the + 1 °C and B 2 SRES scenario), other options including no adaptation are more cost-effective. Our study shows that with relatively simple techniques such as the ACC combined with a stakeholder process, adaptation strategies can be designed for whole farming systems. Important benefits of this approach compared to modelling techniques are that all crops can be included, all climate factors can be addressed, and a large range of adaptation measures can be explored. This enhances that the identified adaptation strategies are recognizable and relevant for stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Food-supply chains {{have become}} {{extensively}} vertically coordinated {{through the use}} of contracts as an organizational response to satisfy the needs of consumers in the saturated food markets of the industrialized countries.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to evaluate the effect of different mulch materials on the occurrence of Colorado Potato Beetle, weed biomass and especially on the yield of <b>ware</b> <b>potatoes.</b> The experiment with different types of mulching (grass mulch, black textile mulch, non-mulched control) and 2 varieties (Finka and Katka) was carried out under organic system in 2009. The {{results showed that the}} grass mulch was the best mulching material for reaching the highest yield, where an increase of the yield of ware tubers by 6. 6 - 7. 8 t/ha in comparison with non-mulched control variant was observed. In {{the experiment}} the mulching of organic potatoes had a positive effect on a lower activity of an oviposition of Colorado Potato Beetle and a consecutive occurrence larvae by the variant with the grass mulch, a lower weed infestation by the variant with the black mulch textile in comparison with non-mulched control...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interaction}} of marketing channel members {{and the influence of}} these interactions on incentives, coordination costs, and risk allocation strategies in a food marketing channel. For this purpose we specify a three-stage principal-agent marketing channel model involving producers, wholesalers, retailers and a futures market. We compare the situation with and without futures market. The empirical results regarding the Dutch <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> marketing channel during 1971 - 2003 reveals that, possibly as a result of increases in incentives to producers and wholesalers, the coordination costs of the marketing channel decreased significantly, both with and without futures trade. The coordination costs of a marketing channel with a futures market are lower than without futures, demonstrating the price discovery role of the futures markets. The results also show that risk shifted from retailers to producers and wholesalers. Contracts, Risks, Coordination Costs, Futures Markets, Food Marketing Channels, Agribusiness, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the Total Glycoalcaloid (TGA), nitrite, and nitrate contents of some Hungarian and foreign potato cultivars {{in relation to the}} effect of different combination of fertilisers and green manure, late blight management strategies (none, programmed, or prediction based spraying), and irrigation regime for three years. The Hungarian cultivars have exotic potato species like S. acaule, S. demissum, S. stoloniferum, S. vernei, or S. tub. ssp. andigenum in their genetic background as sources of resistance genes. No effect of fertilisers or irrigation was found on the level of glycoalkaloids and nitrate contents, which were influenced mostly by the genotype and season. In conclusion, the absolute amount and the presence of different antinutritive components of potato tubers were influenced by the technology, genotype, and season in a complex manner. These results in general prove that <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> production utilising intensive commercial agrotechnical practices and common cultivars is safe regarding the nitrate and TGA content of tubers...|$|R
40|$|Seed potato {{systems in}} East Africa are {{described}} {{and opportunities for}} improvement identified {{on the basis of}} interviews with potato producers in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, and an assessment of Ralstonia solanacearum and virus disease levels in Kenya. 3 % of seed potato sold in Kenyan markets was virus free. Ralstonia solanacearum was found in 74 % of potato farms. Less than 5 % of the farmers interviewed source seed potato from specialized seed growers. Over 50 % rely entirely on farm-saved seed. Current seed potato prices justify this behavior. To improve the system the local and specialized chain need to be tackled simultaneously. To improve the local chain <b>ware</b> <b>potato</b> farmers require training on seed quality maintenance and managing bacterial wilt and viruses. Research into virus resistance and the effect of mixed virus infection on yield deserves attention. Private investment in seed potato production could increase volumes produced and reduce price...|$|R
