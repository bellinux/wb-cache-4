We provide a simple framework to analyze the impact of UC on the allocation of workers between formal and informal activities, as well as the allocation of workers between sectors featuring different incentives to go informal. We show that a reasonable amount of UC may reduce informality, while larger amounts of UC induce large disincentives to go formal because of the level of taxation involved. We also argue that the financing of UC should be part and parcel of a well- conceived UC system. We show that UC finance based on payroll taxes is likely to entail an excess level of informality resulting from cross-subsidies between heterogenous sectors. The introduction of a simple layoff tax meant to finance the UC system is then shown to reduce informality, hence highlighting how a <b>well-designed</b> financing <b>scheme</b> may be used as a supplementary instrument to curb informality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{upcoming}} very high-speed WLANs {{the physical}} layer (PHY) rate may reach 600 Mbps. To achieve high efficiency at the {{medium access control}} (MAC) layer, we identify fundamental properties that must be satisfied by any CSMA/CA based MAC layer and develop a novel scheme called Aggregation with Fragment Retransmission (AFR). In the AFR scheme, multiple packets are aggregated into and transmitted in a single large frame. If errors happen during the transmission, only the corrupted fragments of the large frame are retransmitted. An analytic model is developed to evaluate the throughput and delay performance of AFR over a noisy channel, and to compare AFR with competing schemes in the literature. Optimal frame and fragment sizes are calculated using this model. Transmission delays are minimised by using a zero-waiting mechanism where frames are transmitted immediately once the MAC wins a transmission opportunity. We prove that zerowaiting can achieve maximum throughput. As a complement to the theoretical analysis, we investigate by simulations the impact of AFR {{on the performance of}} realistic application traffic with diverse requirements. We have implemented the AFR scheme in the NS- 2 simulator and present detailed results for TCP, VoIP and HDTV traffic. The AFR scheme described was developed as part of the 802. 11 n working group work.
