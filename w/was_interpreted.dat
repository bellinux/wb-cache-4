5|$|Homology was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he systematically compared the skeletons {{of birds and}} humans. The pattern of similarity <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{as part of the}} static great chain of being through the mediaeval and early modern periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Burke {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for Cook County State's Attorney.

5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry divisions {{were assigned to the}} defense of this area. Three of these divisions were released for other operations in March 1945 after the American invasion of Iwo Jima <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as evidence that the Hong Kong-Canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in South Dakota, United States, <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as including a fossilized heart.

5|$|The {{trial of}} those charged with {{involvement}} in the coup occurred {{more than two years}} later in mid-1963.

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% empty space.|$|E
5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people who}} come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city {{at the end of an}} unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
50|$|As XOR can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as binary {{addition}} {{and a pair}} {{of values}} can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a point in two-dimensional space, the steps in the algorithm can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as 2&times;2 matrices with binary values.

50|$|Only the {{activity}} bit <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{independently of the}} two other bits.

5000|$|Furthermore, {{the notion}} of a part of speech can be {{somewhat}} complicated in Inuit language. Fully inflected verbs can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> as nouns.

5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{as a challenge to}} the authorities and he was subjected to a number of attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows {{from one side of the}} heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

5|$|Samson {{has been}} {{especially}} honored in Russian artwork because the Russians defeated the Swedes in the Battle of Poltava on the feast day of St. Sampson, whose name is homophonous with Samson's. The lion slain by Samson <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> to represent Sweden, {{as a result of}} the lion's placement on the Swedish coat of arms. In 1735, C. B. Rastrelli's bronze statue of Samson slaying the lion was placed in the center of the great cascade of the fountain at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, {{in the heavens}} and on the earth, to welcome the final {{incarnation}} of the Bodhisattva. Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth {{in the shape of}} white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died suddenly and separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and foremost in times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} <b>was</b> <b>interpreted</b> as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E
