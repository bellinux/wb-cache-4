5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service. The advances in machinery and armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily the equal of even a modern armoured cruiser, and <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought {{played a major role in}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with deeply carved river valleys.|$|E
5|$|The GPS {{navigation}} system <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> redesigned. A {{liquid crystal display}} with touchscreen on the upper center console served as interface. First LS with voice controlled navigation. First system featuring DVD (instead of CD-ROM) maps on a luxury sedan.|$|E

5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{the display}} <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> renovated. The {{destroyed}} limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of Derbyshire limestone, many weighing over , rebuilt {{according to a}} small model made from {{the same number of}} polystyrene blocks. Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{the local}} McDonald's <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> rebuilt. The new {{building}} decor features memorabilia of Como {{along with that}} of fellow singer and Canonsburg native, Bobby Vinton. A children's playground in Canonsburg on Giffin Avenue is also named for Como. In downtown Canonsburg, all of the tree grates are marked with information about the records that sold a million copies and the town clock hourly plays one of the hits of Como (141), Vinton (44), or the Four Coins (7), also from Canonsburg.|$|E
5|$|That shot <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E
5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E

Within four days Arnhem <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> under Allied control, allowing the Canadians to advance further into the Netherlands. Less than two weeks after the battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country to an end and on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army. Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E
5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that {{she did have a}} fair degree of talent. But Scott <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a driving force {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating new roads, railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{relied on}} {{military}} assistance from Sweden, and Eljas Erkko {{took part in}} the Stockholm assembly of Scandinavian leaders between 18 October and 19 October. There, Erkko met the Swedish foreign minister Rickard Sandler in private, and Sandler assured him that he would persuade the Swedish government to assist Finland during a possible war. During the actual war, however, Sandler failed in this task and resigned. Finland <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> isolated by a German and Soviet blockade, and attempted in October to obtain arms and ammunition in absolute secrecy by enlisting the German arms dealer Josef Veltjens.|$|E

5|$|The {{defenders}} {{expected the}} German and Ottoman attack {{to be one}} of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and make it very difficult for them to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} seriously {{weakened the}} structure of the facility, leaving it highly unstable, and there was extensive smoke damage. The packaging area <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed and in all, 12% of the refinery was demolished by the explosion. Removal of debris began the day after the accident, with assistance from structural engineers. The six missing persons were all found dead that day, three of them in tunnels running beneath the factory. The final death toll was thirteen. It was the first major shutdown of a US sugar refinery since American Sugar Refining Inc.'s Domino Sugar shut down its plant in Chalmette, Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|The {{merchant}} ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a decoy ship {{to confuse the}} Axis where Hermes was actually operating. The superstructure was mainly a wooden mock-up. She {{was a part of}} the phantom fleet of mock-up British warships designated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back to a {{merchant ship}}, the decoy Hermes hit a submerged wreck and ran aground off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before being refloated she <b>was</b> <b>totally</b> disabled by German E-boats commanded by Niels Bätge. The Germans initially thought they had sunk an aircraft carrier.|$|E
