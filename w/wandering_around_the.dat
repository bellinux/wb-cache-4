5|$|With his dog, Max obtains {{a weapon}} and clothes from a dead Wastelander. <b>Wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> desert, Max finds an overzealous, hunchbacked {{mechanic}} named Chumbucket (Jason Spisak) who calls him the Driver. Chumbucket leads Max to Scrotus and the War Boys {{and tells him}} that he built a car, the Magnum Opus, which has a few missing parts; Max agrees to search for them. Max must first liberate Wasteland leaders' territories from the War Boys: Jeet (Josh Keaton), whose stronghold is in an old lighthouse, and Gut Gash (Liam O'Brien), whose followers believe {{that they will be}} protected from a flood in their ship stronghold. His stronghold is the remains of an oil tanker. He must penetrate the Jaw, a massive gate protected by War Boys, with the Magnum Opus outfitted with the Thunderpoon (an exploding harpoon). Max and Chumbucket must then save Pink Eye (Adrienne Barbeau), a woman whose mechanical skill rivals Chumbucket's, from an invasion led by Stank Gum—one of Scrotus' Top Dogs—of her silo base.|$|E

Hindman later found some more horses and sent a team back to recover one of the prized British 24-pounder guns. The team was captured by British parties who were <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Gordon's attack {{began to}} founder. His three 100-man {{detachments}} were <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rear area in confusion and many had stopped {{to satisfy their}} hunger with captured Federal rations. And the main Union defense force was beginning to mobilize. Maj. Gen. John G. Parke of the IX Corps acted decisively, ordering the reserve division under Brig. Gen. John F. Hartranft to close the gap. Hartranft organized defensive forces that completely ringed the Confederate penetration by 7:30a.m., stopping it {{just short of the}} military railroad depot. The Union artillery, aware that Confederates occupied the batteries and Fort Stedman, launched punishing fire against them. By 7:45a.m., 4,000 Union troops under Hartranft were positioned in a semicircle of a mile and a half, and counterattacked, causing heavy casualties to the now-retreating Confederates.|$|E

The shoot involved the group dressed in winter coats, <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio against a green screen, interspersed with close-up camera angles, so that the backdrop could be superimposed later. To achieve the effect of the wind blowing slowly through their hairs, the group was required to lip-synch the song in double time while wind machines were on them.|$|E

McNamara sent his two teenage sons in his utility truck to York to alert the police. McNamara and Inkpen then set out on foot {{in the direction of the}} fire. As there was bright moonlight, they were able to hurry through the bush. After about half an hour, they came upon a scene of devastation.

He gave his name and explained that he had been a passenger on a large aircraft. He had survived the crash despite being badly burned. No one else was found alive.|$|E
500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me.

You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{traditional}} Western vampires, Marceline subsists off {{shades of}} the color red, including [...] "low-grade" [...] shades such as pink. Since she is only sated by the color itself, blood is appealing to her simply because it is red. However, Ward has noted that she [...] "drinks blood sometimes". When Marceline is deprived of red, she enters into a [...] "feral" [...] state, and will instinctively try to kill others and drink their blood. Like traditional Western vampires, she is vulnerable to sunlight and is capable of turning into a bat of varying size. Marceline also possesses several powers, such as levitation, invisibility, the ability to shape-shift, and self-healing; she gained each of these powers after absorbing the essence of several powerful vampires, as documented in Stakes. Marceline is also a survivor of the Mushroom War. Hints of her past are sprinkled through the series; in [...] "Memory of a Memory" [...] a trip into Marceline's mind shows her as a child <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of a destroyed city, and [...] "I Remember You" [...] features her meeting Simon Petrikov in a ruined city.|$|E
500|$|A Fukme 99 {{directed}} {{video was}} {{included on the}} DVD version of Rings Around the World on its release in July 2001. The video begins with the phrase [...] "Get real!" [...] in pink letters and features three people, dressed in cardboard costumes as a camcorder, clapperboard and microphone respectively, <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> streets of Hammersmith. The camcorder is refused entry into a shop and is taunted by schoolchildren while the clapperboard is told to leave {{the scene of a}} film by one of the crew. The microphone is shown attempting to hand out flyers alongside a man dressed in a banana costume who is much more successful at getting people to take the leaflets from him. The camcorder, microphone and clapperboard then meet up in a car park before going to the house of a man with a large cardboard head and arms. The four walk towards some warehouses where they dance with several other people dressed in cardboard, including a mobile phone and camera, as well as the man dressed as a banana who appeared earlier in the video. Rhys has described this sequence as a [...] "big dance routine with ... cardboard outsiders".|$|E
500|$|Trade {{and crafts}} are {{extremely}} important to the local tourism-fueled economy. There are 18 souks in Marrakesh, employing over 40,000 people in pottery, copperware, leather and other crafts. The souks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian-style scarves imported from India or China. Local boutiques are adept at making western-style clothes using Moroccan materials. The Birmingham Post comments: [...] "The souk offers an incredible shopping experience with a myriad of narrow winding streets that lead {{through a series of}} smaller markets clustered by trade. Through the squawking chaos of the poultry market, the gory fascination of the open-air butchers' shops and the uncountable number of small and specialist traders, just <b>wandering</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> streets can pass an entire day." [...] Marrakesh has several supermarkets including Marjane Acima, Asswak Salam and Carrefour, and three major shopping centres, [...] Al Mazar Mall, Plaza Marrakech and Marjane Square; a branch of Carrefour opened in Al Mazar Mall in 2010. Industrial production in the city is centred in the neighbourhood of Sidi Ghanem Al Massar, containing large factories, workshops, storage depots and showrooms. Ciments Morocco, a subsidiary of a major Italian cement firm, has a factory in Marrakech. The AeroExpo Marrakech International Exhibition of aeronautical industries and services is held here, as is the Riad Art Expo.|$|E
