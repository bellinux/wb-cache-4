5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|During World War I he {{had been}} elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox {{intended}} to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> a living, and his contribution to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|But I {{must not}} {{conclude}} my work by omitting <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the poor outside {{the walls of}} the city Canterbury. In brief, he constructed a decent and ample house of stone…for different needs and conveniences. He divided the main building into two, appointing one part for men oppressed by various kinds of infirmities and the other for women in a bad state of health. He also made arrangements for their clothing and daily food, appointing ministers and guardians to take all measures so that nothing should be lacking for them.|$|E

25|$|Although warfare took {{up most of}} King Taksin's time, he paid a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} to politics, administration, economy, and the welfare of the country. He promoted trade and fostered relations with foreign countries including China, Britain, and the Netherlands. He had roads built and canals dug. Apart from restoring and renovating temples, the king attempted to revive literature, and various branches of the arts such as drama, painting, architecture and handicrafts. He also issued regulations for the collection and arrangement of various texts to promote education and religious studies. In recognition for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the Thais, he was later awarded the title of Maharaj (The Great).|$|E
500|$|In a verse in the Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas {{alludes to}} a certain [...] "miracle at Chitrakuta", and thanks Rama for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> him at Chitrakuta. Some biographers {{conclude}} that the deed of Rama at Chitrakuta referred to by Tulsidas is the Darshan of Rama.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they were}} locally contentious, the trials boosted Seward's image across the North. He gained further {{publicity}} {{in association with}} Ohioan Salmon P. Chase when handling the unsuccessful appeal in the United States Supreme Court of John Van Zandt, an anti-slavery advocate sued by a slaveowner for assisting African Americans in escaping on the Underground Railroad. Chase was impressed with Seward, writing that the former New York governor [...] "was {{one of the very}} first public men in our country. Who but himself would have done <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the poor wretch Freeman?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008 Kasparov {{published}} a sympathetic obituary for Bobby Fischer, writing: [...] "I am often asked if I ever met or played Bobby Fischer. The answer is no, I {{never had that}} opportunity. But even though he saw me {{as a member of}} the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> our sport." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cohn aided Roger Stone in Ronald Reagan's presidential {{campaign}} in 1979–80. Cohn helped Stone arrange for John B. Anderson {{to get the}} nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, {{a move that would}} help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, dropped it off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46 percent of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, [...] "I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; why not? Father Dryfoos has {{a notion}} of paying the old fellow a {{compliment}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the country.

6000|$|... "When I {{think of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> our union!" [...] exclaimed a thick-set man, plainly a steel worker. [...] "He's just wore himself out, {{fighting}} that crooked gang." [...] He stared with sudden aggressiveness at me. [...] "Haven't I seen you some-wheres?" [...] he demanded.|$|R
2500|$|In 2017, CNN's Jake Tapper {{recapped}} President Donald Trump's berating the News media saying, [...] "instead {{of focusing}} on his accomplishments and offering an optimistic positive view of <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> <b>for</b> this country, it was an airing of grievances, it was Festivus, it was complaints about the media." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2000, Figo made a {{surprising}} and controversial $60.1million move to Barcelona's bitter rivals Real Madrid. There {{had been a}} buy out clause in his contract at Barcelona, a new world record fee, which Real Madrid met, and his arrival at Madrid signalled the beginning of Florentino Pérez's [...] "Galáctico era" [...] of global stars signed by the club every year. Figo became the new focus of the Barcelona–Real Madrid rivalry, with Barcelona fans feeling betrayed by his transfer and turned against him. His move to Madrid was significant due to {{his status as a}} star player at Barcelona, reliable and committed to the cause as a team leader. One of his Barcelona teammates stated, “Our plan was simple: give the ball to Luís. He never, ever hid.” Although now wearing the white shirt of Real Madrid, he won the Ballon d’Or award in November 2000, largely for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> Barcelona where he became the best in the world.|$|E
2500|$|When the English {{ambassador}} in Scotland, William Bowes and Willoughby discovered Ashfield's plans they organised a kidnap. John Guevara, the Deputy Warden of the East Marches and Willoughby's cousin, and three assistants {{were sent to}} Edinburgh. Willoughby later attributed the plan to his servant Waterhouse. They met Ashfield on the sands at Leith where he was riding with his Scottish friends and, it was alleged, gave him drugged wine, described as if [...] "some opium had been given him with his sugar in his wine, which so bedulled his senses as he wist not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the time." [...] Then he was driven away to Berwick in the English ambassador's coach while thinking he was getting a lift back to Edinburgh. Guevara's team were armed only with the rapiers and daggers that they normally carried. Willoughby had also organised a ship to lie off Prestonpans to give support if necessary. Ashfield's papers too were seized in Edinburgh and taken to Berwick. Willoughby wrote to Robert Cecil explaining his actions on 13 June 1599, and refused to return Ashfield to Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The context often ameliorates the {{possible}} harmful {{effects from the}} use of the is-of-identity and the is-of-predication, so {{it is not necessary to}} eliminate all such sentences. For example, [...] "George is a Judge" [...] in response to a question of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> a living would not be a questionable statement.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Hoag, a {{lover of}} art and fine dining living in Chicago, realizes {{that he has no}} memory of his daytime {{activities}} when asked, at an evening dinner, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> a living. Furthermore, when he washes his hands in the evening, he discovers a red-brown substance, possibly dried blood, under his fingernails.|$|R
50|$|Derk Dorf is {{the main}} {{character}} and the voice-over. He is playing a game of golf when, apparently, a voice over commands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>For</b> example, the voice over said for Dorf to keep his left elbow in, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> and sliced it just as the voice-over said. Apparently Dorf re-enacts whatever the Golf bible commandments are.|$|R

5000|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} called Archer. The {{name of the}} lead character was changed from Lew Archer to Harper because the producers had not bought {{the rights to the}} series, just to The Moving Target. Goldman later wrote [...] "so we needed a different name and Harper seemed OK, the guy harps on things, its essentially <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> a living." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kurt (Kurt Metzger), {{a regular}} at the bar, is an opinionated loudmouth in his thirties. He has a nihilistic world view, and {{believes}} {{it would be good}} idea to elect Donald Trump in order to destroy the current political system. It is unclear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>for</b> a living or what his source of income is. He is crude and insensitive.|$|R
60|$|We {{must assume}} that Mr. Reilly was not {{thinking}} of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> his action was contrary to all rules of gang etiquette. In the street {{it would have been}} perfectly legitimate, even praiseworthy, but in a dance-hall under the protection of a neutral power it was unpardonable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Again I bid you {{welcome to}} my home," [...] said the hermit, turning round and {{extending}} his hand, which Nigel mechanically took and pressed, but without very well knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> he was almost dumfounded by what he saw, and for some minutes gazed in silence around him.|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Clarence warmly. [...] "On the contrary, he {{was able}} to do his friends good service there, and was {{successful}} in what he attempted.
