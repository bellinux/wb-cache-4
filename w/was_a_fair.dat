5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance. As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released from the Tower of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies. He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two, the Garland and Foresight belonged to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor {{receives}} transmissions {{from the}} cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens the front door and tries to tell Marge that it was just a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> {{degree of}} {{controversy}} {{with regards to}} this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic Gastown that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.|$|E
25|$|Musashi's {{late arrival}} is controversial. Sasaki's outraged {{supporters}} {{thought it was}} dishonorable and disrespectful, while Musashi's supporters thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> way to unnerve his opponent. Another theory is that Musashi timed the hour of his arrival to match the turning of the tide. The tide carried him to the island. After his victory, Musashi immediately jumped back in his boat and his flight from Sasaki's vengeful allies was helped by the turning of the tide. Another theory states {{he waited for the}} sun to get in the right position. After he dodged a blow, Sasaki was blinded by the sun.|$|E

25|$|The 3–1 result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> {{reflection}} of an Ashes series that {{was dominated by}} the Australians. Thorpe and Atherton led the way for England's batsmen, each scoring more than 400 runs in the series, {{but the rest of}} the top order struggled, with only Hick (in six innings) and Ramprakash (in two) also averaging over 40. Gooch and Gatting both retired from International cricket at the end of the tour, and it was generally felt by commentators that it was a tour too far for both of them, as they failed regularly with the bat (they scored one fifty and one century between them in 19 innings and averaged a combined 22.47) and contributed heavily towards England's malaise in the field.|$|E
25|$|Ithilien: The easternmost {{province}} of Gondor, lying between the river Anduin and the Mountains of Shadow, subdivided by {{the stream of}} Morgulduin into North and South Ithilien. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> and prosperous land during {{the first part of}} the Third Age, filled with many woods and gardens, but after the fall of Minas Ithil the population gradually migrated across the Anduin to escape the looming threat of the Ringwraiths' city. Ithilien was reoccupied by hardy folk during the Watchful Peace, but most of them fled with the beginning of attacks by Orcs and Haradrim several centuries later, and after the return of Sauron to Mordor the land was finally abandoned. From that time, Ithilien was kept free from Sauron's servants only by the Rangers, who maintained secret refuges such as Henneth Annûn.|$|E
25|$|First {{they made}} a major four player swap with the Wichita Wings. The deal in {{principle}} was to see Drillers captain Bill Sedgewick and 'keeper Pat Onstad head to the Wings, in exchange for defender LeBaron Hollimon, and midfielder Sterling Westcott. In actuality, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> bit of underhanded dealing on both sides, as the Drillers knew that Onstad {{had no intention of}} returning to play indoor, and Wichita knew Westcott had no intention of reporting as he had agreed to a deal with a WISL club. Beyond that, Sedgewick made it clear he didn't want to play for anyone but Edmonton, and then decided to also sign with a WISL club in Utah, where he also had business interests. So, {{at the end of the}} ordeal the only player that ended up reporting was LeBaron Hollimon.|$|E

25|$|In {{agreeing to}} pay a ransom of $60,000 for the American prisoners, the Jefferson {{administration}} drew a distinction between paying tribute and paying ransom. At the time, some argued that buying sailors out of slavery <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> exchange to end the war. William Eaton, however, remained bitter {{for the rest of}} his life about the treaty, feeling that his efforts had been squandered by the American emissary from the U.S. Department of State, diplomat Tobias Lear. Eaton and others felt that the capture of Derna should have been used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of all American prisoners without having to pay ransom. Furthermore, Eaton believed the honor of the United States had been compromised when it abandoned Hamet Karamanli after promising to restore him as leader of Tripoli. Eaton's complaints generally went unheard, especially as attention turned to the strained international relations which would ultimately lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from the area in 1807 and to the War of 1812.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the season}} began in March, Hamels made a {{complaint}} about the Phillies underpaying him, {{saying it was}} a [...] "low blow" [...] and he was [...] "caught off-guard" [...] with the gap between what he and his agent John Boggs felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> reward for his performance in the previous season {{and what he was}} paid (the Phillies paid him , barely above the minimum salary for MLB players despite Hamels' strong performance).|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Arthur met {{his future}} wife, Lucille, {{in a shop}} in Alexandria. They married on 24December 1941 and honeymooned in Palestine and Syria. The sudden romance {{came as a shock}} to Arthur's parents; he later recalled, [...] "the first letter I got <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> {{imitation}} of panic I think". While on leave, he was also able to make contact with his brother Norman, who was serving as a military policeman in Beirut. Completing his tour with No.3 Squadron, Arthur was repatriated to Australia with his new bride in March 1942. Their ship journeyed to Melbourne via Bombay and Colombo, where it picked up many refugees following the recent fall of Singapore. The couple eventually had four children.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Feller {{was elected}} to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum along with Jackie Robinson. Both were the first to be elected on their first ballot {{appearance}} since the original induction class of 1936. At the time of his induction only Ty Cobb (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and Honus Wagner (95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller and Robinson's occasional dislike for each other. [...] "They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He was a good baserunner. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> hitter. He was an average second baseman. He was not as good a ballplayer as Larry Doby. There were a lot of better black ballplayers than Jackie Robinson," [...] said Feller.|$|E
500|$|In August 1981, unity {{talks between}} the three {{organizations}} appeared to have collapsed {{as a result of}} conflicting interests. Sihanouk, who feared the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, proposed that all resistance groups disarm themselves following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. Meanwhile, Son Sann demanded that the KPNLF be the lead organization within the proposed alliance, and the leaders of the Khmer Rouge [...] "most compromised" [...] by the atrocities in Kampuchea be exiled to China. Against these preconditions, Khieu Samphan reminded his rivals that the autonomy of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea should not be undermined. On 22 November 1982, Singapore, with the backing of ASEAN, proposed that three organizations form a coalition government with equal decision-making powers within the alliance. Singapore’s proposal was welcomed by Sihanouk, who believed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> deal for the non-communist movements.|$|E

500|$|The Society {{turned the}} initial {{challenge}} into {{an annual event}} titled the [...] "Halloween Challenge"; a scientific test to investigate if professional mediums could demonstrate psychic abilities in a controlled setting. In 2012, researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London conducted the challenge with two professional mediums, who both agreed beforehand that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> test of their abilities, asking them to attempt to identify information about five volunteers they had not previously met and could not see. The experiment involved the mediums writing details about the volunteers, who then had to identify themselves from the descriptions. With a success rate of one in five, the results showed little evidence of the mediums' claimed psychic ability. One of the mediums described the test as [...] "designed to confirm the researchers' preconceptions", saying {{that she had to}} work face-to-face to make a connection.|$|E
500|$|No.491 Squadron {{was formed}} in tandem with No.91 Wing on 20October 1950. Headquartered at Iwakuni, it was {{responsible}} for all maintenance of the wing's aircraft except day-to-day servicing. A section was attached to No.77 Squadron in Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance. Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section, and augmented by additional No.491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work. On one occasion, members of No.491 Squadron had to strip components from a Douglas C-47 Dakota of No.30 Communications Unit that had been destroyed when a UN Mustang smashed into its cockpit while landing at Suwon, Korea; {{according to one of}} the Australian ground crew, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> amount of urgency attached to the job as we could see Mustangs doing strafing runs not too far away." [...] Normal practice was to fly aircraft to Iwakuni for major repairs or scrapping. The regular hours worked by technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea. Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked; the commanding officer of No.77 Squadron from September 1950 to August 1951, Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell, recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands.|$|E
500|$|Despite the near-loss, Camacho said, [...] "I am {{satisfied}} with our performance. The players worked well {{and he had}} many chances to score." [...] The following Wednesday, Benfica hosted Celtic for matchday three of the Champions League. They continued struggling to convert goal opportunities, hitting the goal post twice in quick succession before finally breaking Celtic's defence with an 87th-minute winning goal by Cardozo. Camacho praised his players for not giving up and staying calm under pressure. On 28 October, Benfica hosted Marítimo for the Primeira Liga. Although Kanú scored first for Marítimo in the eighth minute, Cardozo evened the score ten minutes later. Marítimo {{had an opportunity to}} regain the lead when Quim incurred a penalty and was sent off but his replacement, Hans-Jörg Butt, stopped the penalty kick. In the second half, Adu scored the winning goal for ten-men Benfica in the 87th minute. Camacho said about teams like Marítimo, [...] "We have to change our mentality and never relax, because for teams like Marítimo or Vitória de Setúbal, their 'Champions League' is facing Benfica." [...] On the last day of October, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bonfim for their second game against Vitória de Setúbal, and the remodelled team led at half-time. During the second half Setúbal, pushing hard, scored twice to knock Benfica out of the League Cup. Camacho said, [...] "We were eliminated because they were better. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> loss." ...|$|E
