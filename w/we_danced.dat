25|$|With Traffic on hiatus due to Steve Winwood's {{struggles with}} peritonitis, Capaldi {{recorded}} a solo album Oh How <b>We</b> <b>Danced</b> in 1972. This set contained a broad variety of musical styles and featured contributions from Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, and {{several members of}} Traffic. It was well received by critics and {{proved to be a}} modest success in the USA, encouraging Capaldi to pursue a solo career alongside his work with Traffic.|$|E
25|$|Ngugi {{makes the}} {{dichotomy}} between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most {{visible in the}} speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them {{to make the trip}} to Nairobi. She says, “I think we should go. It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E
2500|$|The final great Imperial {{gathering}} at the Winter Palace was a themed fancy dress ball celebrating {{the reign of}} Alexei I, which took place on 11 and 13 February 1903 (1903 Ball in the Winter Palace). Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich recalled the occasion as [...] "the last spectacular ball {{in the history of}} the empire... a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while <b>we</b> <b>danced,</b> the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low." [...] The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I, the Empress as Maria Miloslavskaya, all dressed in rich 17th century attire, posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the Kremlin, for what was to be their final photograph together.|$|E

2500|$|The Downtown, Inc./Downtown Voice {{was another}} Downtown-related magazine. Kevin Clear of the Creneau Media Group planned to {{establish}} a magazine about Downtown Houston that would be published by Creneau. In January 1990 his company had developed a business plan aimed towards competing with Houston Downtown magazine. Houston Downtown was closed before Clear could develop a new magazine. Clear said [...] "I hate to say <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> on their grave, but we weren't unhappy {{about the way things}} turned out." [...] Clear planned to introduce his magazine in May 1991. As of January 1991 he had not decided on a name for the magazine. Elise Perachio became the editor of the magazine, which was ultimately named Downtown, Inc. On August 1, 1994, the magazine, then called Downtown Voice, was sold to company Media Ink.|$|E

60|$|We {{were all}} arrayed in our best, and our bravest; like strips of blue sky, lay the pure blue collars of our frocks upon our shoulders; and our pumps were so springy and playful, that <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> {{up and down}} as we dined.|$|E
6000|$|Last May {{we made a}} {{crown of}} flowers: we had a merry day; [...] Beneath the {{hawthorn}} on the green they made me Queen of May; [...] And <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> about the may-pole and in the hazel copse, [...] Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney-tops.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>danced</b> for an {{hour with}} great gravity, the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities, in which there {{appeared}} to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist. Caddy, while she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon him, had acquired a grace and self-possession of her own, which, united to her pretty face and figure, was uncommonly agreeable. She already relieved him of much of the instruction of these young people, and he seldom interfered except to walk his part in the figure if he had anything to do in it. He always played the tune. The affectation of the gauzy child, and her condescension to the boys, was a sight. And thus <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> an hour by the clock.|$|E

60|$|It was {{inevitable}} that we should imitate the Fire-Men in replenishing the fire. We tried it first with small pieces of wood. It was a success. The wood flamed up and crackled, and <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> and gibbered with delight. Then we began to throw on larger pieces of wood. We put on more and more, until we had a mighty fire. We dashed excitedly back and forth, dragging dead limbs and branches from out the forest. The flames soared higher and higher, and the smoke-column out-towered the trees. There was a tremendous snapping and crackling and roaring. It was the most monumental work we had ever effected with our hands, and we were proud of it. We, too, were Fire-Men, we thought, as <b>we</b> <b>danced</b> there, white gnomes in the conflagration.|$|E
