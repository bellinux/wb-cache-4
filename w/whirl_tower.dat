40|$|Elements of the SHARCS (Smart Hybrid Active Rotor Control System) Hybrid Control concept are {{demonstrated}} via {{two sets of}} <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> tests. Hybrid Control stands for combining a flow control (such as an Actively Controlled Flap or Active Twist Rotor) and of a structural (or stiffness) control device on a helicopter blade. A Hybrid Control system promises to reduce vibration and noise on helicopters simultaneously {{as well as to}} improve the efficiency of the flow control device. For the structural control system, a unique and entirely original Active Pitch Link has been developed at Carleton University, which is capable of dynamically controlling the torsional stiffness of a blade. Design, prototyping, static and <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> testing of this device is presented in the paper. A second set of <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> tests of an Active Twist Rotor equipped with a range of springs instead of the conventional pitch link, demonstrates that the Active Pitch Link shall indeed be capable of lowering the torsional stiffness of the blade. For these tests, the modal parameters of the blade were evaluated via a novel "Output-Only" method, which represents the first application of such methodology for rotary-wing applications...|$|E

During these performance measurements, acoustic data were acquired by seven microphones. A comparison of whirl-tower tests with theory indicate that theoretical prediction accuracies vary with both microphone position and the inclusion of ground reflection.

40|$|Full-scale {{tests were}} {{utilized}} {{to investigate the}} effect of the Ogee tip on helicopter rotor acoustics, performance, and loads. Two facilities were used for this study: the Langley <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> and a UH- 1 H helicopter. The test matrix for hover on the <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> involved thrust values from 0 to 44, 480 N (10, 000 lbs) at several tip Mach numbers for both standard and Ogee rotors. The full-scale testing on the UH- 1 H encompassed the major portion of the flight envelope for that aircraft. Both near-field acoustic measurements as well as far-field flyover data were obtained for both the Ogee and standard rotors. Data analysis of the whirl-tower test shows that the Ogee tip does significantly diffuse the tip vortex while providing some improvement in hover performance. Flight testing of both rotors indicates that the strong impulsive noise signature of the standard rotor can be reduced with the Ogee rotor. Forward flight performance was significantly improved with the Ogee configuration for a large number of flight conditions. Further, rotor control loads and vibrations were reduced through use of this advanced tip rotor...|$|E

60|$|The day {{following}} {{that of the}} adventure passed over without anything remarkable beyond the absence of Edgar from his usual seat {{under the shade of}} the giant oak, but the night set in stormily, dark clouds scudded before the wind, which swept up from the distant sea, and moaned around the old <b>tower,</b> <b>whirling</b> the fallen leaves in fantastic dances about the garden and the green, and shaking in its rage even the iron boughs of the oak. The household had retired early, and at eleven o'clock only Edgar and another were awake. In the student's chamber the little lamp was burning and the book lay open as usual, and Edgar pored over the pages, but at times he glanced impatiently at the quaint clock. At length, with a sigh of relief, he said, sternly and sadly, 'The time draws nigh, and once more we shall meet!' He then gathered together a few articles from different corners of the room and stepped out upon the broad landing, passed down the noble old staircase, and out from the hall. Here he was met by a cold blast of wind, which shrieked round him, as though rejoicing over its prey; and as Edgar was battling with it, a man emerged from a recess and joined him.|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{data were}} {{obtained}} for the 25 ft. diameter X-wing rotor model during performance testing of the rotor system in hover. Data collected at the outdoor <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> test facility with a twelve microphone array were taken for approximately 150 test conditions comprised of various combinations of RPM, blade pressure ratio (BPR), and blade angle of attack (collective). The three test parameters had four values of RPM from 404 to 497, twelve values of BPR from 1. 0 to 2. 1, and six values of collective from 0. 0 deg to 8. 5 deg. Fifteen to twenty seconds of acoustic data were reduced to obtain an average 1 / 3 octave band spectrum for each microphone for each test condition. The complete, as measured, 1 / 3 octave band results for all the acoustic data are listed. Another part of the X-wing noise test was the acoustic calibration of the Rye Canyon <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> bowl. Corrections were computed which, when applied to as measured data, yield estimates of the free field X-wing noise. The free field estimates provide a more realistic measure of the rotor system noise levels. Trend analysis of the three test parameters on noise level were performed...|$|E

Both models discussed in the paper are able to capture the effects of such an individual actuator control.

A comprehensive, finite element based solution for the natural vibration of the rotor blade is developed.

Linearized perturbation model of the nonlinear system are presented. The model is validated by comparing with existing <b>whirl</b> <b>tower,</b> wind tunnel and flight test results of BMR/BO- 105 helicopter.

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{research}} in the area of helicopter vibration reduction through the use of higher harmonic bade pitch control is presented. Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) is an active vibration suppression system for helicopters. Vibration is reduced through feathering of helicopter rotor blades at (b- 1) omega, bomega, and (b+ 1) omega harmonic relationships to reduce airframe vibrations at the blade passage frequency bomega where b is the number of blades and omega is the main rotor rotational speed. Research has been in the areas of blade stresses, vibrations, control systems HHC algorithms, and methods of actuation. HHC has also been reported to affect helicopter performance and main rotor noise.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a method is {{described}} for predicting the compressible, free-wake, flow about a lifting rotor-body configuration. The method {{is an extension}} of a unique vorticity embedded full-potential method used to calculate free-wake rotor hover performance. An unusual feature of this method is that it obviates the requirement for multiple grids to treat the rotor-body problem. The approach used to treat the body is similar to that used to include the rotor wake in the full potential calculation. The body is modeled as a structured circulation sheet and the strength of this sheet is determined in an iterative manner. Initially the method is tested to compute the flow past simple isolated bodies like cylinders and spheres.

40|$|Seoul National University flap(SNUF) blade is a {{small-scale}} {{rotor blade}} incorporating a small trail-ing-edge flap control surface driven by piezoelectric actuators at higher harmonics for vibration attenuation. Initially, the blade was designed using two-dimensional cross-section analysis and geo-metrically exact one-dimensional beam analysis, and its material configuration was finalized. A flap-deflection angle of Â± 4 Ë was established as {{the criterion for}} enhanced vibration reduction based on an earlier simulation.

The circulation control slot blowing produced 1 to 10 kHz broadband noise which exhibited a jet velocity to the 5. 4 dependency. Under the rotor plane loading noise was dominant, except at low values of blade pressure ratio where a sharp decrease in the blade passage frequency harmonic levels was observed. In the rotor plane, the contribution of the broadband noise sources was greater than under the rotor plane.

40|$|For {{the design}} of a {{helicopter}} rotor blade, it is crucial to predict the dynamic behavior and occurring forces and moments. For the validation of prediction tools, reliable flight test data is required. Furthermore, flight test measurements are necessary for the calculation of fatigue loads. Today, strain gauges are applied to a helicopter rotor blade to perform measurements in flight test. Locally, they allow a precise strain measurement for the complete rotor revolution. This instrumentation implies a high effort. Furthermore, wiring can imply difficulties due to its weight and its modification of the aerodynamic shape. An optical measurement technique may overcome some of the limitations of strain gauges. A precise measurement of the deformation of the complete surface of the rotor blade allows to locate high strains and to identify oscillatory modes. The exact blade position can be identified optically. One of these advanced optical measurement techniques is the Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT). Today, IPCT is a state of the art measurement technique for static and dynamic deformations. In AIM, DLR and Eurocopter explore the feasibility of Quantitative Video Technique (QVT) together with the Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT) on the rotating main rotor blades of a flying helicopter. Ground tests of the measurement system on a <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> and a tied down helicopter are performed to verify the feasibility and performance of the measurement system previous to flight testing...|$|E
40|$|To further {{improve the}} BO 105 {{helicopter}} {{mainly from the}} performance and comfort point of view, {{a new version of}} the aircraft was launched through fitting the four-bladed hingeless rotor system with advanced geometry rotor blades and installing an upgraded main gearbox. The newness of the rotor blades consists in an improved aerodynamic (airfoils, planform, twist) and structural/dynamic layout whereas the fundamental rotor characteristics like stiffness, damping, etc. remained unchanged. The new rotor blades were extensively tested in wind tunnel, on <b>whirl</b> <b>tower,</b> and in flight. The new aerodynamic blade design results in a considerable reduction of power required which is equivalent to a payload increase up to 130 kg in hover condition. The optimised blade dynamics lead in combination with reworked C. F. pendulum absorbers to an essential decrease of the cabin vibration level. The application of advanced materials and the introduction of new manufacturing procedures/processes help to improve the reliability and to reduce the costs. A survey of the rotor design rationale, the main characteristics, and the most important test results is presented concentrating upon the fields of handling qualities, vibratory loading, noise, and performance. In connection with the later one, special emphasis is laid on operational aspects including an improved Category A capability. (orig.)

40|$|The {{operational}} modal analysis, OMA, allows {{estimating the}} dynamic properties of a structure, natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes, without measuring the input forces.

The approach is based on the joint use of the statistical parameter called "entropy" and the already developed output-only procedure based on the application of the Hilbert transform properties to the output response signals. The capability to improve the OMA procedures is investigated numerically and through <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> experimental tests of a rotating blade in which both stochastic and harmonic contributions to the dynamic excitations have been provided by the perturbations arising from the operative conditions.

40|$|The non-intrusive {{in-flight}} {{measurement of}} the deformation and the resulting local pitch of an aircraft propeller or helicopter rotor blade is a demanding task. The idea of an imaging system integrated and rotating with the aircraft propeller has already been presented at the 30 th International Congress on High-Speed Imaging and Photonics (ICHSIP 30) in 2012. Since then this system has been designed, constructed and tested in the laboratory as well as in-flight on the Cobra VUT 100 of Evektor Aerotechnik, Kunovice (CZ). The major aim of the EU FP 7 project AIMÂ² (âAdvanced In-flight Measurement techniques 2 â â contract No. 266107) was to ascertain the feasibility of this technique under extreme conditions - vibration and large centrifugal forces â to real flight testing.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} to estimate the dynamic characteristics of a rotating blade using response data is proposed. A test campaign devoted to demonstrate the capability of the Smart Spring device to alter the dynamic properties of the rotating blade is {{carried out in the}} framework of the Smart Hybrid Active Rotor Control System, SHARCS, project. The key factor of this project is an active vibration control concept that uses piezoceramic actuators, Smart Spring, to preferentially vary dry friction and stiï¬ness of a structure. This device, if located at the blade root, could adaptively vary the dynamic stiffness of the blade to change its ï¬exural characteristics, thus allowing control of the aeroelastic response of the entire blade. In this paper it is shown how the modal parameters will be estimated from the time histories recorded, by a distributed array of sensors, at different rotational speeds of the blade and for different values of the stiffness of the Smart Spring device. Both time domain and frequency domain methods were applied in order to quantify the effects on the modal properties of different operating conditions of a prototype version of the Smart Spring device. This device was attached to the push rod of an Active Twist Rotor blade developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). From the performed experimental investigation, carried out at the DLRâs <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> test facility, it was possible to draw the typical fan plots of the rotating blade, from which useful information about the dynamic behavior of the system could be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Following a {{comparative}} study on shape morphing and adaptive systems to improve rotorcraft efficiency, the Green Rotorcraft consortium has selected the Gurney flap technology as demonstrator of a smart adaptive rotorblade within the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative [1]. The aim {{of such a}} system is to actively increase helicopter overall performance by improving lift and alleviating static and dynamic stall on the retreating side of the helicopter [2, 3]. The Gurney flap technology will be subjected to various tests, prior to manufacturing a full-scale demonstrator. Along with wind tunnel and <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> tests on full blade sections, a reduced-scale blade is required to be tested on a rotary support in a wind tunnel. The aim {{is to have a}} fully operational mechanism in a 1 / 8 th-scale blade. A specific system needs to be designed for this smaller model blade. The specifications for the model blade mechanism are more challenging compared to the full model blade. The blade tip speed must remain the same between the two blades. Therefore, the model blade rotation speed and centrifugal loads greatly increase. Piezoelectric patch actuators combined with flexible beams are chosen to design a fast and robust mechanism, which would fit inside the model blade and support the large centrifugal loads. A mechanism is modeled using Finite Element Analysis tools and its geometry is optimised using a surrogate optimisation to maximise displacement and force. The optimised geometry has a Z-shape profile and maximise displacement and force. The force generated is sufficient to counter directly the force of the airflow on the flap. However, the displacement and the mechanical work are not large enough to deploy directly the Gurney flap as a conventional flap. The deployment time remains insufficient as well. Building on these results, refined geometries are under investigation using the same optimisation process...|$|E
40|$|Individual Blade Control (IBC) for {{helicopter}} main rotors {{promises to}} be a method to increase flight performance and to reduce vibration and noise. Several structural concepts for the implementation of such a secondary control have been presented in the past. Many of those include discrete me-chanical components like hinges, levers or gears, which are subject to wear. In contrast to that, active twist blades use smart materials, which are directly embedded into the blade structure and â on top â do not show any discrete edges. Several different technologies have been proposed to twist rotor blades. Within the common DLR-ONERA partnership, a project called âActive Twist Bla-deâ (ATB) was established in 2004, which investigated different concepts for active twist blades, using the BO 105 blade with a cord length of 121 mm and a C-spar as reference. The concept followed by DLR uses a technology consisting of skin integrated piezoelectric patches oriented at +/- 45 deg in upper and lower skin, respectively. Specially shaped Macro Fiber Composi-te actuators (MFCs) generate a directed strain in the skin. This is a prerequisite for the shear torsi-on coupling, which causes the blade to twist. In addition to that the twist generation was enhanced by the use of non isotropy in the skin and a variation of the actuator orientation. Several different demonstrators have been designed and built, featuring different degrees of isotropy in the skin and different designs and angles of the actuator. The concept followed by ONERA uses a twistable section closed by actuation (TWISCA), where the actuator is introducing warping into the section. This is done by cutting the section along the radius of the blade and bridging this gap with a shear actuator, which is causing {{the two sides of the}} slot to move parallel to one another. Different locations of the slot in the profile were proposed. At first a slotted trailing edge was investigated, where later developments move the slot into the spar region. Specially designed shear actuators â based on MFCs as well â were laid out to intro-duce the warping movement into the structure. For both concepts several 1 : 2. 5 mach scaled demonstrator rotor blades were built which measure 2 m radius, each. Besides intensive lab tests for determining stiffness distribution and active twist for all blades a testing campaign in the DLRs <b>whirl</b> <b>tower</b> facility was carried out, which is especially equipped for testing rotor blades with active elements. The blades were tested in hover conditions, only. Blade tip twist was measured optically for all blades. The active twist angles for quasi static excitation exceeded the minimal demand of Â± 1. 5 deg for all blades. On top of that the blades dy-namic behaviour (fan plot) and active twist under centrifugal loads and quasi static and dynamic excitations were measured. The specific working capability of the designs was derived and com-pared, considering not only the twist at the blade tip, but also the torsional rigidity and the actuator volume. A final discussion of reliability and maintenance issues will close this paper. ...|$|E
