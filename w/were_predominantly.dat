5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> fishermen, {{leading to}} their villages being {{concentrated}} along river banks. However, {{with the advent}} of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment in public and private sectors. Traditionally, they are known for their silver and brass crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin and Greek among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> oral. In areas where Syriac, Coptic, Hebrew and Aramaic were spoken, they coexisted with Greek.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities {{were linked to}} the hurricane directly or indirectly, including one during evacuations. Total damage {{was estimated to be}} in excess of 5.4billion pesos (US$323.3million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5million in damage across Southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic {{population}} of Liverpool increased dramatically. About {{half a million}} Irish, who <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> Catholic, fled to England to escape the famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because {{of the increase in}} the Catholic population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (18141872), saw the need for a cathedral. The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward's College on St.Domingo Road, Everton.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} {{progress}} through four rounds {{to reach the}} final. Matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. The majority of Liverpool's ties were won by at least two goals, the exception was the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, which Liverpool won on the away goals rule. Borussia Mönchengladbach's ties <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> one-sided. The West German team won by at least four goals in all four of their ties, a 9–2 aggregate victory over Kaiserslautern represented their biggest margin of victory.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{the village}} of Borovo Selo, {{situated}} on the right bank of the Danube opposite Serbia, {{was a part of}} the Vukovar municipality. While the city of Vukovar itself had an ethnically mixed population (47.2 percent Croats and 32.2 percent Serbs), smaller settlements in the area were more homogenous. Fourteen <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> populated by Croats, ten (including Borovo Selo) by Serbs, two by Ruthenians and the remaining two were ethnically mixed.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic methods <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> used by {{physicists}} and astrophysicists.

The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> oral. In the West, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages that were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who {{described}} himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite {{in the view of}} Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E
5|$|As the {{existing}} militia forces {{were unable to}} serve overseas under {{the provisions of the}} Defence Act 1903, an all-volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914. The government pledged 20,000 men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. Enlistment and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under mobilisation plans drawn up in 1912. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the 1st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> focused upon the ground war, although small air and naval forces were also committed.|$|E

5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{first years}} as earl <b>were</b> <b>predominantly</b> {{concerned}} with the Scottish Wars. He had no personal interest in the region, but the Welsh Marches, where his landed interest lay, were largely pacified at the time, and Scotland presented {{a good opportunity to}} pursue military glory and reward. He was almost immediately trusted with important military commands on the northern border, and served as warden of Scotland from 1308 to 1309, and as captain of Scotland and the northern marches in 1309. He led an expedition to relieve the castle of Rutherglen in December 1308. The war effort, however, was not pursued with the same intensity by EdwardII as it had been by his father. The new king's neglect of the Scottish Wars allowed Robert the Bruce to regain the initiative in the war.|$|E
