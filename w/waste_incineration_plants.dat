Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma arc gasification. While older <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the Clean Air Act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste-to-energy facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent.

50|$|RE {{generation}} from waste reduced {{a little}} over the period to 792 GWh in 2014, the reduction being due to less availability of waste and the reduced proportion of waste being classified as renewable energy in 2011. Overall about 2.6% of national electricity was generated by RE generation from waste. Denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat, {{most of it is}} produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad. There are 28 <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> in the country. The waste powered CHP plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production. Only the carbon neutral biodegradable part of waste is classified as renewable energy generation which was defined as 55 percent of total waste from 2011 (in 2009 it was 58.8 percent). Total waste provided 20 percent of district heating generation and between 4 and 5 percent of electricity generation in the country. Energy production from waste {{over the next ten years}} is expected to remain at similar levels, new pre treatments of waste may however be developed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method of}} using {{incineration}} to convert {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) to energy is a relatively old method of WtE production. Incineration generally entails burning waste (residual MSW, commercial, industrial and RDF) to boil water which powers steam generators that make electric energy and heat {{to be used in}} homes, businesses, institutions and industries. One problem associated with incinerating MSW to make electrical energy is the potential for pollutants to enter the atmosphere with the flue gases from the boiler. These pollutants can be acidic and in the 1980s were reported to cause environmental damage by turning rain into acid rain. Since then, the industry has removed this problem by the use of lime scrubbers and electro-static precipitators on smokestacks. By passing the smoke through the basic lime scrubbers, any acids that might be in the smoke are neutralized which prevents the acid from reaching the atmosphere and hurting the environment. Many other devices, such as fabric filters, reactors, and catalysts destroy or capture other regulated pollutants. According to the New York Times, modern incineration plants are so clean that [...] "many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration. [...] " [...] According to the German Environmental Ministry, [...] "because of stringent regulations, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> are no longer significant in terms of emissions of dioxins, dust, and heavy metals".|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the operation of a <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> is to maximise throughput. However, increasing throughput can intensify the loading on the gas-clean-up system and also cause a violation of operational constraints.

A MOGA is ideally suited to providing decision support to a human operator because it returns a Pareto-optimal set of solutions; this allows the user to transparently assess the benefits and penalties associated with a range of candidate control decisions.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of impacts of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) on the emissions position of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> and the evaluation of useful flexible mechanisms according to the Kyoto Protocol {{with the aim of}} pushing the cost efficient reduction of greenhouse gases in those installations. The knowledge of climate affecting greenhouse gases, of energy efficiency potentials and of the relevance of different energy efficiency measures is essential for an in-depth evaluation. Therefore, a methodology for the determination of the relevance of different energy efficiency measures has been developed in connection with an evaluation of the current state of art. The methodology is based on a matrix determination. The results of Wünsch (2011), regarding specific energy efficiency measures, and their related implementation costs have been considered in order to deduce the cost efficiency of different measures, which is essential for the determination of EU ETS impacts on <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> and the realisation of projectbased mechanisms. According to this evaluation, climate affecting CO 2 emissions in the range of 6. 9 million Mg to 10. 4 million Mg are caused by the incineration processes in German <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> This means a share of 1 % of total CO 2 emissions in Germany. Most of the German wasteincineration plants are operated by strongly reduced amounts of fossil fuels as most technical configurations are based on the use of steam that is generated by the incineration process. The use of steam inside the installation boundaries results in lower energy deliveries to public districtheating systems and a reduced substitution of fossil fuels outside the installation boundaries. However, it leads to higher utilization ratios for those installations that are not connected to public district heating systems. CO 2 emissions caused by <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> mainly result from the transformation of the carbon content of wastes to carbon dioxide during the incineration process. Climate affecting CO 2 emissions from the incineration process could only be reduced by waste containing less carbon. Hence, the reduction potential of direct CO 2 emissions in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> is limited. However, there are more essential potentials regarding the energy delivery to public district heating systems or other steam/heat consuming plants and installations and, related to this, the substitution of fossil fuels. Beside the increasing connection to public district heating systems, heat recovery for drying sludge or wood could be a sensible technical concept in order to ensure efficient energy generation with those fuels with higher water content. Although a lot of technical energy efficiency measures have been conducted in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> in the past, GHG emissions could be reduced by 2. 1 to 4. 1 million Mg CO 2 e/yr according to the results of this study. Wünsch (2011) has shown a further GHG reduction potential by energy efficiency measures which were explored in his study. The energy efficiency measures considered have been categorised by their reduction potential and their need for realisation. Based on available data, the following measures show the highest potential: heat recovery from waste gases emitted to the atmosphere, increase of the energetic utilization and boiler efficiency. Continuous emissions metering systems are available on the market and can provide reliable data for CO 2 emissions. But only the total amount of CO 2 emissions can be measured. The share of climate affecting and climate neutral CO 2 emissions cannot be determined by those measurements. Hence, the evaluation of climate affecting CO 2 emissions which are relevant for an emissions trading scheme can not be conducted with reasonable costs and effort. The results of this study show significant gaps between measured, flat-rate values (50 % of total CO 2 emissions) and CO 2 emissions that are calculated by standard emission factors derived bysampling analyses. Hence, an installation specific evaluation of the biogen share of waste by regular samplings and analyses of the heating value would be necessary. Since waste is a very inhomogenous fuel, ensuring representative data through monitoring and sampling would be a very ambitious procedure. Because of the waste disposal law in Germany and the dependancy on treated waste amounts and waste compositions, positive and negative financial effects of a free allocation of certificates can occur which cannot be influenced by the operator. If free allocation shall be continued in further trading periods, a specific solution for <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> must be implemented that considers the waste disposal law. This could be managed by, for example, the allocation of certificates based on one tonne of treated waste with due regard to the waste’s composition. This would lead to specific allocation procedures for <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> implemented inthe European Monitoring and Reporting Regulation. The reduction potentials of direct CO 2 emissions in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> are limited. CO 2 emission reductions can only be realised by substituting the fossil energy used for the technical processes. Those reduction potentials are nearly exhausted in German <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> Hence, in case of including <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, operators {{may not be able to}} fulfil emission reductions as defined by the European Monitoring and Reporting Regulation. Even if the legislator created exceptions of the yearlyreduction obligations for <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> deficits of certificates could occur because of the development of waste amounts. Since no credits, that is additional certificates free of charge, can be received for the substituted energy, the current European Emissions Trading Scheme does not deal with the relevant processes in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> effectively and does not stimulate emissions reduction measures. However, credits could be generated by the project based mechanisms Joint Implementation (JI), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or similar mechanisms which are directly linked to the European Emissions Trading Scheme. If the energy efficiency of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> increases, less energy is needed for the installation itself. Hence, additional steam or electricity can be delivered to public district heating systems or the electricity grid and substitutes regularfossil generated energy. The project based mechanisms consider emission reductions caused by the substitution of fossil fuels. But new methodologies would be necessary to regulate the calculation of CO 2 emission reductions and the proof of additionality in the case of waste incineration. That means, some efforts and costs before the implementation of the project itself but does not lead to a negative assessment of those mechanisms. But even if you do not consider regular operation and maintenance costs the waste incineration process is too expensive compared to landfill gas projects. That is why those projects are widely established in the market of Kyoto mechanism while waste incineration does not play any role. Over the last three years another problem has arisen: the certificate prices. The implementation of project based mechansims and the realisation of CO 2 emission reductions measures is closely linked to the actual certificate prices. Reduction measures are going to be realised if additional credits emerge by the generated certificates considering the current fuel prices on the market and an increased energy revenue. Because of the declining certificate prices in the last three years, project based mechanisms have not stimulated efficiency measures in any kind of installation. Additionally, the continuation of those kinds of project based mechanisms is veryuncertain. Hence, there are no alternative mechanisms to stimulate efficiency measures at the moment. The evaluation of climate affecting greenhouse gases caused by <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> is still difficult since the biogenic ratio of waste can only be determined with higher effort. A reliable data base is necessary for an evaluation of the actual contribution to climate protection and efficiency potentials of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> There is further need for research. If <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> should be included in the Emissions Trading Scheme, different determination procedures could be combined. For example, the balancing method of the Technical University Vienna could be used as the main determination procedure for the biogenic carbon content of waste. Additionally, the results of the balancing method could be cross-checked by regular chemical determination procedures. With this approach the ongoing monitoring process could be reduced without impacting accuracy requirements, which should bespecifically geared to each plant. The currently established thermal waste treating procedures, in particular <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants,</b> will also rate highly in German waste management in the future. Due to the high requirements on the substitute fuels used for co-incineration in coal-fired power plants or cement works, considerable amounts of waste flow to the classic <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> Hence, the classic <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> will also be a necessary way of disposal in the future, and energy generated by the incineration process, should be used as efficiently as possible. Efficiency measures must be promoted by appropriate assistance measures because of their usually long payback period. In addition to the primarily targeting aim of waste reduction, thermal waste treatment can ensure the necessary waste disposal guarantee for amounts of waste which can not be avoided or recycled. In order to ensure a treatment of waste with the best available technique, the promotion of energy efficiency measures in the thermal waste treatment sector should be supported...|$|E
