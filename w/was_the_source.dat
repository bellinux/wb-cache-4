5|$|Even the {{earliest}} anatomists {{were able to}} recognize the cerebellum by its distinctive appearance. Aristotle and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the parencephalis, {{as opposed to the}} encephalon or brain proper. Galen's extensive description is {{the earliest}} that survives.

The Netherlands considered the Marowini (the eastern tributary river) to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of <b>the</b> Lawa; the French considered the Litani, located further to <b>the</b> west, to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of <b>the</b> Lawa.

5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938.

The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of baptismal legitimacy and authenticity.

5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History. Justin's epitomised history is also much condensed from the no-longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the history of Macedon before him, the exploits of Philip's son, Alexander the Great, and his diadochi successors during the Hellenistic period. These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond.

The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging feral population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This feral population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire in 1795. It was occupied by Germany during World War I, and declared itself independent on 16 February 1918. The next two years were marked by the turbulence of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, delaying international recognition {{and the establishment of}} political institutions. The newly formed army fought the Bolsheviks, the Bermontians, and Poland. In October 1920, Poland annexed Vilnius, the historic and modern-day capital of Lithuania, and the surrounding area; this controversial action <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of ongoing tension between the two powers during the interwar period. Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas, was designated the interim capital of the state.|$|E

5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan {{speakers}} in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its {{close proximity to}} the Mexican border, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox {{suffered}} a collapse {{late in the}} 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning.

5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity.

The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
