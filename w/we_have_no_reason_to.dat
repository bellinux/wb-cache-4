Edward Courtney notes that the prominence of Egypt in the ancient Greek novels might make it plausible for Petronius to have set an episode there, but expresses some doubt about the oracle's relevance to Encolpius's travels, [...] "since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that Encolpius reached the Danube or the far north, and we cannot suggest any reason why he should have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vikernes {{was arrested}} on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. The police found 150kg of {{explosives}} and 3,000 rounds of ammunition in his home. According to Jeffrey Kaplan in his book Encyclopedia of White Power, Vikernes [...] "intended to blow up Blitz House, the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in Oslo", a plan which [...] "was reportedly {{on the verge of}} execution." [...] In an article originally published in 1999, Kevin Coogan also mentioned Vikernes' alleged intent to [...] "destroy an Oslo-based punk anti-fascist squat called Blitz House," [...] and stated [...] "Vikernes may have felt that {{he had no choice but}} to kill Euronymous before bombing Blitz House because 'the Communist' would almost certainly have opposed such an act." [...] Vikernes denied these claims in a 2009 interview, stating [...] "I was getting [...] in order to defend Norway if we were attacked any time.

2500|$|Although most sources {{indicate}} that Chandragupta was of east-Indian origin, alternative theories {{have been proposed}} by scholars. Some relate Sandrocottos (or Androcottos) to Sisicottos of classical literature. Sisicottos was the ruler of Paropamise (Hindu Kush) who helped the last Persian satrap (Bessus of Bactria) against Alexander, later co-operating with the latter during the Sogdian campaigns. During Alexander's campaigns in Kabul and the Swat River valley, Prince Sisicottos helped him defeat several principalities of the Ashvakas. During a battle at the fortress of Aornos in which Alexander faced stiff resistance from the local population, Sisicottos was put {{in command of the}} strategically important fort and Arrian refers to Sisicottos the governor of Assakenoi. However, it is unclear whether Sisicottos was Sandrocottos or if they were related. J. W. McCrindle and H. R. Gupta hypothesize that [...] "they both possibly belonged two different branches of the Ashvakas". Meri may have been another political centre of the Mor (Meros) people. The name [...] "Moriya" [...] (or Maurya) may have come from Mor (Koh-i-Mor; [...] "Mor hill), the ancient Meros of classical literature in the Paropamisade region between the Kunar and Swat Rivers in the land of Ashvakas. (This name, [...] refers to the Meru mountain of Chitral, Tirich Mir; there is also a Deva-Meru in modern Diamar). It is claimed that since Chandragupta Maurya could have belonged to Mor, he [...] "was called Moriya or Maurya after his motherland". Spooner observes, [...] "After Alexander's death, when Chandragupta marched on Magadha, it was with largely the Persian army (Shaka-Yavana-Kamboja-Parasika-Bahlika) that he won the throne of India. The testimony of the Mudrarakshasa is explicit on this point, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt its accuracy in matter of this kind". This theory contradicts the Mudrarakshasa, which examines Malayketu's alliance with the Persians (not Chandragupta). According to the Mudrarakshasa, Malayaketu, Rakshasa (the last minister of Nanda) and his Persian allies wanted to invade Pataliputra, the capital of Chandragupta. Their alliance was undone by Chanakya, who attracted Rakshasa to the Maurya side.|$|E

5000|$|The petitioners [...] "by {{pointing}} to {{the route of the}} Fence, attempt to prove that the construction of the Fence is not motivated by security considerations, but by political ones" [...] argued that if the Fence were primarily motivated by security considerations, it would be constructed on the Green Line.

The opposite is the case: it is the security perspective - and not the political one - which must examine a route based on its security merits alone, without regard for the location of the Green Line" [...] (Article 30) and noted that [...] "The commander of the area detailed his considerations for the choice of the route. He noted the necessity that the Fence pass through territory that topographically controls its surroundings, that, in order to allow surveillance of it, its route be as flat as possible, and that a 'security zone' be established which will delay infiltration into Israel.

60|$|It {{would have}} been wiser, surely, in those Gadarenes, and better for them, had they cried--'Lord, what wilt Thou have us to do?

Tell us {{what we ought to}} do, and help us, and, if need be, compel us to do it, and so to prosper indeed.' And so should we pray in the case of this cholera. We may ask God to take it away: but we are bound to ask God also, why He has sent it. Till then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that He will take it away; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that it will be merciful in Him to take it away, till He has taught us why it was sent. This question of cholera has come now to a crisis, in which we must either learn why cholera comes, or incur, I hold, lasting disgrace and guilt. And--if I may dare to hint at the counsels of God--it seems as if the Almighty Lord had no mind to relieve us of that disgrace and guilt.|$|E
60|$|Hence {{in these}} classes, {{such as the}} Protozoa, Cœlenterata, Echinodermata, Scolecida, true {{secondary}} sexual characters do not occur; and this fact agrees {{with the belief that}} such characters in the higher classes have been acquired through sexual selection, which depends on the will, desires, and choice of either sex. Nevertheless some few apparent exceptions occur; thus, as I hear from Dr. Baird, the males of certain Entozoa, or internal parasitic worms, differ slightly in colour from the females; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that such differences have been augmented through sexual selection.|$|E
