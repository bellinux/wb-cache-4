5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its <b>weekly</b> <b>market</b> or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E
5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a <b>weekly</b> <b>market</b> and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E

5|$|However, {{he left a}} still greater {{legacy to}} the city of Glasgow. At some point between the years 1175 and 1178, Jocelin {{obtained}} from King William a grant of burghal status for the settlement of Glasgow, with a market every Thursday. The grant of a market was the first ever official grant of a <b>weekly</b> <b>market</b> to a burgh. Moreover, between 1189 and 1195, King William granted the burgh an annual fair, a fair still in existence today, increasing Glasgow's status as an important settlement. As well as new revenues for the bishop, the rights entailed by Glasgow's new burghal status and market privileges brought new people to the settlement, one of the first of whom was one Ranulf de Haddington, a former burghess of Haddington. The new settlement was laid out (probably {{under the influence of the}} burgh of Haddington) around Glasgow Cross, down the hill from the cathedral and old fort of Glasgow, but above the flood level of the River Clyde.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Bruges (1375) ensured {{peace for}} two years, but after it expired, {{fighting}} resumed between England and France. In 1377 Edward III was succeeded by Richard II. During the war, England and France struggled {{for control of}} the English Channel, with raids on both coasts. With the renewed hostilities, Parliament voted that money should be spent on defending and fortifying England's south coast, and defences were erected in Kent in anticipation of a French invasion. There was internal unrest as well as external threats, and Dalyngrigge was involved in suppressing the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The manor of Bodiam was granted a charter in 1383 permitting a <b>weekly</b> <b>market</b> and an annual fair to be held. In 1385, a fleet of 1,200 ships– variously cogs, barges, and galleys– gathered across the English Channel at Sluys, Flanders; the population of southern England {{was in a state of}} panic. Later in the year, Edward Dalyngrigge was granted a licence to fortify his manor house.|$|E

5|$|Until the Normans invaded England, the manors {{surrounding}} Altrincham were {{owned by}} the Saxon thegn Alweard; after the invasion they became the property of Hamon de Massey, though Altrincham is {{not mentioned in the}} Domesday Book. The earliest documented reference to the town is from 1290, when it was granted its charter as a Free Borough by Baron Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed a <b>weekly</b> <b>market</b> to be held, and it is possible that de Massey established the town to generate income through taxes on trade and tolls. This suggests that Altrincham may have been a planned market town, unusual during the Middle Ages, when most communities were agricultural. Altrincham was probably chosen as the site of the planned town rather than Dunham– which would have been protected by Dunham Castle– because its good access to roads was important for trade.|$|E

The largest socio-economic grouping is those working in lower-tier managerial or administrative roles (21.9%), followed by semi-routine (17.8%), routine (15%) and intermediate (12.5%) occupations; no other group comprised 10% or more. In terms of industry, the most common, based on those working in the sector, are wholesale and retail trade (including automotive repairs) at 16.9%, health and social care (13.4%), public administration and defence (13.3%) and manufacturing (10.9%), with no other groups representing 10% or more. An unemployment survey of Lincolnshire in 2014 found that the county experienced a decline in unemployment (based on Jobseekers Allowance claimants) by 29% over the preceding 12 months, while the county's unemployment rate was marginally below the national average.|$|E
