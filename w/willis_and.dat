5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works.

Its success was due to the shrewd management of <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, <b>Willis</b> <b>and</b> Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma.

While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
