25|$|Determining exactly <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> made {{exceedingly}} difficult due to extensive {{destruction of}} documents amounting to official censorship {{that began in}} the eighteenth century by church officials and even archivists. There was a general shunning of the period that lasted well into the twentieth century, and almost no pertinent documents remain in either in the major Moravian archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania or Herrnhut, Germany.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|He'd {{had some}} success, {{but then he}} {{had a series of}} setbacks. And there was also the scandal around The Warriors; any success had been eclipsed by the killings in the theaters. So there was that, as well as the noncommercial success of Southern Comfort and Long Riders and {{the fact that there was}} a writer's strike. All of that meant that Walter hadn't worked in a while. Meaning a year or so. And <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> the strike ended and the studios didn't have a lot of ready scripts. So this clever colleague, Larry Gordon, dusted off a script that had been {{shuttling}} around development and got it greenlit at Paramount with his friend Michael Eisner.

25|$|Zeno, {{as member}} of the protectores domestici, did not {{take part in the}} {{disastrous}} expedition against the Vandals, led in 468 by Leo's brother-in-law Basiliscus. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed magister militum per Thracias and led an expedition in Thrace. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of Anagastes. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for Daniel the Stylite's opinion about the campaign, and Daniel answered that Zeno would have been the target of a conspiracy but would have escaped unharmed. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by Aspar to actually capture him. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to Serdica, and because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.|$|E

500|$|The 2005 United States Grand Prix was {{run with}} only six cars, after the Michelin tyres {{used by the}} other 14 cars proved unsafe for the circuit. A {{proposal}} involving {{the addition of a}} temporary chicane to slow cars through the fastest corner of the circuit was suggested but rejected by Mosley. He stated his reasons for not agreeing to the chicane: [...] "Formula One is a dangerous activity and it would be most unwise to make fundamental changes to a circuit without following tried and tested procedures. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> bad but can be put right. This is not true of a fatality." [...] He continued, [...] "Formula One is a sport which entertains. It is not entertainment disguised as sport." [...] Mosley gave three possible solutions for the Michelin runners: to use qualifying tyres but change them whenever necessary on safety grounds, to use a different tyre to be provided by Michelin or to run at reduced speed. These were all rejected by the Michelin-shod teams. Paul Stoddart, the then-owner of the Minardi team who ran on Bridgestone tyres, was prepared to compromise to accommodate Michelin teams—even though a reduced field would guarantee his team much needed points—and was particularly vocal in his criticism and renewed his calls for Mosley to resign.|$|E
