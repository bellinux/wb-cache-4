5|$|After {{the success}} of the first Guilty Gear {{released}} on May 14, 1998 for PlayStation, Sammy Studios commissioned an arcade sequel in February 1999. Developed by Team Neo Blood, an Arc System Works production group led by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the sequel <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> years in development. Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000, Guilty Gear X was released for Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000. After the game's release, it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles. Although the developers initially indicated that Guilty Gear X would debut for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14, 2000 and re-released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> miles away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E

5|$|The commander, Bill Shepherd, was {{a former}} Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the {{beginning}} of the mission his total time in space <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> weeks. Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.|$|E
5|$|When Rand {{first arrived}} in New York as an {{immigrant}} from the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the Manhattan skyline's towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them. In 1927, Rand {{was working as a}} junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film Skyscraper. The original story by Dudley Murphy <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman's love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand's script, and the completed film followed Murphy's original idea. Rand's version contained elements she would use in The Fountainhead.|$|E

25|$|The river {{divided into}} a North Fork and a South Fork {{about three miles}} (4.8km) above its mouth. Each fork {{extended}} only one mile (1.6km) to rapids marking {{the edge of the}} Everglades. The North Fork had the greater flow and the higher drop over its rapids. One-and-one-half miles (2.4km) above the mouth of the river there was a tributary on the north side, called Wagner Creek, which <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> miles (3.2km) long. The Miami River was also fed by several springs, including some in the bed of the river. Flow was variable and in times of drought sometimes stopped completely.|$|E
25|$|At sunrise {{the nearest}} British ship <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> {{and a half}} miles behind South Carolina. Hope passed South Carolina at least once during the pursuit, even though Hope was slower before the wind. Joyner {{suggested}} that Prole tow Hope around the British and make the pursuit into a rowing match, but Prole rejected the advice. By 1300hrs the British took Hope under fire and she surrendered after having nearly collided with one of the British frigates. This just now left South Carolina, which was only a mile in front of the British ships once Hope had surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{each of the}} tribunals {{included}} two inquisitors, a calificador (qualifiers), an alguacil (bailiff), and a fiscal (prosecutor); new positions were added as the institution matured. The inquisitors were preferably jurists more than theologians; in 1608 Philip III even stipulated that all the inquisitors must have a background in law. The inquisitors did not typically remain in the position for a long time: for the Court of Valencia, for example, the average tenure in the position <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> years. Most of the inquisitors belonged to the secular clergy (priests who were not members of religious orders) and had a university education.|$|E

25|$|Gavin {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on March 22, 1907. His precise ancestry is unclear. His mother {{may have been an}} Irish immigrant, Katherine Ryan, and his father James Nally (also of Irish heritage), {{although}} official documentation lists Thomas Ryan as father; possibly {{in order to make the}} birth legitimate. The birth certificate lists his name as James Nally Ryan, although Nally was crossed out. When he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> years old, he was placed in the Convent of Mercy orphanage in Brooklyn, where he remained until he was adopted in 1909 by Martin and Mary Gavin from Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania and given the name James Maurice Gavin.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, {{along with}} 30 {{hardware}} and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network computer platform. The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the Internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became {{a partner in the}} network computing effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. Katz Media attempted to use the network computer platform concept as a way to push the Pippin into vertical markets. Although the Apple iMac (1998) is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk, the Apple Pippin platform <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> years ahead of the iMac in this effort.|$|E
25|$|If the muster-roll of Laudonnière is accurate, the {{garrison}} which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist {{an attack of}} the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> hundred and forty. Three days passed without any news of Ribault, and {{with each passing day}} Laudonnière became more anxious. Knowing the proximity of the Spaniards, and dreading a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonnière himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed.|$|E
