5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms {{part of the}} much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near {{the port city of}} Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E
5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her to meet <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> {{people who would}} help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, {{as well as the}} performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1271–1272 {{reinforcements}} arrived from Meissen, led by Count Dietrich II. The army invaded Natangia and besieged an unnamed Natangian castle. While the assault claimed 150 lives of the crusaders, most of Natangian resistance was broken and the region was decimated. Herkus Monte, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> his followers, was forced to withdraw to the forests of southern Prussia. Within a year he was finally captured and hanged. The last Prussian leader, Glappe of Warmians, was also hanged when his siege campaign on Brandenburg (now Ushakovo) was attacked from the rear. The last tribe standing were the Pogesanians, who made a surprise raid into Elbing and ambushed its garrison. In 1274 the Knights made a great expedition to avenge this raid, capturing the rebel headquarters at Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) and ending the uprising.|$|E
5|$|On Hitler's orders, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) (the {{intelligence}} {{branch of}} the SS), who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943, was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead-up to the raid. Skorzeny acted {{on behalf of the}} SD, and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito's headquarters at the cave, he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> soldiers to assassinate Tito. Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised, and had nothing further to do with the operation. It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS-Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka, the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion, who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation. Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition, the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered, which had a significant effect on the tactical planning and execution of the operation.|$|E
5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E

25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> strike leaders to hammer out an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not feel compelled to recognize the union. But the administration did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E

25|$|It was {{variously}} {{thought that}} Porteous' murder {{was carried out}} by friends of those who had been shot and killed, revenge by the smugglers, a Jacobite plot, or even a conspiracy by Presbyterian extremists. However, the organisation of events seems to imply a degree of planning, thought to be the work of James Maxwell, an Edinburgh journeyman carpenter, together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> city tradesmen and journeymen.|$|E

Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people, the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many television channels all over the world, with an accompanying English translation provided by the U.S. Defense Department.|$|E
25|$|Nor {{does the}} {{painting}} use Diana as an allegorical portrait, a tradition for which had {{developed by the}} mid-17th century, with identifiable women depicted as the goddess, {{who was also a}} symbol of chastity. An example of this tradition is Diana and Her Nymphs, painted by Jacob van Loo in Amsterdam around 1648, about seven or eight years before Vermeer's work. (Vermeer's Diana has frequently been compared to van Loo's.

25|$|Jumong {{was well}} known for his {{exceptional}} archery skills. Eventually, Geumwa's sons became jealous of him, and Jumong {{was forced to leave}} Eastern Buyeo.

Jumong eventually made it to Jolbon, where he married Soseono, daughter of its ruler. He subsequently became king himself, founding Goguryeo <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> his followers from his native country.|$|E
25|$|Unlike, for example, the Market Portal of the Mainz Cathedral, the {{identity}} of the artist responsible for the Bernward Doors is not preserved. As a result, older research attempted to identify a varying number of different artists on the basis of stylistic analysis of the individual panels. Rainer Kahsnitz has since put these attributions in doubt, since the differences in execution between the reliefs is so marginal that they might as easily be the result of technical requirements as different artistic styles. Probably a single artist was responsible for the creation of the Bernward Doors, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> apprentices and assistants.|$|E
25|$|Plans for the Portland march began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> {{women in}} Eastern Oregon on November 11, 2016, {{following}} Trump's election.

On December 27, Oregon's liaison to the national Women's March overtook the original event page. A new page was created, inviting participation {{by a group of}} women who had complained about the lack of diversity. Margaret Jacobsen became the march's lead organizer on January 6, 2017.|$|E
