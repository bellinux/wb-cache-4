25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} S(P,T) <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> a specific path in the P-T diagram: first we integrated over T at constant pressure P0, so that dP=0, {{and in the second}} integral we integrated over P at constant temperature T, so that dT=0. As the entropy is a function of state the result is independent of the path.|$|E
25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

500|$|Henrik Larsson, who {{provided}} the two assists for the goals, was delighted with the triumph and had no regrets over deciding to leave Barcelona after the match: [...] "I want to play football. I feel I haven't played as much as I would love to because of the great players we have at Barcelona". Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. <b>We</b> <b>followed</b> Liverpool's example". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating {{that he made a}} number of important saves to keep them in the match: [...] "Valdes played a decisive role. He saved us at crucial moments".|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. <b>We</b> <b>followed</b> it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Crazy Horse and I {{left the}} crowd and rode down along the river. We came to a ravine, then <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> up the gulch to {{a place in the}} rear of the {{soldiers}} that were making the stand on the hill. Crazy Horse gave his horse to me to hold along with my horse. He crawled up the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as fast as he could load his gun. They fell off their horses as fast as he could shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with singer-songwriter Phil Ochs, who {{attended}} and organized anti-war events and wrote such songs as [...] "I Ain't Marching Anymore" [...] and [...] "The War Is Over", another key historical {{figure of the}} antiwar movement was Bob Dylan. Folk and Rock were critical aspects of counterculture during the Vietnam War both were genres that Dylan would dabble in. His success in writing protest songs came from his pre-existing popularity, as he did not initially intend on doing so. Tor Egil Førland, in his article [...] "Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist", quotes Todd Gitlin, a leader of a student movement at the time, in saying [...] "Whether he liked it or not, Dylan sang for us.... <b>We</b> <b>followed</b> his career {{as if he were}} singing our songs." [...] The anthem [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] embodied Dylan's anti-war, pro-civil rights sentiment. To complement [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] Dylan's song [...] "The Times they are A-Changin'" [...] alludes to a new method of governing that is necessary and warns those who currently participate in government that the change is imminent. Dylan tells the [...] "senators and congressmen [...] please heed the call." [...] Dylan's songs were designed to awaken the public and to cause a reaction. The protestors of the Vietnam War identified their cause so closely with the artistic compositions of Dylan that Joan Baez and Judy Collins performed [...] "The Times they are A-Changin'" [...] at a march protesting the Vietnam War (1965) and also for President Johnson. While Dylan renounced the idea of subscribing to the ideals of one individual, his feelings of protest towards Vietnam were appropriated by the general movement and they [...] "awaited his gnomic yet oracular pronouncements", which provided a guiding aspect to the movement as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{moved around}} Schofield's now rapidly {{retreating}} force, Hood hoped {{to catch and}} destroy it near Spring Hill, {{to the north of}} Columbia. The 33rd Alabama and her sister regiments were moved rapidly along back-country roads and through fields and woods, with the men required to keep in ranks at all times while stragglers were dealt with severely. Forrest's cavalry arrived at the crossroads around 11:30am on November 29; they ran into elements of the Federal IV Corps, which had been rushed ahead to hold the crossing until the rest of Schofield's army could arrive. Cleburne's division arrived in the afternoon just as Forrest's men were about to exhaust their ammunition; they immediately deployed for an attack, with the 33rd Alabama crossing a small stream and advancing around 4:00pm with the rest of their division toward a Federal brigade under the command of Colonel Luther Prentice Bradley. Cleburne staggered his brigades in echelon formation, with Lowrey's Brigade on the far right. [...] Lowrey's men engaged first, with the 33rd advancing [...] "across a slope and across a field, [...] the Federals from behind some rail defenses, then on up and around... a horse lot rail fence, barn and dwelling where we were making a stand... <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> them down a slope, where we halted and reformed the line." [...] With Cleburne personally leading Govan's Arkansas Brigade in support of their Alabama comrades, his division soon routed the Federals and advanced toward Schofield's line of march on the Columbia Pike. Here they were stopped cold by Federal artillery; as darkness fell, the entire Confederate attack ground to a halt. Although Hood planned to attack Schofield's approaching army in the morning, the Federals slipped by him in the darkness as he and his men slept, moving on to the nearby town of Franklin, where the 33rd and the rest of Hood's army were about to experience their worst day of the war.|$|E
