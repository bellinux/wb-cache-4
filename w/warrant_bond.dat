40|$|The {{literature}} on wealth effects {{associated with the}} announcements of convertible-bond and warrant-bond offerings is reviewed. The findings of 35 event studies, which include 84 sub-samples and 6310 announcements, are analysed using meta-analysis. We find a mean cumulative abnormal return of − 1. 14 % for convertibles compared with − 0. 02 % for <b>warrant</b> <b>bonds,</b> the significant difference confirming a relative advantage for <b>warrant</b> <b>bonds.</b> Abnormal returns for hybrid securities issued in the USA are significantly more negative than those issued in other countries. In addition, issuing hybrid securities to refund debt {{does not seem to}} be favoured by investors.

Extending Merton [M] and Leland [L] we model securities in capital structure as derivatives on the asset {{value of the}} company and we treat all payments made to these securities as a stochastic dividend process.

50|$|Dilutive {{securities}} are {{financial instruments}} like stock options, <b>warrants,</b> convertible <b>bonds,</b> etc. {{which increases the}} number of common stock, if exercised.

40|$|Although many {{organizations}} have been born {{in the twentieth century}} and disappeared without waiting for the coming of the twenty-first, the industry known as "venture capital " will surely step forward into the new century. With some modifications, however, I predict that it will be transformed. 1. Definition of Venture Capital The term "venture capital " (abbreviated VC) is used in two ways. One is that the capital itself is provided to venture companies. One often hears it said, "Venture capital was invested in Company A. " This does not mean secured fi-nancing, but only a form of investment. The forms of venture capital invest-ment, therefore, ranges widely from common stock to <b>warranted</b> <b>bonds.</b> The other use of the term indicates a company or individual which uses the fund. The latter is very popular in Japan. In the case of emphasizing a company, the company name is added after the words "venture capital. " In America, venture capital companies have already established an industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} of this Ph. d thesis {{is focused on}} three interrelated cognitive objects of finance: the firm's capital structure, the financial innovation process and the market efficiency. Two are the basic goals of this thesis. The first one is the investigation {{and analysis of the}} main innovative financial instruments dynamically appeared in the global financial environment the last three decades. These financial products are divided into two main categories: the hybrid securities (stock, <b>warrants,</b> convertible <b>bonds,</b> innovative preferred stocks) and the innovative derivatives (credit derivatives and energy derivatives). The second goal is the Greek capital market efficiency testing relative to the announcement of convertible loans issuance and FTSE/ASE - 20 futures contracts. Two basic methodologies are applied: the event studies and the cointegration and casuality relationships. There are two main conclusions: 1) The Greek stock market is inneficient in a semi strong level and 2) The Greek organized futures market is inneficient providing opportunities for consistent profits to be made through arbitrage. ...|$|R

40|$|Option pricing {{dates back}} to {{the turn of the century}} with Bachelier's {{doctoral}} dissertation on speculation theory. In 1964 Bonness developed a formula for option pricing similar in nature to that of Black-Scholes's but that relied upon an unknown interest rate. It was not until 9 years later that Black and Scholes came up with a formula to price European options, which would revolutionize financial theory. Unlike most theoretical breakthroughs, Black-Scholes's formula became increasingly popular among practitioners, and nowadays it is widely used in the main exchanges around the world. In recent years Hull, White and Rubinstein, among many others, have worked on pricing the so-called exotic options. Meanwhile Trigeorgis, Brennan, Schwartz and others have illustrated how option theory can be used in assessing the profitability of investment opportunities(real options. Option theory has been also applied to the pricing of many other financial instruments, such as <b>warrants,</b> callable <b>bonds,</b> and callable-convertibles bonds. The aim of this paper is to discuss the progress that option theory has made since Black and Scholes developed their seminal formula. We will review the most outstanding models, mention some numerical methods used in option pricing when no analytical solution exist, and discuss the importance of real options as a new technique for assessing investment opportunities.

50|$|Most {{public offerings}} {{are in the}} primary market, that is, the issuing company itself is the offerer of {{securities}} to the public. The offered securities are then issued (allocated, allotted) to the new owners. If it is an offering of shares, {{this means that the}} company's outstanding capital grows. If it is an offering of other securities, this entails the creation or expansion of a series (of <b>bonds,</b> <b>warrants,</b> etc.). However, more rarely, public offerings take place in the secondary market. This is called a secondary market offering: existing security holders offer to sell their stake to other, new owners, through the stock exchange.
