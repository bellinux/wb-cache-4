5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three <b>would</b> <b>all</b> receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In late April, after City won 1–0 against Sheffield Wednesday {{and title}} rivals Manchester United lost to West Bromwich Albion, City {{were in a}} {{position}} where winning their final three games <b>would</b> <b>all</b> but guarantee the championship. In the first of the three, a home match against Everton, City won 2–0 in a match featuring Tony Book's first league goal for the club. Next was Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. City took a 3–0 lead before half time, eventually winning 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Instead, it was decreed that soldiers would join the legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E

5|$|A raid on Amman was {{the next}} {{operation}} for the regiment. The ANZAC Mounted Division, the 60th (London) Division and the ICCB <b>would</b> <b>all</b> take part. On 13 March the regiment started back to the Jordan Valley, through heavy rain. Orders for the raid were issued; the brigade would advance on mountain tracks via the village of Ain Es Sir, then to Amman. The rains continued postponing the raid {{and it was not}} until 01:30 on 24 March that the brigade crossed the River Jordan, by pontoon bridge at Hajlah. At 09:30 the regiment, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade started clearing the area between the river and the foothills. At 11:25 they charged and captured three artillery pieces. The brigade advance continued at 15:00, without the 6th Squadron which remained behind to assist the 181st Brigade in their assault on Es Salt. Still negotiating the mountain track, it started to rain again at 18:00 and the brigade camped for the night; starting again next morning they reached Ain Es Sir just after midday. There they were forced to stop and wait for their supplies to catch up with them.|$|E
5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience <b>would</b> <b>all</b> stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} March 2008, and later {{finished}} on August {{in the same}} year. Before principal photography commenced, director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London. In each block of episodes, {{the cast and crew}} would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once, for instance all scenes set on the Grid, although taking place in different parts of each episodes, <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be filmed together before moving on to another set. However, the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method. A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode. Because of this, the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode. To film public shots, a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by. However, by using the small crew, they and the actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public, which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas.|$|E

5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series. The winning team would be granted absolute control of running the show for a month, and the winning members <b>would</b> <b>all</b> get a week {{to be in charge of}} the program. At the November event, Team Orton defeated Team Triple H and the team were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a week.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath {{was killed}} in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it <b>would</b> <b>all</b> eventually be confiscated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} round of group matches during the 1979 Benson & Hedges Cup, a one-day cricket competition, Somerset County Cricket Club faced Worcestershire County Cricket Club at New Road, Worcester, on 24 May 1979. The result of the match would help to {{determine}} which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and Glamorgan won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be level on points, and bowling strike rate would be used as a tie-breaker. Brian Rose, Somerset's captain, realised that if he batted first and declared the innings closed after just one over, it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage and guarantee them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal deliveries.|$|E

5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{struggled}} in the 1961–62 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad {{was filled with}} journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who <b>would</b> <b>all</b> spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates {{of which would be}} Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but made sure he put in extra effort to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.|$|E
5|$|Manager Bill Nicholson and his {{assistant}} Eddie Baily then began a period of transition at White Hart Lane– key players such as Danny Blanchflower, John White and Dave Mackay <b>would</b> <b>all</b> leave the club within {{the space of a}} few years and had to be replaced. Greaves remained a consistent goalscorer though, and in the 1963–64 season he scored hat-tricks in victories over Nottingham Forest, Blackpool, Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. Spurs finished in fourth place, six points behind champions Liverpool, and exited the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup at the opening stages. Greaves scored 35 goals in 41 league games to again finish as the division's top scorer. Strike partner Bobby Smith left the club in the summer, though Greaves felt the partnership he went on to form with new signing Alan Gilzean was even more effective.|$|E

5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or they <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army {{was running out of}} food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{defeated}} Spain 3–1, {{but then}} lost 1–0 {{at home to}} Wales. This left Scotland needing to secure at least a point from their final group match, against Wales in Cardiff, {{to qualify for a}} play-off against Australia. Stein was not helped by the fact that a number of his senior players, including Graeme Souness (his captain), Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and Steve Archibald <b>would</b> <b>all</b> miss the game through injury or suspension. Stein was also taking diuretics to manage heart failure at the time but had, in the build-up to the game, decided to stop taking them to try and remained focused and negate any potential side-effects the medication might have. Despite his enthusiasm for the job and for football, the strain on Stein, combined with his poor health, had led to him indicating that he would step down after the World Cup Finals in Mexico. Scotland drew 1–1 thanks to a late penalty kick by Davie Cooper, but Stein suffered a fatal heart attack. Assistant manager Alex Ferguson took temporary charge of the team until the 1986 World Cup, from which Scotland were eliminated in the group stage.|$|E
5|$|The Roar {{missed the}} finals {{in the first}} two A-League seasons, {{finishing}} sixth in 2005–06 and fifth in 2006–07 on goal difference to Sydney FC, who finished fourth.

The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last on the ladder of 10 teams. This <b>would</b> <b>all</b> change a season later, where the Roar would do the double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping the cake with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games. The record was brought to an end by Sydney FC on a wet and windy afternoon in Sydney's west by 2 goals to nil.|$|E
