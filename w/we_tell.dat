25|$|After {{the death}} of her husband, Onassis {{returned}} permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, she attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 following the false accusation by The New York Times that she held some responsibility for the company's publication of Jeffrey Archer novel Shall <b>We</b> <b>Tell</b> the President?, which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him. Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced {{that he was going to}} challenge incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president. She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization.

500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also put him through weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and always wants to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> him to do, he actually thinks about it and asks questions. He wants to know the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history.

500|$|Show {{scriptwriter}} Mark Catley, {{who wrote}} the third standalone episode [...] "Holby Sin City", received negative criticism about the episode from fans, expressing their displeasure at the episode. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy labelled [...] "Holby Sin City" [...] as [...] "one of the show's most divisive episodes ever." [...] The show faced further criticism following the broadcast of episode forty-three, which featured a patient crash his lorry after blacking out while driving. The character was diagnosed with narcolepsy, but refused to tell the DVLA about his diagnosis. The storyline was compared to the real-life 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash, with four similarities made between the fictional crash and the real-life crash, and described as [...] "deeply unfortunate". A BBC spokesperson said, [...] "We would never knowingly imitate a real life event. Parallels can be drawn with many of our storylines. However, {{with the amount of}} stories that <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> of characters in extreme situations, it is hard to avoid dramatising situations that can occasionally be reminiscent of real life events".|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Gilligan Unbound, American {{literary}} critic Paul Cantor described how [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] references and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, {{where they have to}} re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. After Marge bails them out, Bart and Homer can speak fluent Japanese, and have fully absorbed, as Cantor writes, the [...] "exclusionary" [...] character of the Japanese culture, as Homer asks Bart (in Japanese, with English subtitles): [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> them [...] the secret to inner peace?", to which Bart replies (still in Japanese), [...] "No, they are foreign devils." [...] The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture, and is, according to Cantor, [...] "filled" [...] with signs of how eagerly Japanese have taken to American culture. In one scene, the Simpsons eat at a restaurant called Americatown, filled with US memorabilia and having only American items on the menu. Another scene shows director Woody Allen filming a commercial for Japanese television.|$|E

500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And the way <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E
