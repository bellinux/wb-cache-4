25|$|Leutschach an der Weinstraße is {{the largest}} <b>wine-growing</b> {{community}} in Styria and thus an important center of Styrian <b>wine-growing.</b> To this end, tourism, which has grown steadily in recent decades, is {{the main source of}} income for the many companies.|$|E
25|$|The Touraine <b>wine-growing</b> area {{is located}} {{at a point where}} marine and {{continental}} influences meet. A series of east-west facing valleys, where the continental influence is less harsh, present ideal conditions for the creation of microclimates that are especially favourable to <b>wine-growing.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to the {{conclusions}} of two studies published in the United States (one of which was conducted by the Colmar branch of l'INRA (Institut National de Recherche Agronomique or French National Institute for Agricultural Research) on the consequences of global warming for <b>wine-growing,</b> the Loire Valley <b>wine-growing</b> area {{should be one of}} the prime beneficiaries of the gradual increase in temperatures. Basing their calculations on Sotheby's auction statistics, these studies suggest that {{in the last ten years}} the optimum temperature for producing quality wine has already been reached in most French <b>wine-growing</b> areas, but that there is a margin for potential improvement of about 0.8°C along the banks of the Loire. If these conclusions are right, the wines of this region could, in fact, reach their peak without the need for any changes in the grape varieties grown.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wine-growing</b> area, {{which is}} located in the {{department}} of Indre-et-Loire, covers the communes of Amboise, Chargé, Mosnes, Cangey, Limeray, Pocé-sur-Cisse, Nazelles-Négron, Saint-Ouen-les-Vignes, Montreuil-en-Touraine and Saint-Règle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wine-growing</b> {{tradition}} in the region where Muscadet is produced dates from an edict of the Roman emperor Probus who had the first vineyards planted by soldiers.|$|E
25|$|A Rotling {{from the}} Baden <b>wine-growing</b> region, {{which must be}} QbA or Prädikatswein. It must be made from Grauburgunder and Spätburgunder and the {{varieties}} must be specified on the label.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{earthworks}} {{are built}} into St Michael's Hill, {{and the common}} belief {{is that these are}} the remains of an extensive motte & bailey, however a report by the Somerset County Archeologist unit suggests that these are in fact <b>wine-growing</b> terraces.|$|E
25|$|Locally-made craft {{beers and}} premium wines from various <b>wine-growing</b> area {{within the region}} are popular with {{drinkers}} and diners. Northern latitude and coastal breezes create a climate that attracts international recognition for its mostly family-owned and operated vineyards and wineries.|$|E
25|$|In the United States name {{protection}} of <b>wine-growing</b> place names {{is becoming more}} important. Several key U.S. wine regions, {{such as those in}} California (Napa, Sonoma Valley, Paso Robles), Oregon, and Walla Walla, Washington, came to consider the remaining semi-generic labels as harmful to their reputations (cf. Napa Declaration on Place).|$|E
25|$|The <b>wine-growing</b> {{area was}} first {{mentioned}} {{by the name}} Tokaj in 1067. The town itself was first mentioned in documents in 1353. Its first castle was a motte, which was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. By the 14th century the town already had a stone castle, belonging to the Diósgyőr estate.|$|E
25|$|The wide {{valley of}} the Loire {{is made up of}} a mixture of sand and silt that is carried along by the river. The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of clays and other {{elements}} that have come down from the plateau areas. The <b>wine-growing</b> area is mainly located on the two halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic puddingstone dating from the Upper Eocene Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled silex, Jurassic cherts and quartz grains. The soils of this <b>wine-growing</b> terroir can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.|$|E
25|$|Alsace {{is known}} for being the only French <b>wine-growing</b> region with a long {{practice}} in varietal labeling, which was a German tradition long before varietally labelled New world wines scored considerable export success. However, under appellation rules, not all varietal-sounding names on labels need to correspond to a single grape variety. Only one varietal label may be used on a wine, and a blend may not {{have more than one}} varietal name on the label.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century <b>wine-growing</b> became one of the mainstays of the local economy. For this reason the devastation caused by the dual scourge of mildew and {{phylloxera}} that hit the region in 1882 came as a particularly heavy blow. The extent of the damage was even greater because the wine-growers initially refused to pull up their vines, trying instead to treat them with carbon disulfide, though without success.|$|E
25|$|For {{several centuries}} Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, {{has been known}} as the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the {{presence}} of many of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul Bocuse). This reputation also {{comes from the fact that}} two of France's best known <b>wine-growing</b> regions are located near Lyon: the Beaujolais to the North, and the Côtes du Rhône to the South. Beaujolais wine is very popular in Lyon and remains the most common table wine served with local dishes.|$|E
25|$|The Wellington/Wairarapa <b>wine-growing</b> {{region is}} one of New Zealand's smallest, with several sub-regions, which include Gladstone, Martinborough, Masterton, and Opaki. Martinborough was the {{original}} area planted, {{on the basis of}} careful scientific study, in the 1970s, which identified its soils and climate as perfectly suited to the cultivation of Pinot noir. As a consequence, many of the vineyards established there are older than their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} Wairarapa. Subtle differences are seen in the wines from the South Wairarapa (which includes Martinborough), which has more maritime influences, to those grown further north.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} processes attracted many craftsman, {{merchants and}} artists with such talented ones among them as Kracker János Lukács, Anton Maulberts, Franz Sigrist, Josef Gerl, Jakab Fellner and Henrik Fasola. The town population grew suddenly. While in 1688 {{it was only}} 1200, in 1787 more than 17,000 people lived here. At this time, Eger was the 6th largest town of Hungary (based {{on the number of}} its inhabitants). Viticulture also reached its brightest period in these days. The <b>wine-growing</b> area was twelve times larger than it had been earlier.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that the Phoenicians introduced winemaking to the region several hundred years before the Romans arrived there. Recovered pieces of amphora indicate that the Phoenicians traded ancient Catalan wines with the Egyptians. The Romans had a major influence in the development of Catalan <b>wine-growing,</b> particularly around Tarragona, the Roman capital of occupied Spain. With the fall of the Roman Empire in the 4th century and subsequent Moorish rule, Catalan wine production was severely curtailed. It was several hundred years before wine production began again in earnest.|$|E
25|$|Stellenbosch {{is located}} about 50 {{kilometres}} from Cape Town and is {{situated on the}} banks of the Eersterivier ("First River") in the famous <b>wine-growing</b> region and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided between the main campus in Stellenbosch, the Tygerberg campus (where the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences is situated), the Bellville Park campus (where the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB) is situated), and the Saldanha campus (housing the Faculty of Military Science at the Military Academy of the South African National Defence Force).|$|E
25|$|The {{abundance}} of native grape varieties fostered {{an early start}} to viticulture with evidence of grape pips {{dating back to the}} Tertiary period. Archaeologists believe that these grapes were first cultivated sometime between 4000 and 3000 BC, long before the <b>wine-growing</b> culture of the Phoenicians founded the trading post of Cádiz around 1100 BC. Following the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians introduced new advances to the region-including the teachings of the early viticulturist Mago. Carthage would wage a series of wars with the emerging Roman Republic that would lead to the Roman conquest of the Spanish mainland, known as Hispania.|$|E
25|$|To {{all intents}} and purposes, the Dutch agents were middle-men, {{stocking}} and selling on French wines {{to the whole world}} and making a considerable profit in the process. Colbert (Louis XIV's finance minister) attempted to break their monopoly by creating a trading company that could deal directly with the markets. The Dutch retaliated by levying a heavy surcharge on various French manufactured articles, as well as French brandy and wine. Exports slowed down, with the regrettable result that the focus of production shifted from quality to quantity. A further undesirable effect was that cereal crops were often abandoned in favour of <b>wine-growing,</b> regardless of the land's suitability.|$|E
25|$|The Wine Country {{is an area}} of Northern California in the United States known {{worldwide}} as {{a premium}} <b>wine-growing</b> region. Viticulture and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the mid-19th century. There are over 400 wineries in the area north of San Francisco, mostly located in the area's valleys, including Napa Valley in Napa County, and the Sonoma Valley, Alexander Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Bennett Valley, and Russian River Valley in Sonoma County. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as Atlas Peak and Mount Veeder AVAs. The region is defined not only by its viticulture, but also its ecology, geology, architecture, cuisine, and culture. The majority of the grape harvest, by both area and value, derives from Sonoma County.|$|E
25|$|This is {{wine from}} one of the 13 <b>wine-growing</b> regions (Anbaugebiete), and the region must be shown on the label. It is a basic level of everyday, mostly {{inexpensive}} quaffing wines. The grapes are at a fairly low level of ripeness, with must weights of 51°Oe to 72°Oe. The alcohol content of the wine must be at least 7% by volume, and chaptalization (adding sugar to the unfermented grape juice to boost the final alcohol level, which in no way alters the sweetness) is often used. QbA range from dry to semi-sweet, and the style is often indicated on the label, along with the designation Qualitätswein and the region. Some top-level dry wines are officially QbA although they would qualify as Prädikatswein.|$|E
25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The <b>wine-growing</b> region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.|$|E
25|$|The lake's {{formerly}} {{more extensive}} lakebed creates a favorable environment for {{agriculture in the}} bordering areas of Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York. The Lake Erie sections of western New York State have a suitable climate for growing grapes, and in Chautauqua County {{there have been many}} vineyards and wineries in the area as well as in Erie County in northwestern Pennsylvania. Much grape juice is produced in this region. The Canadian region of Lake Erie's north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well; it has been dubbed the Lake Erie North Shore, or LENS region, and includes Pelee Island, and since it is farther north than comparable <b>wine-growing</b> areas in the world, the season is longer in terms of light. A longer growing season due to the lake-moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely.|$|E
25|$|The Flora of Western Australia {{comprises}} 10,162 published native {{vascular plant}} species, {{along with a}} further 1,196 species currently recognised but unpublished. They occur within 1,543 genera from 211 families; there are also 1,276 naturalised alien or invasive plant species, more commonly known as weeds. In the southwest region {{are some of the}} largest numbers of plant species for its area in the world. Specific ecoregions of Western Australia include: the sandstone gorges of The Kimberley on the northern coast and below that areas of dry grassland (Ord Victoria Plain) or semi-desert (Western Australian Mulga shrublands), with Tanami Desert inland from there. Following the coast south there is the Southwest Australia savanna and the Swan Coastal Plain around Perth, and then farther south the Warren on the southwest corner of the coast around the <b>wine-growing</b> area of Margaret River.|$|E
25|$|Hastings grew rapidly {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s (Hastings {{at this time}} was the fastest growing city in New Zealand), {{and there was a}} major issue dealing with encroachment of suburban expansion on highly productive land. Flaxmere was established as a satellite suburb to absorb rapid growth and was built upon the stony arid soils of the abandoned course of the Ngaruroro River. Although the land seemed worthless back then, it has subsequently proved highly valued for grape growing, and now is a prized region of red wine varietals in the world-famous Gimblett Gravels <b>wine-growing</b> region. Starting with economic decline nationally in the late 1970s, coupled with agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s, Hastings went into recession with more unemployment and low economic growth. It was not until the mid 1990s that the economy of Hastings began to turn around.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the {{expanding}} wine industries of California, Australia and Israel were greatly enhanced by advances in irrigation. With {{the development of}} more cost efficient and less labor-intensive ways of watering the vines, vast tracts of very sunny but dry lands were able to be converted into <b>wine-growing</b> regions. The ability to control the precise amount of water each vine received, allowed producers in these New World wine regions to develop styles of wines that could be fairly consistent each year regardless of normal vintage variation. This created a stark contrast to the Old World wine regions of Europe where vintage variation, including rainfall, had a pronounced effect on the potential wine style each year. Continuing research explored the way that controlled (or supplemental) irrigation could be used to increase potential wine quality by influencing how the grapevine responds to its environment and funnels resources into developing the sugars, acids and phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine's quality. This research lead to the development of ways to measure the amount of water retention in the soil, so that individual irrigation regimes could be plotted for each vineyard that maximized the benefits of water management.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the Washington wine {{industry}} {{can be traced to}} the introduction of Cinsault grapes by Italian immigrants to the Walla Walla region. In the 1950s and 1960s, the precursors of the state's biggest wineries (Chateau Ste Michelle and Columbia Winery) were founded. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the wine world discovered a new aspect of Washington wines with each passing decade - starting with Rieslings and Chardonnays in the 1970s, the Merlot craze of the 1980s and the emergence of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the 1990s. Washington has fourteen federally defined American Viticultural Areas with all but one located in Eastern Washington. The largest AVA is the Columbia Valley AVA, which extends into a small portion of northern Oregon and encompasses most of the other Washington AVAs. These include the Lewis-Clark AVA, the Ancient Lakes AVA, Walla Walla Valley AVA, the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, the Wahluke Slope AVA, Lake Chelan AVA, Naches Heights AVA, and the Yakima Valley AVA, which in turn also encompasses the Rattlesnake Hills AVA, Snipes Mountain AVA and the Red Mountain AVA. The Columbia Gorge AVA is west of the Columbia Valley AVA. Washington's only AVA located west of the Cascades is the Puget Sound AVA. The Ancient Lakes <b>wine-growing</b> region is the newest AVA in Washington state.|$|E
500|$|The caravan sets up camp {{outside a}} small <b>wine-growing</b> village, {{hoping to find}} {{seasonal}} work in the vineyards {{and a place to}} sell their wares. The village, as was the trend, is divided into two factions—one welcomes the Romani, and the other sees them as an intrusion. Théodore Rosier (Marc Lavoine), the village mayor and [...] veterinarian, and Mademoiselle Lundi (Marie-Josée Croze), a school teacher and clerk in city hall, are two of the friendlier villagers. The Vichy France gendarmerie used the documentation made in the passports of its citizens to monitor their movements for which a threshold was set, along with imprisonment for violations This adversely affected the Romani. Lundi uses her powers as a clerk, and forges their passports, removing the documentation about their movements.|$|E
500|$|The Rogue Valley AVA {{includes}} the drainage basin of the Rogue River and several tributaries, including the Illinois River, the Applegate River, and Bear Creek. Most wineries {{in the region}} are found along one of these three tributaries, rather than along the Rogue River itself. The region is [...] wide by [...] long (although much of the land within the AVA is not suitable for grape cultivation); there are currently 32 wineries with only [...] planted. The three valleys differ greatly in terroir, with the easternmost Bear Creek valley being warmest and driest, and the westernmost Illinois River valley being coolest and wettest. Each river valley has a unique climate and grows different varieties of grapes. Overall, however, this region is the warmest and driest of Oregon's <b>wine-growing</b> regions. The region has one sub-AVA, the Applegate Valley AVA.|$|E
