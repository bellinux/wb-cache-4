25|$|In 2001 Mayor Rudolph Giuliani {{closed the}} Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. The City {{did not have}} a {{subsequent}} plan for garbage disposal. An interim system was put in place in which most of the city's garbage was trucked out of the city to land fills in other states. This generated an unacceptable amount of truck traffic in low-income neighborhoods, leading to exacerbated air pollution. In 2006 Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation establishing a new solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plan,</b> which will use barges and trains to export 90% of the city’s 12,000 daily tons of residential trash. Under the previous scheme trucks and tractor-trailers were used for 84% of the trash. Passage of the new legislation was delayed by opponents in a Manhattan neighborhood who protested the use of a marine transfer station in the Hudson River Park. Environmentalists and social activists argued the plan promoted environmental justice because no one borough or neighborhood would bear a disproportionate burden under the proposal, and they therefore supported it.|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the raft of {{legislation}} introduced by the European Commission since the late 1980 s, <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> in the European Union (EU) is currently undergoing tumultuous restructuring. At the heart of this restructuring is the requirement by member states to formulate <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> that embrace the Commission’s central concept of the <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> hierarchy. This article begins with the assertion that the grounding of the <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> hierarchy in different European countries reflects members’ ongoing difficulties balancing supra-national environmental regulations with the imperatives of national accumulation strategies. Central to negotiating this tightrope has been a tremendous transformation, modification, re-jigging and re-calibration of the hierarchies of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> institutions in member states. The core argument advanced in this article is that far from being a neutral or technical or practical side show, contemporary (re) scalings of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> in Europe must be approached as being centrally implicated in the constitution of forms of environmental controls that serve rather than burden the interests of leading capitals. This argument is illustrated through a detailed case study of recent scalar inventions in <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> in the Republic of Ireland...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{nineteen}} seventies, the siting of {{a municipal}} solid waste facility has been the product of policy making and planning processes {{at all levels of}} government. Ideally, municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> results in a long term strategy for environmentally safe and economical waste treatment and disposal. However, public opposition often hinders the implementation of such strategies. Therefore, the issue of public opposition has to be examined in the context of municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> and implementation. Vice versa, the form and content of municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> and implementation processes shape the opposition. This study explores the history of policy making and planning for municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> in the United States. Subsequently, it examines several cases of facility siting and closing in Gloucester and Burlington Counties in New Jersey. The resulting dissertation clarifies the roles of both decision makers and takers with respect to {{municipal solid waste}} planning and implementation at the county level in New Jersey, as well as the impact of citizen activism on these processes.

40|$|Office {{building}} retrofit projects face {{many challenges}} for on-site <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> While the projects themselves {{have the potential}} for a significant level of reuse and recycling from decon-struction and demolition, their unique characteristics often prohibit direct application of existing <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> systems, which are typically based on managing waste generated through new material application in new build projects. Moreover, current <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> include no stimuli to involve Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for on-site <b>waste</b> <b>management.</b> As SMEs carry out the majority of on-site work as subcontractors, their active involvements will result in more proactive approaches to <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> and enhance project delivery. This paper discusses the interim results of a continuing research aimed at engaging SMEs in the <b>planning</b> processes of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> through the collaboration between subcontractors and main contractors of retrofitting projects. It introduces a conceptual model for SMEs to proactively plan and manage on-site waste generation for both deconstruction and construction stages, before traditional <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans</b> by the main contractor come into place. The model also suggests a collaboration process between SMEs as subcontractors and large companies as the main contractor to improve the involvement and performance of SMEs in <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> of office building retrofit projects...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning</b> {{involves}} {{selecting a}} best combination of solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> options. The deci-sion involves the perceptions and preferences of {{different groups of}} people and multiple, sometimes conflicting, project objectives that are expressed in subjective terms. As reported in this paper, these issues were addressed by developing a fuzzy multicriteria decision support system. An internet-based user-interactive decision-support application was developed based on fuzzy logic. Community specific data are stored in a centralized database and are accessible to others through a web browser. The decision support system is a tool for decision makers and environmental professionals to use in conducting local and regional integrated solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>planning.</b> A case {{study was conducted to}} illustrate the application of the models. The case study evaluated eight alternatives for managing the waste stream entering the City of Columbia Sanitary Landfill and utilized waste characterization data, other solid waste related data from the City of Columbia and the open literature, as well as preferences assigned by the researchers. The results showed that an assigned Alternative 4, which is a combination of Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and Refuse-Derived Fuel Facility (RDF) could be distinguished as the alternative that best met the established criteria. The sensitivity analysis showed that the fuzzy ranking results were not sufficiently sensitive to the different aggregation operators for combining the fuzzy importance factors. The comparison of different composition operators showed that the sum-product composition operator allows greater differentiation in the solid <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> context...|$|R

This study examines the development of Energy from Waste incineration within the waste strategies of local authorities in England. With the development of Waste Strategy 2000 for England, produced by DEFRA, (then DETR) and the inclusion of statutory recovery targets for the recovery of energy from waste, along with the implementation of the Landfill Directive (99 / 31 /EC), there created a need for introduction of EfW incineration as an alternative waste disposal option. The study looks at how local authorities are implementing EfW within their <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> and to see whether it is being developed as part of an integrated <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system. The study, based on quantitative and qualitative research methods of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> and of personal communication suggests that the development of EfW incineration is being hindered through the widespread public opposition that exists, {{as a result of the}} perception of health risks that the incineration process poses. Further more, the reluctance of local authorities to develop an integrated <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> system containing EfW incineration comprises the long-term feasibility, and sustainability of <b>waste</b> <b>management</b> within England...|$|R
