500|$|Many {{courses in}} the PGA Tour {{rotation}} (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees {{in an effort to}} reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as [...] "Tiger-Proofing". <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.|$|E

500|$|On two {{occasions}} the golfer Tiger Woods {{has been the}} target of remarks regarding fried chicken. The first occurred in 1997 when golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said that Woods should avoid choosing fried chicken for the Masters champions' dinner the following year; [...] the second when golfer Sergio García was asked in a press conference in 2013 whether he would invite Woods to dinner during the U.S. Open to settle their ongoing feud. García, a Spaniard who was unaware of the existence of this stereotype in American society, committed a gaffe saying: [...] "We will have him round every night [...] [...] [...] We will serve fried chicken", which <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate". Both Zoeller and García subsequently apologized to Woods.|$|E
500|$|After a {{slow start}} to 2014, Woods injured himself during {{the final round of}} the Honda Classic and was unable to finish the tournament. [...] He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain. [...] He {{subsequently}} competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014, and after undergoing back surgery, he announced on April 1 that he would miss the Masters {{for the first time since}} 1994. [...] Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in June, however he stated that his expectations for the week were low. [...] He would struggle with nearly every aspect of his game and miss the cut. [...] He next played at The Open Championship, contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. [...] Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and would eventually finish 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> there is currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.|$|E
500|$|In late March 2016, Woods {{announced}} that he would miss the Masters while recovering from [...] back surgery that took place on September 16, 2015. (He had also missed the 2014 Masters due to a back problem.) [...] "I'm absolutely making progress, and I'm really happy with how far I've come," [...] he explained in a statement. [...] "But I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf." [...] However, he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5, 2016. For {{the first time in his}} career he missed all four majors in one year due to problems with his back. In October 2016, he told Charlie Rose on PBS that he still wanted to break Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major titles. After 15 months out after back surgery in December 2016, Woods made his return to competitive golf in the Hero World Challenge. Woods' back problems continued to hinder him in 2017, as he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January, and pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai on February 3. On March 31, Woods announced on his website that he would not be playing in the 2017 Masters Tournament despite being cleared to play by his doctors. [...] <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> that although he was happy with his rehabilitation, he did not feel [...] "tournament ready." [...] On April 20, Woods {{announced that}} he had undergone his fourth back surgery since 2014 to alleviate back and leg pain. Recovery time required up to six months, meaning that Woods would spend the rest of the year without playing any professional golf.|$|E

500|$|With the Cardinals down by 25 {{points in}} the fourth quarter, quarterback Neil Lomax threw for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win. One of the touchdowns was to tight end Robert Awalt, the other two to league {{reception}} leader J.T. Smith. Donald Igwebuike's potential game-tying 53-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar as time ran out. The Cardinals came in on a three-game losing streak, while the Buccaneers entered the game leading the league in takeaways. The attendance of 22,449 was the Cardinals' lowest in four years, the team having announced the previous week their plans {{to move to another}} city. Detectives were assigned to guard Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill due to death threats. Irritation over DeBerg's celebrations after his three touchdown passes provided inspiration to some of the Cardinals, who commented, [...] "he's going to lose his job to Vinny Testaverde {{in a couple of weeks}} anyway". Awalt caught nine passes for 124yards, while Smith caught eight passes for 96yards. Said coach Perkins of his team's performance, [...] "...they whipped us in every phase of the game. Even down 28–3, they were playing better football than we were". After the Buccaneers turned three consecutive potential blowout wins into nail-biters, safety Rick <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> that the team seemed to be playing not to lose instead of playing to win. As an example, he noted that many players turned to see how much time was left on the clock after Cardinals linebacker Niko Noga returned a James Wilder fumble for a touchdown. The next week, Woods was demoted to the taxi squad. Offensive tackle Rob Taylor suffered a strained medial collateral ligament, and center Randy Grimes was also out for the fourth quarter with a hyperextended knee. [...] "We should have gotten a lot more hurt", Perkins said, and accused his players of allowing positive press coverage to inflate their egos and cloud their judgments. The 25-point lead, if it had held, would have represented the largest margin of victory in a Buccaneers road win. Instead, it became the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history.|$|E

He received a letter from Zuma, written in his capacity as leader of government business, saying that government saw no need for the Heath Unit to be involved. At the time, <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> there was no clarity on what it was the [...] "leader of government business" [...] was supposed to do.

2500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer months, Palmer resided in Latrobe, and he spent winters in Orlando and La Quinta, California. He first visited Orlando in 1948 during a college match. When he took up {{residence}} in Orlando, Palmer helped the city become a recreation destination, [...] "turning the entire state of Florida into a golfing paradise". That included building one of the premier events on the PGA Tour there along with his contributing to new hospitals.

[...] "The Orange County Superior Court has already thrown out the libel claim, with good reason. Today's action is merely the est people giving up on the slander cause of action," [...] said Woods. <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> that Erhard would lose his case regarding the dismissed libel charges if he attempted to bring the matter up on appeal: [...] "Saying they are going to focus on an appeal for the libel claim is only a face-saving statement." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we may need {{a little time to}} know that it is also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast."

2500|$|In 1995 T. R. Witcher of the Houston Press {{reported}} that the Third Ward, {{as defined by the}} Third Ward Redevelopment Council, [...] "may be the most variegated community in Houston."

The brick houses, south of Truxillo are larger and, in the words of Roger Wood, author of , [...] "nicer" [...] than the housing stock north of Truxillo. Throughout the history of the Third Ward, African Americans gradually occupied the brick houses.

[...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a good}} start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him.

2500|$|Historians have debated {{just why}} Johnson quit {{a few days}} after his weak showing in New Hampshire. Jeff Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the {{indicators}} turned negative he decided to leave. Lewis L. Gould maintains that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the very last minute, when {{it was too late for}} Johnson to recover. Randall Bennett <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. [...] Robert Dallek writes that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. [...] His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. [...] Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. [...] Anthony J.

2500|$|A [...] "tremendous {{amount of}} research" [...] went into recreating the servants' {{quarters}} at Ealing Studios because Highclere Castle, {{where many of}} the upstairs scenes are filmed, was not adequate for representing the [...] "downstairs" [...] life at the fictional abbey. Researchers visited nearly 40 English country houses to help inform what the kitchen should look like, and production designer Donal <b>Woods</b> <b>said</b> of the kitchen equipment that [...] "Probably about 60 to 70 per cent of the stuff in there is from that period." [...] Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management is an important guide to the food served in the series, but Highclere owner, and author of Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle, Lady Carnarvon, states that dinner parties in the era [...] "would have been even more over the top" [...] than those shown. Lady Pamela Hicks agreed, stating that [...] "it is ridiculous to think that a weekend party would consist of only fourteen house guests, it would have consisted of at least 40!" [...] However, Carnavon understood the compromises that must be made for television, and adds, [...] "It’s a fun costume drama. It’s not a social documentary. Because it’s so popular, I think some people take it as historical fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Ayiesha Woods {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} an independent album, What You Do to Me, which {{was released in}} 2004.

[...] "Crazy", a song from the album, was being played on local Christian radio where she lived in Jamaica. Gotee Records manager TobyMac was visiting the area for an interview, and heard her song on the local station Love 101. After Caribbean Hour host Arnold Kelly played a few of Woods' songs for him, TobyMac obtained her contact info and called her as soon as he returned to the United States. Initially in disbelief upon receiving the call, Ayiesha <b>Woods</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I wasn’t home when he first called ...
