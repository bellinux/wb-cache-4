5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in European history. A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.|$|E
5|$|During the {{pre-production}} {{stages of}} Entre a Mi Mundo, Selena and Pérez {{had fallen in}} love—despite their fellow band members warning them about Abraham. Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely to avoid a negative reaction from Abraham. After finding out about their relationship, Abraham fired Pérez from the group just weeks before the album was due to be released, and threatened to disband the group if Selena went after Pérez. Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Development of D {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{directed}} by WARP president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been created {{if it were not}} for playing those games. Eno and WARP were still relatively unknown in the industry, D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to Ds development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s.|$|E

25|$|The {{criterion}} of embarrassment {{is also used}} to argue in favor of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as it is a story which the early Christian Church <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> wanted to invent.

The balloon bomb was to be unmanned, and the plan was a theory which had no effective way of assuring that a bomb could be delivered and dropped remotely on the enemy. Also, as a civilian operation the Balloon Corps <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been expected to drop ordnance.|$|E

25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E

Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.|$|E

25|$|For 2014, the Lewis Conference {{was only}} able to secure one of their two {{expansion}} teams, however.

If events followed the preseason plans, these teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> matched up in an inter-conference title game. As it was, the Voyagers followed the same script as the Explorers the year before: play in the Clark Conference (on a one-year conditional basis), win the league championship, then switch conferences the very next season.

25|$|In February 1573, the Cimarrons {{informed}} Drake {{that the}} Spanish mule trains carrying the gold (also {{known as the}} flota) were sighted in Nombre de Dios and were moving across the Isthmus.

Without the help of the Cimarrons, who were clearly in charge of the path finding, Drake and his men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> made it across the Isthmus. At one point during the journey, the Cimarrons took the English to their favorite point on a steep hill where it was possible to see both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the same time.

25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E
25|$|The only {{three-dimensional}} {{depiction of}} Khufu that has survived time nearly completely {{is a small}} and well restored ivory figurine known as Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at {{the left side of}} his knees the Horus-name Medjedu is preserved, and, at the right side, the very scarce rest of the lower part of the cartouche name Khnum-Khuf is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand, and his right hand rests together with the lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a deeper level of the room rubble. Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its inventory number JE 36143. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that surely dates to the 4th dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial stylistics with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression – the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence. And Khufu himself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had a backrest that reached up to the neck of a king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the Nehenekh-flail in Khufu's left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than during the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.|$|E
