5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance {{in the name of}} Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions.

5|$|A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape.

5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while {{the women and children}} of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

5|$|Alley {{was one of}} the few {{figures who}} were trusted by {{northern}} and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty in the UK, {{and then}} by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which <b>was</b> <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
