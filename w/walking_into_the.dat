5|$|The English sailor Robert Knox {{described}} <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> island’s Tamil {{country in}} the publication An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, referencing some aspects of their royal, rural and economic life and annotating some kingdoms within it on a map in 1681CE. Upon arrival of European powers from the 17th centuryCE, the Tamils' separate nation was described in their areas of habitation in the northeast of the island.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses HΛL's remix version. The video opens with Hamasaki signing the track {{in front of an}} audience, whilst dancing around a large black platform accompanied by her background band. Several scenes portray the video being projected on a large television screen, with the ending chorus having a clone of Hamasaki <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> club and observing herself performing on stage. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle of a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds {{that he had found}} his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
60|$|The two idle {{apprentices}} found themselves, {{within a}} few hours of their escape, <b>walking</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North of England, that is to say, Thomas was lying in a meadow, looking at the railway trains as they passed over a distant viaduct--which was HIS idea of <b>walking</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North; while Francis was walking a mile due South against time--which was HIS idea of <b>walking</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North. In the meantime the day waned, and the milestones remained unconquered.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
25|$|A later installment, Dawn of the Bunny Suicides, a two-page-sequence {{shows the}} Eleventh Doctor <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS when a bunny {{jumps into the}} TARDIS doors {{at the last second}} jamming its head in between the two door, so when the TARDIS dematerializes it will decapitate him.|$|E
25|$|Rhoda Griffis portrays Kennedy in the 1992 film Love Field, set {{shortly before}} {{and in the}} {{aftermath}} of JFK's assassination. It was Griffis' feature film debut. Griffis said she had been told by her orthodontist of her resemblance to Kennedy and was cast as her upon <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> auditions for the role.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, the {{coastguard}} {{were called}} {{to a group of}} geocachers who were spotted <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Severn Estuary off the coast of Clevedon, England, in search of clues to a multi-cache. Although they felt they were safe and were able to return to land, they were considered to be in danger and were airlifted back to the shore.|$|E
25|$|Several {{members of}} the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) flew to Rome to protest saying Cardinal Law's place of honour was painful to sexual abuse victims and {{embarrassing}} to Catholics. Just as the group's members arrived at St. Peter's Basilica, led by founder Barbara Blaine, police officers escorted them outside the confines of St. Peter's Square. Blaine was unable to pass out fliers to people <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mass offered by Cardinal Law.|$|E
25|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, directed by Shūichi Banba. The video {{is composed of}} two different scenes. The first features vocalist Shiho Ochi performing the song against a sparkly stage, alongside her bandmates surrounded by mirrorballs. The second is shot outside in sepia tones, featuring Ochi walking beside {{a man in a}} white suit. The final scenes show the couple <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> club where Ochi is performing the song on stage, and they begin to dance.|$|E

25|$|Serra's {{older brother}} is the famed San Francisco trial {{attorney}} Tony Serra. They have been estranged for almost 40 years, since their mother committed suicide by <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean. Serra {{was married to}} Nancy Graves from 1965 to 1970. He then married art historian Clara Weyergraf in 1981. Since 1977, Serra and Weyergraf have resided on several floors of a former manufacturing building at 173 Duane Street in Tribeca. In 2011, the couple purchased {{the third floor of}} 173 Duane Street. Since the late 1970s, they have spent part of the year in an 18th-century farmhouse on a hill above the Northumberland Strait in Inverness County, Nova Scotia.|$|E
25|$|These events, {{along with}} the fear of atrocities stirred up by the Nazi {{propaganda}} before, caused a mass panic among the population. Many local and refugee families killed themselves together. The suicides were either performed with guns, razor blades or poison, others hanged or drowned themselves in the Peene and Tollense rivers. Several mothers killed their children before killing themselves, or walked {{into one of the}} rivers with a rock in a backpack and their babies in their arms. Some families died by <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rivers, tied together. A local forester first shot three young children, then their mothers, then his wife and then himself, surviving as a blind man. In another recorded case, a daughter cut the wrists of her parents.|$|E
25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on {{the small of his back}} and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Keith, as Claudelle Kaye, played William Powell's {{secretary}} in Manhattan Melodrama, the picture John Dillinger watched in Chicago's Biograph Theater just before <b>walking</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> FBI's fatal ambuscade in July, 1934.|$|R

50|$|One year later, a {{different}} coach {{comes to the}} orphanage. Through love and kindness, he turns the children's initial failure at tightrope <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> success. <b>The</b> film culminates with their performance on a high wire - without a safety net - {{in front of their}} entire home town.|$|R
25|$|Chen was {{reportedly}} {{shot in the}} stomach while campaigning {{in the city of}} Tainan on Friday, March 19, 2004, the day before polls opened on Saturday. According to Chen, the bullet left a flesh wound that was 11cm long and 2cm deep and was found in his clothes. He left the hospital on the same day with 14 stitches. His Vice President Annette Lu was also reportedly shot in the leg in the same incident. After the election, video from the hospital Chen and Lu were taken to showed Chen <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hospital after the Presidential Office Secretary General said that he had been taken in. The opposition made many allegations into the conduct of the security and hospital procedures requiring Chen and Lu to change parts of their stories in order for it to make sense. While many theories were put forth, the opposition had no access to the physical evidence so the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) refuted them.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{party as}} a Playboy Bunny, Elle soon realizes that she was tricked by Vivienne - the party was not a costume party. Despite this, she still courageously seeks Warner {{in an effort to}} win him back, leaving him unimpressed ("Serious (Reprise)"). Elle runs from the party, only to meet Emmett, who struggles to {{understand}} Elle's love problems. He has Elle assess her priorities until she realizes it is her obsession with Warner that keeps her from earning his respect ("Chip On My Shoulder"). Freed from her need to please Warner, she defeats him in a classroom debate. Elle then helps Paulette in a way that proves she is beginning to understand law. Warner and Vivienne win two of Callahan's coveted internship positions, and Warner proposes to Vivienne on the spot right in front of Elle. Vivienne accepts with a kiss. Before Elle's heart can break, Emmett shows her the internship list. Below the names of Vivienne, Warner, and classmate Enid Hoopes is the name Elle Woods, at which she is ecstatic ("So Much Better").|$|E
50|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot entirely in muted sepia-tone and {{featured}} DC Talk singing around three crosses in a desert, surrounded by musicians and dancers. It concludes with <b>the</b> band <b>walking</b> off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> desert sunset.|$|R

25|$|Sources {{state that}} in 626, {{the crown prince}} Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who {{supported}} Li Jiancheng, set out to ambush the rising Li Shimin. But Li Shimin heard about this trap, and organized a counter-coup, <b>walking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trap with several of his own most trusted and skilled soldiers. When Li Shimin mobilized his personal troops within his mansion, and as he did so, Princess Zhangsun {{was said to have}} personally made an appearance before the troops to encourage them. Her brother Zhangsun Wuji was one of Li Shimin's major strategists in this matter. Li Shimin was able to counter Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate and kill them, and then essentially forced Emperor Gaozu to appoint him crown prince. Princess Zhangsun was accordingly named crown princess. Two months later, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong. Princess Zhangsun, consequently, became empress, and their oldest son, Li Chengqian, became crown prince.|$|E

500|$|The threat eliminated, Quatermass quickly {{walks out}} of the Abbey, preoccupied by his thoughts. He ignores all who ask questions.
