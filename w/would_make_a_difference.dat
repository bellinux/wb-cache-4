She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E
500|$|Van Vleet {{remained}} {{loyal to}} his local Rockford Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) club team rather than accept offers to more high-profile teams in Chicago. Van Vleet {{did not feel}} it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in his recruiting: [...] "As long as you're leading whoever you're playing with, the coaches {{are going to see}} that. If they see you competing and winning with guys maybe I shouldn't be winning with, that's maybe even an advantage for me." [...] He received basketball scholarship offers from Colorado State, Northern Illinois, Southern Illinois, Drake, Detroit and Kent State. His stepfather felt that he was being overlooked by many Chicago metropolitan area schools because of his decision not to join a Chicago AAU team. He cut his list down to Kent State, Northern Illinois and Wichita State. When he accepted an offer to play for Wichita State, he became {{the only member of the}} national class of 2012 Rivals.com top 150 to attend a Missouri Valley Conference school.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E

500|$|The type of soil <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to {{the design}} of the motte, as clay soils could support a steeper motte, whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline. Where available, layers of {{different}} sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength {{to the design}}. Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength. Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive. Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, [...] "almost indestructible", they required frequent maintenance. Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them. Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.|$|E

It was moderated by Charles Collingwood. [...] Hanson Baldwin of the New York Times and former Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs (1963–64) Roger Hilsman also participated. [...] During the debate, McGee called for [...] "planned escalation;" [...] Baldwin contemplated massive bombing campaign and a naval blockade of North Vietnam. [...] It appeared that Hilsman agreed that troops should be sent, but didn't think it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> [...] McGovern was all alone in arguing against military intervention. [...] At the conclusion on the debate, Collingwood summarized that McGee was a [...] "hawk" [...] on Vietnam, McGovern a [...] "dove" [...] and Hilsman was a [...] "chicken hawk." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference,</b> Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Halfway to Sanity began in early 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, described by Rey as [...] "a dingy place in midtown." [...] For the recording process, drums, guitars, and bass were all recorded {{earlier in the}} afternoon, whereas the vocal track was always recorded {{later in the evening}} with the instrumentals already played. Rey explained that they did this because [...] "it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal, so they did." [...] Joey, however, wanted to work out [...] "how to phrase his singing" [...] and was not a fan of this method of recording. Johnny insisted that no one involved with the album would listen to Rey, not letting him make decisions that needed to made by him as the album's producer. He pointed out that Joey and Richie made it hard for the producer because they wanted to remix or change tracks. Richie, however, stated that Johnny, along with their manager Gary Kurfirst, made the album process difficult by wanting the band to spend as little money possible. He explained that he himself wanted to be more radio-friendly and promote more so they might have a hit album, but Johnny and Kurfirst didn't think it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> Richie would later recall: [...] "Why would you not want an album to be as successful as it could be? Gary Kurfirst seemed to want to keep the Ramones an underground band, I guess his thinking was, he'd profit more." ...|$|E
