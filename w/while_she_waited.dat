5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.|$|E
5|$|When Minnie {{decided to}} take up {{painting}} in 2000 <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> for her daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts. Her painting Awelye Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronometer}} {{was returned}} to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing. It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years. On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. Bolder in command of HMS Hecla. At this time Hecla was a famous ship: {{under the command of}} George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Over 6,000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> to set out on Parry's third expedition in 1824. The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship, HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage. Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole. Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of Bolder. In July 1830 the chronometer was returned from Hecla and went for cleaning to Robert Molyneux in London. It {{was returned to}} Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship.|$|E

25|$|Our Lady of Mantara in Maghdouché, Lebanon, {{also known}} in English as Our Lady of Awaiting, is a holy Christian site and a Marian shrine. The shrine {{consists}} of a tower crowned with the statue of the Virgin and Child, a cathedral, a cemetery and a sacred cave {{believed to be the}} one where the Virgin Mary rested <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> for Jesus. Ever since the rediscovery, the cave of Our Lady of Mantara has been open to the public. It has become a major pilgrimage site in the Lebanon. The adjacent hilltop where Jesus and Mary had once stood is now Sidon's Greek Catholic cemetery. Grand festivities are held each year on September 8 to commemorate the rediscovery of the sacred cave. Near the sacred cave, the people of Magdhdouché built a cathedral and a modern tower crowned with a bronze statue of the Virgin and Child. The tower offers pilgrims panoramic views of Sidon, the Mediterranean, and the lush hills, valleys and citrus groves of South Lebanon.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of her debut single [...] "Locomotion" [...] in Australia, Minogue {{traveled}} to London to work with Stock Aitken Waterman, a successful British writing and production team. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] in forty minutes <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> outside the recording studio. Mike Stock wrote the lyrics for the song in response {{to what he had}} learned about Minogue prior to her arrival. He believed that although she was a successful soap star in Australia, attractive and very talented, there had to be something wrong with her and figured that she must be unlucky in love. Minogue recorded the song in less than an hour, which Stock attributes to her good ear for music and her quick memorization skills. After Minogue finished the recording session she returned home to Australia to continue work on the soap opera, Neighbours. After hearing the song, Waterman said [...] "I thought it was fantastic, so I ran over to the DJ and asked him what it was. He said 'Its Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky'." [...] He later said to Mike Stock that the song would be an instant smash hit.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, {{during a}} Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert, the other cast members of Neighbours {{put on their}} own talent stage show. Minogue had not {{prepared}} anything so she got up on stage and performed a cover version of [...] "Loco-Motion" [...] - she was then immediately signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records. The song was released as a single in Australia, and became the highest-selling single of the 1980s. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with Stock, Aitken and Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> outside the studio. Minogue recorded the song {{in less than an}} hour, and returned home to Australia to work on Neighbours. The song became a huge chart success, and Mike Stock travelled to Melbourne to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session. [...] While Stock was there, Kylie recorded her next single, [...] "Got to Be Certain" [...] along with album track, and the Japan-only single release, [...] "Turn It into Love", and Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album.|$|E

500|$|During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit {{concert with}} other Neighbours cast members, Minogue {{performed}} [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] as {{a duet with}} actor John Waters, and [...] "The Loco-Motion" [...] as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987.

The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a [...] "Special Achievement Award". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, [...] "The Locomotion", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart.

Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song [...] "Especially for You", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as [...] "the Singing Budgie" [...] by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as [...] "standard, late-80s ... bubblegum", but added, [...] "her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable".|$|E

2500|$|Meeting {{with each}} of the other five {{possible}} suspects, Poirot notes that none of the quintet has an obvious motive, but finds that their views have subtle differences in regards to the original case. Although Phillip is overtly hostile towards Caroline, Meredith mistrusts his brother's view and is more sympathetic in his opinion of her. Elsa, meanwhile, was left prematurely devoid of emotion after her original passion for Amyas, except for an overall hatred of Caroline, while Cecilia, who gives her insight on both her and her sister Angela, claims she has a definite reason for believing that Caroline was guilty of the murder. Finally, Angela believes that her sister is also innocent, though unlike Carla, she receives a letter from her that contains no protestation of innocence, which raises doubts for Poirot. Considering the accounts of all five suspects carefully, Poirot is able to establish the succession of events {{on the day of the}} murder, and notes that there are four small facts that are important to solving the puzzle - the degree of circumstantial evidence incriminating Angela; Caroline's frantic effort to wipe the fingerprints off the bottle of beer <b>while</b> <b>she</b> <b>waited</b> by Amyas' dead body, as witnessed by Cecilia; the conversation overheard between Caroline and Amyas, over the latter offering to oversee the packing of Angela's things for her return to school; and the heated argument overheard by Elsa between Caroline and Amyas, in which he swore he would divorce his wife, and Caroline had bitterly said [...] "you and your women." ...|$|E
