25|$|On February 23, 1883, William Kinsman {{had been}} living with May Woodman. Apparently as a joke, someone had run a notice in the Epitaph {{newspaper}} that Kinsman intended to marry Woodman. Kinsman responded and ran his own announcement {{that he had no}} intentions of marrying May Woodman. Kinsman <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Oriental Saloon on Allen Street when May Woodman walked up and shot him. Woodman was sentenced to five years in the Yuma Territorial Prison for killing Kinsman, although the acting governor pardoned her after she had served less than one year.|$|E
25|$|James King, {{a popular}} {{journalist}} and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch {{the formation of}} a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856. Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held. The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands. King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, {{but by the time the}} funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes. Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a surrounding wall to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags. During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey there was not a single murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies. In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.|$|E
500|$|The crowd {{continued}} to press around the soldiers, taunting them by yelling, [...] "Fire!", by spitting at and throwing snowballs {{and other small}} objects at them. Richard Palmes, a local innkeeper who was carrying a cudgel, came up to Preston and asked if the soldiers' weapons were loaded. Preston assured him they were, but {{that they would not}} fire unless he ordered it, and (according to his own deposition) that he was unlikely to do so, since he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket. He recovered his weapon, and was thought to angrily shout [...] "Damn you, fire!", then discharged it into the crowd although no command was given. Palmes swung his cudgel first at Montgomery, hitting his arm, and then at Preston. He narrowly missed Preston's head, striking him on the arm instead.|$|E

2500|$|King {{signed the}} band to his UK Records label in July 1972 and dubbed them 10cc. By his own account, King chose the name {{after having a}} dream in which he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the {{boarding}} read [...] "10cc The Best Band in the World". A widely repeated claim, disputed by King and Godley, but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Creme, and also on the webpage of Gouldman's current line-up, is that the band name represented a volume of semen {{that was more than}} the average amount ejaculated by men, thus emphasising their potency or prowess.|$|E
2500|$|Healy's friend, {{the writer}} Henry Taylor, told Moe Howard that {{the fight was}} preceded by an {{argument}} between Healy and three men whom he identified as [...] "college fellows". The younger men allegedly knocked Healy {{to the ground and}} kicked him in the head, ribs and abdomen. [...] The wrestler Man Mountain Dean reported that he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Plaza Hotel in Hollywood at 2:30am when Healy emerged, bleeding, from a taxi. [...] He related an [...] "incoherent story" [...] of being attacked at the Trocadero, but could not identify his assailant. [...] Dean contacted a physician, Sydney Weinberg, who treated Healy at the hotel. [...] Another friend, Joe Frisco, then drove him to his home. [...] Wyantt LaMont, Healy's personal physician, was summoned to the home the following morning when Healy began experiencing convulsions. [...] Despite the efforts of LaMont and a cardiologist, John Ruddock, Healy died later that day. [...] Because of the circumstances, LaMont refused to sign Healy's death certificate.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 21 November 1971, {{when the}} natural climate {{was dry and}} more {{adaptable}} and by which time the Bangladesh Forces had severely weakened {{the strength of the}} West Pakistan Forces through its guerilla operations, under a complicated politico-military scenario. India-Pakistan war of 1971 breaks out and Indian troops enter Bangladesh allied with Mukti Bahini. The Pakistani force were demoralized from constant attacks by the Mukti Bahini, on 16 December 1971 the Pakistani Military force in Bangladesh surrender to a joint force of Indian and Bangladesh forces. Group Captain A. K. Khandker represented the Bangladeshi side at the signing of the surrender treaty. K M Shafiullah, S Force commander, and a handful of others were also among the hundreds of local masses who surrounded the event from a distance. [...] "No protocol was set on what they were supposed to do". A fact Shafiullah admitted himself. [...] "We rushed to the Race Course from the airport. I was a member of Bangladesh delegation. But we were not sure what we were supposed to do. I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the signing table. That's why I do not appear in any photographs.

2500|$|In 1996 Coppola {{was charged}} in the 1977 killing of John [...] "Johnny Cokes" [...] Lardiere. According to authorities, Lardiere was {{released}} for 26 hours from prison to spend the Easter holidays with his family. The reason for his sanctioned killing aren't fully known, but is speculated that he had turned against the mob {{and was going to}} give the FBI information on the mob's influence on garbage hauling. Another story has it that Lardiere got into a heated argument with Ralph [...] "Blackie" [...] Napoli, a caporegime in the Philadelphia crime family and his death was ordered. When Lardiere got out of his car at a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel, Coppola <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him with a [...]22 automatic pistol, complete with a silencer. When Coppola squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed. Lardiere was both amused and annoyed by the man and allegedly said [...] "What're you gonna do now, tough guy?". Coppola responded by pulling up his pant leg, and removing a [...]38 revolver from an ankle holster and shooting Lardiere four times. When police arrived at the crime scene, they knew immediately it was a mob hit. The shooter had left behind his weapons and a hat. In 1996 Lucchese crime family mobster Thomas [...] "Tommy" [...] Ricciardi who had been arrested on murder and extortion charges, decided to cooperate with authorities. He told the FBI that Lardiere's killer was Michael Coppola. Ricciardi told police that he heard the entire story of Lardiere's murder from Coppola while talking about mob murders with Michael Taccetta at a party in 1983.|$|E
