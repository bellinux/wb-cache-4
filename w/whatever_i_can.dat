500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
2500|$|Insofar as {{they are}} the subject of pure mathematics, I now know at least that they can exist, because I grasp them clearly and distinctly. For God can {{undoubtedly}} make <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> grasp in this way, and I never judge that something is impossible for Him to make unless there would be a contradiction in my grasping the thing distinctly.

2500|$|In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes {{embarked}} upon a quest {{in which}} he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, {{in order to find}} out of what he could be certain. In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a [...] "thinking thing" [...] (...) , and an immaterial substance. This [...] "thing" [...] was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, [...] "the thing that exists" [...] (...) , regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in Meditation VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. <b>Whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.|$|E

2500|$|After he {{took his}} oath of office he was {{surrounded}} by the foreign press, intrigued in part by the oath controversy, who [...] "had to be ushered out of his office after {{he took his}} oath to make room for home-state news crews." [...] Ellison has been [...] "featured {{in a series of articles}} written for foreign dissemination by the Department's Bureau of International Information Programs." [...] Including an article that was translated into Persian and Arabic that [...] "highlighted the diversity of his constituents in Minnesota, ranging from Swedes and Norwegians to 'the largest Somali immigrant community in America.'" [...] In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the U.S., saying things like [...] "religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately." [...] Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying [...] "he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'" [...] Ellison staffers told reporters that [...] "the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war." [...] When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said [...] "Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to make some friends for America." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
