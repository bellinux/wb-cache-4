Cope's rival Othniel Charles Marsh also collected some bones of Dimetrodon, which he sent to the Walker Museum.

However, he ran afoul of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913.|$|E

5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, {{and those who were}} open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E

Minogue won four Logie Awards for her portrayal of Charlene, including the Gold Logie, becoming the youngest person to do so. Critical reaction to the character has been positive.

40|$|A {{major issue}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> {{translation}} {{is the problem}} of stylistics. Literary works and their specific style can, and often do, pose a problem <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> translation, as a novel’s specific stylistic characteristics can be difficult to recreate in a target language. Portnoy’s Complaint, written by critically acclaimed author Philip Roth, is no exception <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> stylistic problems (1969). This thesis explores different aspects of Portnoy's Complaint with their regard to translation problems; style and stylistics, Judaism, culture specific items, and coarse langauge and taboo...|$|R

5|$|Emperors of the {{proceeding}} Song dynasty (960–1279) {{tended to}} marry from {{within their own}} borders. Tang emperors, mainly took their wives from high-ranking bureaucratic families, but the Song dynasty did not consider rank important <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> selecting their consorts. It {{has been estimated that}} only a quarter of Song consorts were from such families, with the rest being from lower status backgrounds. For example, Liu, consort of Emperor Zhenzong, had been a street performer and consort Miao, wife of Emperor Renzong was the daughter of his own wet nurse.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
