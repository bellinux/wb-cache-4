5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players.

Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>arrive</b> at the mansion.|$|E
