500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller {{considered}} Uru a major {{departure from}} Myst and Riven in that Cyan {{wanted to create}} a persistent world, where actions occurred while the player was not online. Miller did not consider the game a true massively multiplayer online game, saying [...] "there is not leveling and skills and monsters and experience in any artificial sense. The 'leveling' is finding and exploring and owning new Ages that are released regularly; the experience is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> learn while exploring that will help you later—not points on a scale." [...] Miller considered there to be two benefits to such a system: firstly that players would care more about being part of the story, and secondly that even new players could make discoveries and be part of the community. The game was designed as more of a spin-off than a sequel to previous Myst games, due to the merging of items from the contemporary (traffic cones and T-shirts) to the fantastic (books that transport the user to new worlds).|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Gittings and Kameny {{organized}} {{a discussion with}} the American Psychiatric Association entitled [...] "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, [...] "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> need is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country." [...] A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed {{to appear on the}} panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself [...] "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was [...] John E. Fryer, and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as [...] "transformative".|$|E

What you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|MG Siegler of TechCrunch {{said that}} the {{difference}} between Lion and Mountain Lion was not comparable to the difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard because Mountain Lion adds many new features that were not available in Lion. He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when Mountain Lion hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to know is whether Mountain Lion is worth the upgrade. Let's get that out of the way now — yes, it is definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, Mountain Lion was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E

2500|$|The writer {{changed the}} fate of another character, Krug's son Justin {{attempting}} to give the audience a better [...] "sense of hope". Craven points out that early on he suggested that Krug have a son who commits suicide, but found it interesting to see [...] "this strange Romeo and Juliet thing happening" [...] between Krug's son and Mari. He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real." [...] Ellsworth {{wanted to create a}} level of interest in the characters that would [...] "engage [...] ", as opposed to simply leaving the family in [...] "even worse shape [...] the end of the movie". He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that the point is to show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways". Iliadis expressed {{that he did not want}} to go the way of [...] "torture porn", which is what he sees most horror films moving toward, but instead show a sense of [...] "urgency" [...] with the parents' actions.|$|E
