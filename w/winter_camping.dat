25|$|The {{primary program}} was {{wilderness}} canoe trips, through the {{lakes and rivers}} of northern Wisconsin and {{the southern edge of}} the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The base provided training, outfitting, and guiding for these trips as well as sleeping and meal facilities for groups of 6-12 crew members, including an adult leader, as they prepared to start or end canoe trips. They also provided transportation to and from starting and ending points. Training included an intensive Voyageur course for the youth leader of a group during the week prior to the group's trip. Additional programs for Scouts included whitewater trips on the lower Flambeau Flowage, swimming at the White Sand Lake beach, informal sandlot football and softball games between staff members and Scouts at the base, and <b>winter</b> <b>camping</b> in the cabins left by the CCC.|$|E

When a U.S. post office was established on the site on June 15, 1870, the name was changed to the English [...] "Grand Forks".

[...] The newly formed Boy Scout Council, the George Rogers Clark Council (formed by Scouts of Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Scott, and Washington counties) was seeking an area for a camp. [...] In 1917 local Troop 3 had used the Work {{property}} as a summer camp, and used it for three straight summers. [...] On April 2, 1928, Murphy sold the property to the Scouts. [...] Organizations around the area pitched in to improve the property, allowing the camp to open in 1929. [...] A series of three-sided pioneer-style cabins were built near the cemetery in 1933. [...] In 1942 the Scoutmaster's Cabin and Evergreen cabins were completed. [...] In 1950 the McDonald Bridge was completed across Fourteen Mile Creek. [...] The camp saw its greatest use in the 1950s and 1960s, with 564 scouts the highest attendance ever (1960). [...] In 1969 the property's swimming pool was built, as the creek was no longer safe to swim in.In the 1980s The Works Home was renovated by the Camp Ranger Jeff Streets, who then moved into the Works home after completion. Since 1993 the property has seen less use, as George Rogers Clark Council merged with another council, and the rough terrain protects it from development. [...] Since the merger, the camp has been used primarily by Cub Scouts and for <b>winter</b> <b>camping.</b>|$|E

60|$|Three main {{regions and}} three main kinds of {{wandering}} and imperfectly settled people {{there were in}} those remote days of the first civilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt. Away in the forests of Europe were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly race. The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before 1500 B.C. Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various Mongolian tribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the horse and developing a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between their summer and <b>winter</b> <b>camping</b> places. Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish peoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of Russia and the greater Caspian Sea of that time. For very much of Russia there was swamp and lake. In the deserts, which were growing more arid now, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people, the Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses from pasture to pasture. It was these Semitic shepherds and certain more negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the first nomads to come into close contact with the early civilizations. They came {90} as traders and as raiders. Finally there arose leaders among them with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors.|$|E
