40|$|As more {{advanced}} theoretical methods become available for {{solution of the}} complex <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> (CPT) boundary-value problem, {{it is essential to}} develop methods to validate those solutions experimentally. A large scale model penetrometer testing facility, consisting of a half-circular calibration chamber with digital image correlation (DIC) capability, was developed for experimental simulation of <b>cone</b> <b>penetration.</b> The flat side of the chamber is transparent, made of Plexiglass. In individual tests, sand samples are prepared inside the half-circular chamber by pluviation; the half-circular cone is then pushed into the sand model flush against the Plexiglas, with the penetration process digitally imaged for DIC analysis. The displacement data obtained from DIC analysis provided valuable insights into the <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> boundary-value problem. Experiments with three different types of silica sands show that sand crushability influences the slip pattern around the advancing cone and also the <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance. The derived strain paths show that very complex modes of deformation are experienced by the soil elements in close proximity of the penetrometer tip. The close-up imagery of the interface zone provided useful information for understanding the model penetrometer-sand interface behavior. The series of <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> tests conducted in layered sand profiles show that the sensing and development depths are dependent upon the position of weak and strong layers with respect to the direction of the advancing cone.

The CPT is also performed in unsaturated soils yet very {{little is known about}} how to interpret the recovered results. The few published studies on the CPT in unsaturated soils have focused on either clean sands or a silt. Never before have the effects of hydraulic hysteresis and suction hardening, features known to influence the mechanical behavior of many unsaturated soils, on <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance been investigated. This research aims to fill these knowledge gaps. The soil considered in the study is a silty sand, a soil for which hydraulic hysteresis and suction hardening are present. A theoretical component includes a new cavity expansion analysis. This is useful since the pressure required to expand a cavity has a relationship with the <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance. The effects of where the initial hydraulic state is located on the soil-water characteristic curve is investigated and found to have a significant influence on cavity pressure. Also, the effects of three different drainage conditions on cavity pressure are studied. It is found that the condition in which the contribution of suction to the effective stress is constant offers a good approximation to the others. One experimental component includes soil element tests to obtain the constitutive properties of the silty sand. Test results were used to calibrate a bounding surface plasticity model and generate cavity expansion results. Another experimental component includes laboratory-controlled CPTs in silty sand samples. Suction is observed to have a pronounced affect on <b>cone</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance. A new fractal-based hydraulic conductivity model is developed to study the time needed to achieve suction equilibrium in the samples during set up.
