5|$|Scotch Run flows over Leck Kill soil, a {{deep and}} well-drained fine loamy soil for its entire length. However, the {{northern}} and southern edges of the watershed are on Hazleton soil, a deep, loamy, siliceous, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Successful birch {{cultivation}} {{requires a}} climate cool enough {{for at least}} the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. They grow best in full sun planted in deep, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} soil {{associations}} in Juniata County. One {{of these is}} the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association. It is a deep and fairly <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> that is found in 24% of the county. It is mostly found in the county's forested areas. The Berks-Weikert-Bedington Association is also found in the county. It is found in 33% of the county's area and is not as deep as the Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association, but is well-drained. The soil is mostly found in agricultural lands and some forested areas. Another soil association in the county is the Edon-Opequon-Weikert Association, which is a <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> that occupies 17% of the county. The Elliber-Kreamer-Mertz Association is a deep and <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> that makes up 12% of the county. The Chenango-Pope-Holly Association and the Morrison-Hazelton-Clymer Association make up 7% and 6% of the county, respectively. They are both deep and occur on gentle slopes. However, the former is poorly drained, while the latter is well-drained. The Hazelton-Laidig-Buchanan Association is well-drained and makes up 1% of the county's area.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b> The species {{is more likely to be}} found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil,</b> and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The Pseudonarcissus {{group in}} their natural habitat prefer humid {{situations}} such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It grows best in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> but can {{tolerate}} some clay or limestone.|$|R
50|$|It grows at altitudes up to 2,900 m on <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils,</b> {{avoiding}} waterlogged ground.|$|R
50|$|It may {{be short}} lived in cultivation, but tends to last longest in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
5|$|A fast-growing and {{attractive}} plant, Banksia speciosa grows readily {{in a sunny}} location in dry climates on <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil,</b> but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia serrata and B.integrifolia to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1830. Banksia speciosa is an important cut flower crop. It {{was one of several}} species considered for commercial cropping in Tenerife, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately tolerant to salinity.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> in areas with dry summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E
50|$|But it will {{grown in}} <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> in any sunny spot {{that are not}} too wind-swept.|$|R
50|$|Astroloma pinifolium can {{be grown}} in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> or in {{containers}} in part shade, and propagated from cuttings.|$|R
50|$|It can be {{cultivated}} in an alpine house or outside in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> {{similar to other}} Juno irises.|$|R
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri. Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. Widely {{considered one of the most}} attractive Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, B.coccinea grows well in a sunny location on <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil,</b> but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.|$|E
50|$|It is hardy {{in places}} {{with a dry}} summer and full sun. It prefers to grow in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been {{successfully}} grown in the southern parts of Australia in sunny positions in light, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{grows in}} moist but <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils,</b> mostly sandy soils over sandstone; its habitat is {{generally}} amongst shrubby eucalypt woodland.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Jiaogulan is a vine hardy to USDA zone 8 {{in which}} it may grow as a short lived {{perennial}} plant. It can be grown as an annual in most temperate climates, in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> with full sun. It does not grow well in cold climates with temperatures below freezing.|$|E
25|$|Diospyros virginiana grows through , in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b> In summer, {{this species}} {{produces}} fragrant flowers which are dioecious, so one must have {{both male and}} female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are parthenocarpic (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The flowers are pollinated by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.|$|E
50|$|Lodoicea inhabit rainforests {{where there}} are deep, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> and open exposed slopes; {{although}} growth is reduced on such eroded soils.|$|R
50|$|It is most {{abundant}} {{in the shade of}} deciduous trees on moist but <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils</b> with pH of 6.7 to 7.4.|$|R
50|$|The {{palm tree}} is endemic to Colombia. It {{is found in}} the Pacific {{lowlands}} of the country, occurring on <b>well-drained</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
25|$|Parsley grows best in moist, <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil,</b> {{with full}} sun. It grows best between , and usually is grown from seed. Germination is slow, taking {{four to six}} weeks, and it often is {{difficult}} because of furanocoumarins in its seed coat. Typically, plants grown for the leaf crop are spaced 10cm apart, while those grown as a root crop are spaced 20cm apart {{to allow for the}} root development.|$|E
25|$|The seeds {{should be}} sown {{early in the}} spring time. Put the {{seedlings}} into separate pots, and it is recommended to let them winter in the greenhouse for their first winter season. To clean them rub the capsules through a screen. It's advised to plant them in the late spring or early summer because division {{takes place in the}} spring. They should be grown in <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil</b> with full sun. The climate can be cool.|$|E
25|$|Pinyon-juniper {{woodlands}} {{occur in}} areas {{with a wide range}} of soils, with parent materials composed of limestone, lava, and sandstone. Soil textures range from coarse, rocky gravels to fine, compacted clays. Ponderosa pine forests in the western United States occur on igneous and sedimentary parent materials including basalt, volcanic cinder, limestone, and sandstone. Conifer seeds are buried by pinyon jays in areas sparsely covered with vegetation, with patches of bare soil and rocks, indicating <b>well-drained</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
