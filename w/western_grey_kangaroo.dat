5|$|The concept plan {{identified}} 145 {{species of}} birds as either known or expected {{to be found in}} the park. By 2006, 98 species had been recorded in the park's area, though not all specifically within the park's boundaries. Of the park's insects, seven species were found to be largely confined by its boundaries, with little presence in the rest of Adelaide. Their presence was unusual, as they were regarded as arid zone species. Approximately 35 reptile and amphibian species have been recorded within Anstey Hill park. Fauna in the park includes <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, short-beaked echidna, Gould's wattled bat, chocolate wattled bat, little forest bat, white-striped free-tailed bat and the lesser long-eared bat. Koalas are present, though they are not native to the area, having been deliberately introduced to the Adelaide hills.|$|E
25|$|The <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> (Macropus fuliginosus) is {{slightly}} smaller again at about 54kg (119lb) {{for a large}} male. It {{is found in the}} southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin. The highest population densities occur in the western Riverina district of New South Wales and in western areas of the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia. Populations may have declined, particularly in agricultural areas. The species has a high tolerance to the plant toxin sodium fluoroacetate, which indicates a possible origin from the south-west region of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Southern hairy-nosed wombats, {{along with}} other wombat species, select native {{perennial}} grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available. Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is Stipa nitida, which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes. This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass. The teeth of the wombat are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts. The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less than other herbivorous mammals. As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.|$|E
50|$|Fauna {{found in}} the {{conservation}} park includes <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> and short-beaked echidnas.|$|R

40|$|Density {{distributions}} {{of red and}} <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> in the South Australian pastoral zone were determined for the period 1978 - 86. The habitat associations of these kangaroos were analysed using the densities on half-degree blocks, and information on landform and soil type, land use and degradation, vegetation, and climate. Red kangaroos were found throughout the pastoral zone, the highest densities being in the north-east. <b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> were restricted to the southern parts of the pastoral zone. Higher densities of red kangaroos were associated with pastoral land use, with brown calcareous and red duplex soils, and with areas dominated by low bluebush shrublands. They were not particularly closely associated with areas dominated by mulga. Habitat associations of red kangaroos were different in drought years compared to non-drought years. Changes in density distribution during drought {{appear to have been}} due to the patchiness of rainfall. The relative effect of the drought was greatest {{in the northern part of}} the pastoral zone. Outside this effect, recent rainfall was found to be of only secondary importance to the overall density distribution of red kangaroos. Climatic factors appeared to be the major determinants of the density distribution of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos.</b> Low evaporation and relatively high rainfall characterised areas with high densities of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos.</b> As was the case with red kangaroos, habitat heterogeneity appeared to be an important requirement of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos.</b> Also, habitat associations were different in drought and non-drought years. Despite this, as was the case with red kangaroos, recent rainfall was only of secondary importance to the overall distribution of <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{kangaroo}} is a marsupial {{from the}} family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning [...] "large foot"). In common use the term is {{used to describe the}} largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus: the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 March 1802, British {{explorer}} Matthew Flinders, commanding HMS Investigator, {{named the}} land [...] "Kanguroo (sic) Island", {{due to the}} endemic subspecies of the <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus, after landing near Kangaroo Head on the north coast of the Dudley Peninsula. He was closely followed by the French explorer Commander Nicolas Baudin, {{who was the first}} European to circumnavigate the Island and who mapped much of the island (which is why so many areas have French names).|$|E

40|$|Densities {{of red and}} <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> and euros were {{assessed}} by aerial survey and compared with densities obtained {{in the same area}} by drive counts. The survey area (12. 1 km 2) was long, narrow and sparsely vegetated. Lakes and a kangaroo-proof fence bounded the area on three sides facilitating the drive count. Densities from aerial surveys ranged between 38 and 54 % of the corresponding drive counts for red kangaroos, between 15 and 23 % for <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> and between 9 and 10 % for euros. The time of morning at which the surveys were conducted altered these percentages. About twice as many red and <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> were counted on aerial surveys at sunrise compared to surveys 3. 5 h later...|$|R

50|$|<b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>{{kangaroo}}</b> {{is closely}} related to eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus), and their distribution overlaps extensively, especially in the Murray-Darling basin. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although hybridisation occurs in both directions in the overlap zone between the two species in the wild, this {{does not seem to be}} the case with captive animals. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo.</b> This is an example of unidirectional hybridisation.|$|E
50|$|The park also {{supports}} {{an array of}} mammals including short-beaked echidna, the western quoll, Gilbert’s dunnart, the honey possum, the <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo,</b> the western brush wallaby, Gould’s wattled bat and Mitchell’s hopping mouse.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to distinguish from its sibling species, the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus). However, the <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroo</b> has darker grey-brown fur, darker colouration around the head, and sometimes has a blackish patch around the elbow.|$|E
40|$|<b>Western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> (Macropus fuliginosus melanops) are large, foregut fermenting herbivores {{common to}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{southern}} woodlands and shrublands, but they extend well into semiarid habitats at the north-eastern {{edge of their}} range. At this range boundary, <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> occupy open chenopod (saltbush) shrubland, along with Australia 2 ̆ 7 s other large native kangaroos, {{as well as with}} extensive pastoral stock, primarily the wool-breed merino sheep. In this habitat, within a large naturally vegetated enclosure (16 ha), <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> grazing sympatrically with merino sheep spent much of the day resting under shade trees, and fed mainly during the evening and early morning, mainly on grasses and flat-leaved chenopods. On this diet, <b>western</b> <b>grey</b> <b>kangaroos</b> had water turnovers similar to those of red kangaroos, at 1. 1 L d− 1. Sheep, however, used 7. 7 L of water each day. Thus, although the sheep were twice the average body mass of kangaroos, the sheep used more than seven times as much water. This level of water use by sheep was almost half that previously reported for sheep at the same site feeding mainly on salt-laden chenopods (ca. 12 L d− 1), but was consistent with other studies showing lower water usage by sheep feeding on trees and low-salt shrubs; foregut (rumen) contents of our sheep comprised 35...|$|R
