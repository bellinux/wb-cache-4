This volume ratio had to be main-tained for 24 hr. Stibine is not available commer-cially because it is unstable; consequently, a method was sought which would supply the gas in the de-sired concentration throughout he test period. A survey of available literature indicated that no reported methods would meet this requirement. Electrolytic methods for generation of stibine using antimony electrodes have been previously reported (1, 2). These methods proved unsuitable because the production of stibine was either too low or too irregular. I t was found that if the antimony electrode were replaced by a 40 gauge, platinum-iridium electrode (90 : 10) in conjunction with an antimony sohition, stibine output at the cathode was fairly uniform and of the desired order of magnitude.

One concern {{is the issue of}} statistical power. A number of <b>WET</b> <b>tests</b> may pass the current hypothesis test approach because they lack statistical power to detect relevant toxic effects because of large within-test variability. Additionally, a number of <b>WET</b> <b>tests</b> may fail the current approach because they possess excessive statistical power, as a result of small within-test variability, and detect small differences that may not be biologically relevant. The strengths and limitations of both the traditional hypothesis test approach and the bioequivalence approach for use in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program were evaluated. Data from 5, 213 single-concentration, short-term chronic <b>WET</b> <b>tests</b> with Ceriodopknia dubio provided the database for analysis.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent changes}} {{in the field of}} aquatic toxicity/Whole Effluent Toxicity (<b>WET)</b> <b>testing.</b> There are been numerous legal challenges to the validity of <b>WET</b> <b>testing,</b> both at the federal and state levels, but to date, the regulators have prevailed and <b>WET</b> <b>testing</b> is used as a regulatory tool to ensure that the biota of receiving streams are protected. The most recent ruling at the federal level was on December 10, 2004, when a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia upheld the validity of <b>WET</b> <b>testing.</b> At the state level, at the urging of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, the state legislature passed a law (the South Carolina Aquatic Life Protection Act) in 2004 that requires the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the <b>WET</b> <b>test.</b> As a result, SCDHEC removed <b>WET</b> <b>test</b> limits from several NPDES permits. EPA took issue with the impact of the legislation and SCDHEC's actions, and as a result, EPA has taken over several NPDES permits from SCDHEC and threatened to revoke the state's delegated NPDES permit program. A new Act was signed into law in March 2005, which does not exclude the use of chronic toxicity testing for regulatory compliance. As a result, EPA has turned over the issuance of NPDES permits back to SCDHEC. In December 2004, the U. S. EPA issued the Draft National WET Implementation Guidance document for review and comment. The guidance contains recommendations on the determination of ''reasonable potential'' for toxicity. The EPA's ECOTOX database is a valuable resource of toxicity data for many chemicals. For those cases in which there are no toxicity data or very limited data available, the EPA has developed two models, the Interspecies Correlation Estimation (ICE) and the Acute to Chronic Estimation (ACE), for predicting toxicity. Active areas of research include assessing the uptake of heavy metals via multiple routes of exposure, the development of risk-based criteria for persistent bioaccumulative toxicants, and the new field of computational toxicology, which utilizes modeling tools to predict toxic responses...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{study of}} {{aldehydes}} in diesel exhaust {{is important because}} of their relationship to diesel odor, to air pollution, and {{to the development of}} a theory of combustion. Therefore, a study is made of the low order aliphatic aldehydes using gas chromatography in conjunction with standard <b>wet</b> chemical <b>tests.</b> The engine is a two stroke-cycle GMC 3 - 71 RC diesel, with standard injectors, connected to an eddy current dynomometer. A special ten foot insulated exhaust pipe is used for the sample collection. Engine load and exhaust pipe length are used as variables, two probes 6. 7 feet apart being sampled simultaneously. For the gas chromatographic analysis the aldehydes are converted to 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives in special tall form bubblers. The precipitates are then volumetrically dissolved in carbon disulfide in preparation for the chromatographic separation. The columns are ten percent SF 96 on 60 - 80 mesh acid washed DMCS treated Chromosorb W in 6 feet by 0. 085 inch I. D. stainless steel. Nitrogen at 60 ml per minute is used as the carrier gas and the hydrogen flow for the flame ionization detector is 35 ml per minute. The column temperature is 230 °C and the injector temperature 270 °C. The sample injection size is 10 μ. The chromotropic acid test is used as a <b>wet</b> <b>test</b> for the formaldehyde concentration in the exhaust, the MBTH test being used for total aliphatic aldehydes. The <b>wet</b> <b>tests</b> are used for correlation studies with the gas chromatograph and for comparison with literature values. No correlation was found between the chromatograph and <b>wet</b> <b>tests,</b> the <b>wet</b> <b>tests</b> usually giving higher values.

The average molecular weight of the lower molecular weight aldehydes in the diesel exhaust is found by gas chromatographic analysis to be approximately 35, 75 - 80 mole percent of the total aldehydes being formaldehyde.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{instrument}} specifications {{given in}} current international (ISO) and national (ASAE) standards state that measured values should be within 90 % {{of the true}} amplitude of vacuum change at the various locations in the milking machine. Recommendations are given for the minimum sampling rate and response rate of instruments used to measure vacuum changes for dry, wet, milking–time, and cleaning–time tests. These minimum performance requirements should ensure that the measurement accuracy stated in the ISO and ASAE standards are met. A simple method was developed to measure the response rate of a vacuum recording system. The method can be used, quickly and easily, by field or laboratory technicians to specify the response rate of their vacuum recording systems. The predominant effects on response rate of vacuum recording systems are caused by the fittings connecting the electronic vacuum recorder to the measurement point.

40|$|Engineered {{barriers}} of two designs are being tested at the Engineered Barriers Test Facility (EBTF) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. This report describes the test facility, barrier designs, and instruments {{used to monitor}} the <b>test</b> plots. <b>Wetting</b> <b>tests</b> conducted on the test plots in FY- 97 are described and data collected from monitoring the test plots before, {{during and after the}} <b>wetting</b> <b>tests</b> are used to evaluate the performance of the covers during FY- 97 and FY- 98. Replicates of two engineered barrier designs were constructed in the EBTF cells. The first design comprises a thick, vegetated soil cover. The second design incorporates a capillary/biobarrier within the vegtated soil cover. The capillary barrier uses the textural break between an upper, fine textured soil and a lower, coarser-textured gravel layer to inhibit drainage under unsaturated conditions while increasing soil moisture storage in the root zone. Evaporation and transpiration by plants (although the test plots have not yet been vegetated) are used to recycle water stored in the soil back to the atmosphere. A geotextile fabric is used to maintain separation of the soil and gravel layers. A thick layer of cobbles beneath the gravel layer serves as a biobarrier to prevent intrusion of plant roots and burrowing animals into underlying waste (there is no waste in the test plots). Each test plot was instrumented with time domain reflectometry probes and neutron probe access tubes to measure moisture contents, tensiometers, heat dissipation sensors, and thermocouple psychrometers to measure matric potentials, thermocouples to measure soil temperature, and ion-exchange resin beads to monitor tracer movement. Each drainage sump is equipped with a tipping bucket instrument and pressure transducer to measure drainage. Precipitation is measured using a heated rain gauge located at the EBTF. Instrument calibration equation coefficients are presented, and data reduction techniques are described. The <b>wetting</b> <b>tests</b> were designed to stress the test plots to the maximum by forcing drainage to occur. Drainage generally occurred two to three days following the start of the <b>wetting</b> <b>test.</b> Drainage from the capillary/biobarrier test plots stopped sooner than drainage from the thick soil test plots. Similar results were observed in drainage data collected in FY- 98 following the spring thaw. Drainage from the capillary/biobarrier test plots following the winter of 1998 represents about one-third of the precipitation occurring during that period compared to two-thirds of the precipitation from the thick soil test plots. By limiting drainage, the capillary/biobarriers increased water storage in the upper portions of the test plots compared to the thick soil barriers. The data evaluated in this report come from an ongoing project. The aftereffects of the <b>wetting</b> <b>tests</b> continue to be monitored.

40|$|Textile {{plants are}} {{important}} sources of toxic discharges in the receiving ecosystems. Their effluents may contain or-ganic and inorganic substances that are potentially toxic to aquatic biota, and their identification involves expensive and complex analytical techniques (Gómez et al. 2001). In complex effluents, {{like those of}} textile industry, interac-tions among several pollutants might be synergistic, an-tagonistic, or simply additive. Consequently, complex mixtures {{can be considered as}} non-toxic when some sub-stances are investigated individually but toxic when those mixtures are analysed. Many toxicological investigations involve the study of a single pollutant, which may give a clearer picture of toxicological effects than studies of com-plex chemical matrix such as textile effluents. However, in natural ecosystems, the biota is usually exposed to a com-plex and unknown combination of several pollutants (Abel 1998). Therefore, whole effluent toxicity (<b>WET)</b> <b>tests</b> can be more realistic than the study of individual pollutants (Juvonen et al. 2000, Mitchell et al. 2002, Araújo et al. 2005) and are recognized as practical and effective tools for the assessment of combined effects of toxic substances on aquatic ecosystems (Gómez et al. 2001). Though <b>WET</b> <b>tests</b> do not provide indication of the specific cause(s) of toxicity, they can contribute to address the overall effects that a mixture of pollutants might produce on the aquatic environment (EPA 2000, Nieto 2000, Rodriguez et al. 2006).
