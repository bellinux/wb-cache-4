25|$|Paul {{emerged in}} 2000 {{as the largest}} {{contributor}} to Senatorial candidate Hillary Clinton. Paul and his attorneys have at various times offered two explanations for this. First, {{that he was trying}} to attract her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, to serve on the board of Stan Lee Media after leaving office. Second, that he hoped to negotiate a pardon for his previous criminal convictions. Paul produced and underwrote what he described as the largest fund raising event ever held for a federal candidate, in Los Angeles, days before the 2000 Democratic Convention began. The Hollywood Farewell Gala Salute to President <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Clinton</b> featured prominent entertainers singing for the President, while raising over $1 million for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The event cost $1.9 million to organize according to Paul and $500,000 according to the Federal Election Commission filing, much of it borrowed fraudulently by Paul from Merrill Lynch. Later indictments would state that Merrill Lynch lost about $5 million it had lent to Paul.|$|E

40|$|The first Democratic {{president}} for twelve years, <b>Williams</b> <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Clinton</b> entered the White House on {{a note of}} optimism, pledged to give priority to economic policy and his domestic agenda of healthcare and welfare reforms. President Clinton - the 'Man from Hope' - faced {{what looked like a}} fresh opportunity to move ahead with legislation. The years of 'gridlock', whereby a president of one political party faced a Congress dominated by another, were over. In the event the presidency of these years faced major difficulties. Clinton had been elected on 43 percent of the vote, and Congressional Democrats, far from winning election on Clinton's coattails, were ahead of him in their constituencies. Working with Congress was a formidable task, especially with the heavy agenda of the economic recovery package, the North America Free Trade Agreement, health and welfare bills. Uncertainties abroad, from Somalia to Haiti, from Bosnia to Northern Ireland, added to the pressures on the White House. The first two years of the Clinton presidency were seen by observers as one of successes and missteps, of continued questions of character and political style, of wide fluctuations in the president's popularity and achievements. After November 1994, when the Republicans gained control of both chambers of Congress- the House of Representatives {{for the first time in}} forty years - the years of gridlock and confrontation seemed set to return with a vengeance. But two years later Clinton was reelected to a second term. The 'comeback kid' had shown once again his resilience, political abilities and refusal to accept setbacks. But it was a different Clinton: the centrist 'New Democrat' had moved to the right, accommodating to a Republic-driven domestic agenda.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were 1) {{to find out the}} kinds of speech acts employed in the two apology speeches of President Clinton, I Misled and I Have Sinned based on Searle‟s theory on illocutionary forces, 2) to find out the context of situation that influences the speeches, and 3) to explain the arrangements of classical rhetoric speeches in the delivery of President Clinton‟s apology speeches. This study applied a descriptive-qualitative research. The object of this study was all utterances spoken by President <b>William</b> “Bill” <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Clinton</b> in his two apology speeches during the Lewinsky scandal, I Misled and I Have Sinned. The data were in the form of words, phrases, utterances, and discourse uttered by him in the apology speeches. The researcher has the role of planning, collecting, analysing, and reporting the research finding. A set of Clinton‟s speeches, the speech transcripts, and the data sheets were also employed as supporting instruments. Some steps were undertaken during the data collection: watching the videos of the speeches, finding their transcripts, making data sheets, and categorising. The researcher collected documents to do an in-depth learning process and interpretations. This technique of collecting data was a non-interactive technique. This research was principally using credibility, dependability and conformability to check the trustwothiness of the data. The research result showed that there was a different approach to be made from his first to his second apology speech under the essence of embracing the society‟s forgiveness. That attitude was represented through illocutionary acts performed by him. The most illocutionary acts performed was representatives under the act of convincing. In his second apology, he did not perform offensive acts such as protesting, blaming, and refuting which means that he changed his attitude, to maintain harmony between the speaker and the hearers. Mostly, regretting, apologizing, and thanking were performed as illocutionary acts of expressives. In the result of the arrangement of classical rhetoric, among six parts of rhetoric, the most dominant for both speeches is proof. However, what became so different is about the content itself. Proofs that were presented in I Misled showed self-defense for the speaker instead of giving more elaboration on apology purposes. On the contrary, I Have Sinned gave more elaboration on its proof to show the purpose of apologising. Thus, his second apology was more effective because he gave himself credibility through the use of structure and language by making himself sound sincere and by not placing the blame on his opponents. He formed the minds of his audience and made them elaborate on the information to create their own opinions that he was innocent. If the idea of his innocence came from within their minds, they would in turn accept his apology, support him, and take the actions that he asked them to...|$|R
