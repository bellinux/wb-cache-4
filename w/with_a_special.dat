5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts.

5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of}} the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{suffered}} {{a series of}} minor strokes in the late 1960s, which {{marked the beginning of}} a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, The Freak, a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including The Kid and The Circus. In 1971, he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, he was honoured <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> award by the Venice Film Festival.|$|E
