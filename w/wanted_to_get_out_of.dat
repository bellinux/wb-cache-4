5|$|It is {{said that}} Emperor Akbar (r. 15561605) who was enamored by Parveen's beauty had taken her to his palace in Agra to be his courtesan. But Parveen, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the situation, {{composed}} a gazal or a couplet which stated her status as an already used woman not fit for an emperor, which enabled her to get release from Akbar's court and return to Orchha.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{their comfort}} zone {{with the overall}} sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard {{has said that he}} initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The Sinatra period saw extravagant {{parties and}} visits by celebrities such as Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Kim Novak, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz and Richard Crenna. However, his mood swings would {{sometimes}} determine how {{he responded to}} patrons. Journalist Herb Caen reported {{that he could be}} dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him. Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Following this, Sinatra decided he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in the national press and pursued by law enforcement over illegal activities at the casino. The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros. Records and Sinatra gaining a one-third ownership in the new company.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the album's creation each Weezer member asked themselves what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the album. With that in mind, they set out to record. Recording was done in three sessions. Half of the album was recorded during the spring of 2007 with Rick Rubin overseeing production. The second session, started in July and finished on October 18, was produced by Weezer themselves at Malibu. The third and final session of recording was done at the request of Geffen Records, who claimed that there was not enough commercial material on the album. This session was produced by Jacknife Lee and completed in March 2008.|$|E
500|$|After {{her second}} album, Jackson {{terminated}} business affairs with her family, commenting [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house, {{get out from}} under my father, {{which was one of the}} most difficult things that I had to do." [...] Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, Control, released in February 1986. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: [...] "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rat race." [...] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and hired John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. She also subsequently left the Jackson home in Encino, California and moved into her own apartment around this time. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house, get out from under my father, {{which was one of the}} most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him. McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting and production duo James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E
500|$|Hancock governed Massachusetts {{through the}} end of the Revolutionary War and into an {{economically}} troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins. Hancock took a hands-off approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock [...] "never really led" [...] and [...] "never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth." [...] Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office before the trouble came. Hancock's critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations. Historian James Truslow Adams wrote that Hancock's [...] "two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it". The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as Shays's Rebellion, which Hancock's successor James Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was reelected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels. Hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.|$|E

[...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him, stating, [...] "I've worked hard for my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in behind you and try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride." [...] McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father."

500|$|Zayat {{filed for}} Chapter 11 Bankruptcy {{protection}} in February 2010. He {{stated that the}} problem was that the Lexington branch of the bank worked with the Thoroughbred industry and was willing to restructure his loans, while the bank's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the equine lending business altogether. Stating that Fifth Third was [...] "reneging on its promises," [...] Zayat filed a countersuit in April 2010, alleging the bank engaged in deceptive and predatory lending practices. When he thought the bank was willing to restructure its loans, Zayat withdrew 67 horses he intended to sell at Keeneland's 2009 September and November sales and instead purchased 24 more yearlings. [...] He had also paid Fifth Third $4.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of breeding rights to Zensational, all of which left him low on cash when the bank called in its loans. Zayat said the bank was using [...] "scorched earth" [...] tactics and accused it of trying to put him out of business, explaining that had he known the bank would not extend his loans, he would have sold enough horses to make his payments.|$|E
500|$|Following his mother's {{successful}} {{career as a}} divorce lawyer, {{the family moved to}} Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school, recalling, [...] "When I was there I always felt: 'This is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. And I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> California.'" [...] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both [...] "enlightening and exhilarating". In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he studied theater and was in an improv group with Stephen Colbert, the No-Fun Mud Piranhas. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.|$|E
