The <b>Wireless</b> Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

25|$|Structured wiring {{competes with}} <b>wireless</b> systems in homes. While <b>wireless</b> systems {{certainly}} have convenience advantages, {{they also have}} drawbacks over copper-wired systems: the higher bandwidth of systems using Category 5e wiring typically support more than ten times the speeds of <b>wireless</b> systems for faster data applications and more channels for video applications. Alternatively, <b>wireless</b> systems are a security risk as they can transmit sensitive information to unintended users over similar receiver devices. <b>Wireless</b> systems {{are more susceptible to}} interference from other devices and systems, which can compromise performance.
