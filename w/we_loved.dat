Close behind the {{followed}} President Theodore Roosevelt with Secretary Elihu Root {{and other members of}} the Cabinet following. The procession moved through a vast throng to the Buffalo City Hall where the body, lying in state, was viewed by one hundred and fifty thousand people. Toward the end of the afternoon, Indians from the exposition, in their blankets and feathers, followed by their squaws filed by. The Indians liked President McKinley and they had come to see the Great Father. A few hours before they had sent a wreath of purple astors accompanied by the inscription: “Farewell of Geronimo, Blue Horse, Flat Iron and Red Shirt and the seven hundred braves of the Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Like President Lincoln and Garfield, President McKinley never abused authority except on the side of mercy. The martyred Great White Chief will stand in memory next to the Savior of mankind. <b>We</b> <b>loved</b> him living, we love him still.” As the Indians passed, each of them dropped a white carnation upon the President’s coffin.|$|E

500|$|Working {{closely with}} Midway Games (which {{developed}} four launch titles for the system) and {{taking advantage of}} the ten months following the Dreamcast's release in Japan, Sega of America worked to ensure a more successful U.S. launch with a minimum of 15 launch games. Despite lingering bitterness over the Saturn's early release, Stolar successfully managed to repair relations with major US retailers, with whom Sega presold 300,000 Dreamcast units. In addition, a pre-launch promotion enabled consumers to rent the system from Hollywood Video in the months preceding its September launch.

500|$|Progressive rock (also {{known as}} art rock) was {{ushered in the}} 1970s, {{directly}} following the combination of classical grandiosity and pop experimentalism from the 1960s. Although it reached widespread popularity, from 1976 onward, the genre declined in sales and was played with less frequency on FM radio. According to Breithaupt and Breithaupt, this created a vacuum for [...] "a host of new, milder 'serious' bands, whose humor (Queen), pop smarts (Supertramp), and style (Roxy Music, mach two) would ensure their survival into the eighties.... they met the melodic requirements of AM radio while still producing thoughtful, original work." [...] Bands like Queen and ELO played a type of progressive pop that was grounded in prog-rock without compromising their chart success. The Buggles' Geoff Downes, who considers his band to be a continuation of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and 10cc's progressive traditions, says: [...] "Those early 10cc records such as [...] 10cc and Sheet Music were pretty out there, and Godley & Creme took that even further. Even Abba had sections in their music that were quite intricate. <b>We</b> <b>loved</b> all that studio trickery and experimentation. Parallel to that were bands like Yes, who were experimenting in the studio in a more progressive rock format." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. <b>We</b> <b>loved</b> to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly".

It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives."

I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as <b>we</b> <b>loved</b> making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
