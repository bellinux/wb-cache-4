[...] Bar codes consist of two letters, followed by eight sequence digits, and a ninth digit {{which is the}} check digit. The first two letters are the type of service (RN for registered mail, PG for express post envelopes). The last two characters are the letters CA. [...] The check digit ignores the letters and only concern itself with the first 8 numeric digits. The scheme is to multiply each of those 8 digits by a different <b>weighting</b> <b>factor,</b> (8 6 4 2 3 5 9 7). Add up the total {{of all of these}} multiplications and divide by 11. [...] The remainder after dividing by 11 gives a number from 0 to 10. Subtracting this from 11 gives a number from 1 to 11. [...] That result is the check digit, except in the two cases where it is 10 or 11. [...] If 10 it is then changed to a 0, and if 11 then it is changed to a 5. [...] The check digit may be used to verify if a barcode scan is correct, or if a manual entry of the barcode is correct. The system of barcode digit checking is referred to as Modulo 11 or Modulus 11 digit calculation.|$|E

This model supports the decision making by providing <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> covering dredging cost, and social and environmental impacts. This model requires various input data which are dredging points, dredging machines, dewatering machines, disposal sites. Furthermore, for the model development, the researcher applied imaginary dredging project area for model assessment and analysis. We used a total of 5 cases of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination. It can classify <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination in 2 categories. The first category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for single-objective optimization and another category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for multi-objective optimization. The single-objective optimization is same that one <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 1. 0 and other <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 0. 0. The multi-objective optimization is used equality <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination or <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> from previous study. According to model simulation, it shows that cost of dredging is different approximately 18 % due to <b>weight</b> <b>factors.</b> Besides, the maximum cost is obtained when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of social impact is 1. 0. In contrast, minimum cost of dredging projects is discovered when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of cost is 1. 0. From the <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> in previous study, it illustrates that there are about 2 % beyond the minimum cost of dredging projects, and approximately 18 % less than maximum cost. Next study will be used real river dredging areas or simulation results of bed changes. The results of this study can be efficiently applied to 4 major rivers in Korea where periodical river dredging is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: The {{compound}} identification in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) {{is achieved}} by matching the experimental mass spectrum to the mass spectra in a spectral library. It is known that the intensities with higher m/z value in the GC-MS mass spectrum are the most diagnostic. Therefore, to increase the relative significance of peak intensities of higher m/z value, the intensities and m/z values are usually transformed {{with a set of}} <b>weight</b> <b>factors.</b> A poor quality of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> can significantly decrease the accuracy of compound identification. With the significant enrichment of the mass spectral database and the broad application of GC-MS, it is important to re-visit the methods of discovering the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> for high confident compound identification. Results: We developed a novel approach to finding the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> only through a reference library for high accuracy compound identification. The developed approach first calculates the ratio of skewness to kurtosis of the mass spectral similarity scores among spectra (compounds) in a reference library and then considers a <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> with the maximum ratio as the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factor.</b> We examined our approach by comparing the accuracy of compound identification using the mass spectral library maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The results demonstrate that the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> for fragment ion peak intensity and m/z value found by the developed approach outperform the current <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> for compound identification...|$|R

40|$|Equity {{considerations}} may {{justify the}} use of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> when estimating the costs of climate change. This paper reviews different <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> {{that have been used}} in the climate economics literature. Based on a simple model, it is shown that although the different <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> imply substantially different cost-damage estimates, they actually yield the same optimal emission reductions. This paradox is {{explained by the fact that}} some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted â€“ and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis. At present, when most of the global emissions of (fossil) CO 2 originate from the industrialised countries, the global optimal emissions are considerably lower if costs are weighted. However, the more the emissions in developing countries grow, the less important becomes the introduction of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> in cost-benefit analysis of climate change for the global emission reductions, in the model developed here. On a regional level, the introduction of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> continues to play an important role, implying substantially lower emissions in the rich region and slightly higher (!) in the poor.

Special emphasis is placed on anisotropy (ellipticity) of the <b>factors.</b> The <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> Of the objective analysis methods were empirically determined and are two dimensional in a horizontal plane (2, y). Most of these <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> are isotropic. However, anisotropic <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> have recently been used to give greater weight to the upstream and downstream observations as compared to those of the crosswind direction. A simple advection equation is used as a dynamical constraint in the numerical variational analysis in order to take into account quantitatively the effect of wind direction and speed on the anisotropy. A simple low-pass filter is also included in the variational formalism. A Greenâ€™s function, derived for the Eular equation, is used to discuss the theoretical basis of the isotropic and anisotropic <b>weighting</b> <b>factors.</b> The results obtained from the numerical variational analysis scheme suggest that the weights for the upstream and downstream observations should be of the same magnitude and as much as three times larger than the respective weights for the crosswind direction.
