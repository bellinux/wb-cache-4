[...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead. We want to earn stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near if you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E

2500|$|Despite earlier {{comments}} by Carruthers that [...] "Reese never wavered in {{her commitment to}} Bianca" [...] and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on [...] "turning" [...] Reese bisexual. [...] "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> of insane," [...] said Pratt. [...] "So we thought about making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided {{to stick with the}} message." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the inquest into Kopechne's death, Kennedy {{testified that}} he left the party at [...] "approximately 11:15 p.m." [...] When he {{announced}} {{that he was about to}} leave, Kopechne told him [...] "that she was desirous of leaving, if I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> enough to drop her back at her hotel." [...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown." [...] Kopechne told no one that she was leaving with Kennedy, and left her purse and hotel key at the party.|$|E

50|$|Drano Aerosol Plunger was {{developed}} in the late 1960s, intended as a safer product that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kinder</b> environmentally.

Drackett used cheaper propellants, a blend of propane and butane, in all its other products. However, the propellant mix created a fire hazard.|$|R
