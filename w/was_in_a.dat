40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) play {{an increasingly}} important role in maintaining geographically close romantic relationships (GCRR).

An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N= 272). Results showed that participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR reported higher levels of relational maintenance behaviors through SNS than participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR.
