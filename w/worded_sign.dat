50|$|Key <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> {{is a form}} of augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) that uses manual signing as an additional mode of communication with the intention of strengthening the message. Research suggests that lexical representations of <b>words,</b> including manual <b>signing,</b> as well as speech and graphic symbols, can be used to reinforce other lexical representations. This indicates that the use of AAC, including manual <b>signing</b> and key <b>word</b> <b>signing,</b> can be beneficial for speech and language interventions.|$|R

Derrida notes that Husserl makes a conceptual distinction {{in the use of}} the <b>word</b> <b>sign</b> between expression and indication. For Husserl, Derrida argues, the expression and the indication are both signs but the latter is a sign without meaning or sense. Expression intends towards an ideal meaning and is [...] "tied to the possibility of spoken language." ...|$|R

5000|$|Key <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> is a {{technique}} of simultaneous communication whereby the communication partner of the user will use both natural speech and also produce <b>signs</b> for the <b>words</b> that carry the most important information. Key <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> puts emphasis on the pertinent words in a sentence or a phrase, rather than <b>signing</b> every <b>word</b> like you would for American Sign Language (ASL). For example, if someone said, [...] "Go wash your hands" [...] the key words that would be signed would be [...] "wash" [...] and [...] "hand".|$|R

40|$|Effective {{literacy}} education in deaf students calls for psycholinguistic research revealing {{the cognitive and}} neural mechanisms underlying their written language processing. When learning a written language, deaf students are often instructed to sign out printed text. The present fMRI study was intended to reveal the neural substrates associated with <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> by comparing it with picture signing. Native deaf signers were asked to overtly sign in Chinese Sign Language (CSL) common objects indicated with written words or presented as pictures. Except in left inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule where <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> elicited greater activation than picture signing, the two tasks engaged a highly overlapping set of brain regions previously implicated in sign production. The results suggest that <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> in the deaf signers relies on meaning activation from printed visual forms, followed by similar production processes from meaning to signs as in picture signing. The present study also documents the basic brain activation pattern for sign production in CSL and supports {{the notion of a}} universal core neural network for sign production across different sign languages.

40|$|Background: Lámh {{is a key}} <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> {{approach}} used in Ireland, which can support the communication needs of children with Down syndrome. However, {{the success of this}} approach in mainstream schools relies heavily on the attitudes of those within the school environment. To date, two studies have explored the attitudes of teaching staff towards the use of keyword signing in schools; however, no previous research has investigated peer attitudes towards this method of communication. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of peers towards the use of Lámh by children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools. Materials and Methods: The study was qualitative, using interpretative phenomenological analysis procedures to analyse eight interviews with children, ranging in age from 6 to 8  years. Results and Conclusion: Overall, mainstream school peers demonstrated an understanding and an appreciation of the use of key <b>word</b> <b>signing.</b> However, the success of this approach within the school was limited by a number of challenges evinced by the school peers, including making the signs accurately and remembering their meanings. Given the important interactive role of the peers of a child with Down syndrome in a mainstream school setting, these challenges need to be addressed to optimise the use of key <b>word</b> <b>signing</b> and increase the likelihood of successful communication between children with Down syndrome and their peers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{question}} the almost universal assumption that <b>words</b> are <b>signs.</b> I first offer an interpretation of that assumption, which links it to the so-called thesis of the arbitrariness of the sign. I then draw out and explain one key commitment of the assumption, on that interpretation. This commitment of the view that <b>words</b> are <b>signs</b> appears to be open to an obvious objection, which I briefly explain. 1. What Everyone Assumes Almost everyone assumes that <b>words</b> are <b>signs,</b> although they often do so without noticing. Some hesitate a little before openly endorsing the assumption—either because they have a very particular understanding of what signs are, or because, once they are consider the assumption explicitly, they find they are not sure what signs are at all. But those who hesitate because they have a particular understanding of the notion of a sign are usually prepared to accept something a little looser or more contextualized, such as that languages (as wholes) are systems of signs; for my present purposes I will count such looser or more contextualized assumptions as just versions of the assumption that <b>words</b> are <b>signs,</b> and will take the assumption that <b>words</b> are <b>signs</b> itself as being to be understood in some suitabl...|$|R
