25|$|Scott {{was driven}} to a beach cottage, where the rope around his ankles was {{loosened}} sufficiently to enable him to make steps. Ross and his partners walked him into the house, {{one of the men}} leading him on a nylon leash, another holding his handcuffs. Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid to do. When Scott threatened Ross with criminal prosecution, Ross was said to have threatened Scott that he would handcuff him to the bed frame.|$|E
500|$|Lord of Scoundrels is {{typically}} {{classified as a}} Regency romance novel, though its story {{is set in the}} post-Regency era of 1828. It features a strong female heroine, a characteristic that Chase has become known for including in her romances. The author explains that [...] "for most of history, and in too many cases today, women are considered (and too often consider themselves) lesser beings who do not matter. In my books, the women are not lesser, and they do matter. In other words, I make the world the way I think it should be". Romantic fiction scholars have identified Jessica Trent as a [...] "feminist heroine" [...] with whom the [...] "alpha male hero" [...] has met his match. Chase inverts many qualities typical of the archetypical romantic hero and heroine. Near the end of the story, Jessica is the one who initiates consummation of their marriage, by seducing Dain. Afterwards, Jessica promptly falls asleep, causing her husband to seethe [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> supposed to do".|$|E
2500|$|Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized {{his friend}} and {{sometime}} client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, [...] "The question this government needs to answer is {{why it was so}} necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not willing to accept." [...] Cory Doctorow wrote, [...] "Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 {{he joined}} Mabel Greer's Toyshop as {{keyboard}} player with Peter Banks (guitar), Chris Squire (bass), Jon Anderson (vocals), and Bill Bruford (drums). In July 1968 {{they changed the}} name of the band to Yes, and with this line-up released two albums: Yes (1969) and Time and a Word (1970), and a few singles. In 1971, Yes released The Yes Album with guitarist Steve Howe replacing Banks. The opening track, [...] "Yours Is No Disgrace", was co-composed by Kaye, his first recorded composition. After a concert at The Crystal Palace in August 1971, Kaye was asked to leave the group. [...] His musical conservatism is often cited as the reason for his expulsion -- the group was looking to evolve, incorporating the Mellotron and synthesizers in their sound, while Kaye refused to play anything other than the Hammond organ and piano, namely because it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> most comfortable playing. Kaye {{had been part of the}} original recording sessions for some of the songs that appeared on Fragile, such as [...] "Heart of the Sunrise", with his keyboard parts being re-recorded by Rick Wakeman.|$|E

60|$|He {{learned to}} acquiesce to this, {{to submit to}} the awful, obliterated sources which were the origin of his living tissue. He was not what he {{conceived}} himself to be! Then he <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> unknown, potent, dark.|$|E

60|$|The Widow Douglas put Huck's {{money out}} at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher {{did the same}} with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request.

It was just what the {{minister}} got --no, it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.|$|E
6000|$|The Americans are {{not only}} the most hospitable people to {{be found on the}} face of the earth--they are (under certain conditions) the most patient and good-tempered people as well. But they are human; and the limit of American {{endurance}} is found in the obsolete institution of a bedroom candle. The American traveller, in the present case, declined to believe that his bedroom was in a complete finished state without a gas-burner. The manager pointed to the fine antique decorations (renewed and regilt) on the walls and the ceiling, and explained that the emanations of burning gas-light would certainly spoil them in the course of a few months. To this the traveller replied that it was possible, but that he did not understand decorations. A bedroom with gas in it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> used to, was what he wanted, and <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> determined to have. The compliant manager volunteered to ask some other gentleman, housed on the inferior upper storey (which was lit throughout with gas), to change rooms. Hearing this, and being quite willing to exchange a small bedchamber for a large one, Henry volunteered to be the other gentleman. The excellent American shook hands with him on the spot. 'You are a cultured person, sir,' he said; 'and you will no doubt understand the decorations.' ...|$|E

60|$|For the Bible {{is simply}} the revelation, or {{unveiling}} of God. It is not a book of natural science. It {{is not merely a}} book of holy and virtuous precepts.

Johnny Chuck wasn't in sight, but there was the new house, and Johnny must be either inside or not far away. Reddy grinned. It was a sly, wicked, hungry grin.

He knew that there were not even worms there. Besides, Mourner is not fond of worms; he lives almost altogether on seeds and grains of many kinds. So Peter was puzzled. But as you know he isn't the kind to puzzle long over anything when he can use his tongue.|$|E
