50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle <b>wheel.</b> <b>Cone</b> wrenches are thinner and lighter than most other open ended wrenches {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer axle nuts may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|E
5000|$|Marble Silde: {{also known}} as Rolling ball sculpture, Marble maze, marble run, marble rail, marble coaster. Used in such things as pinball {{machines}} and Rube Goldberg machines. A game of skill, involving building using; rails, tracks, <b>cones,</b> <b>wheels,</b> levers, and ramps.|$|R
50|$|The 1078 cc, air-cooled, Precision V {{twin engine}} with RAC rating of 9 hp was coupled to a {{friction}} drive which gave a varying drive ratio {{by moving the}} driven <b>wheel</b> along a <b>cone.</b> This then used bevel gerars to connect to a countershaft and thence to the rear wheels by a belt.|$|R
50|$|The car {{is powered}} by a water cooled, four {{cylinder}} 1460 cc four cylinder engine usually of the side valve type but some had overhead valves. The engine had a bore of 68mm and a stroke of 100mm. A Solex carburettor was used. This drove the rear <b>wheels</b> via a <b>cone</b> clutch and four speed gearbox. The chassis had rigid axles and half elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|The Silver Hawk {{was similar}} to Macklin's {{previous}} Eric-Campbell design. It had a stylish aluminium body, external exhaust and used a tuned and lightened 1,498cc side-valve engine made by Coventry-Simplex rated at 10/35 hp that drove the rear <b>wheels</b> through a <b>cone</b> clutch and three or four speed transmission. The suspension used semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and cantilever springs at the rear.|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, <b>wheels</b> or <b>cones.</b> Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a variable displacement pump and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed displacement pump and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|R
50|$|The Palmerston had a 6-9 hp Coventry-Victor water cooled, flat {{twin engine}} driving the rear <b>wheels</b> through a <b>cone</b> clutch, {{separately}} mounted three speed gearbox and bevel geared rear axle. The brakes acted {{on the rear}} wheels using a hand lever with the foot brake operating a transmission brake on the drive shaft behind the gearbox. The steel section chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs front and rear. The early cars had wire spoked wheels later replaced by steel disc type.|$|R
50|$|The Eric-Campbell 10 (10/22 in 1924) was {{assembled}} from bought-in components with a Coventry-Simplex 1498 cc, four cylinder, {{side valve}} engine driving the rear <b>wheels</b> through a <b>cone</b> clutch and three speed Moss gearbox. The engine was tuned {{with a special}} camshaft and lightened pistons. Half elliptic leaf springs were fitted at the front whilst at the rear cantilever springing was used. A top speed of 55 mph was guaranteed and 60 mph claimed as possible. Two seat polished aluminium bodies were fitted with a simulacrum of a Rolls-Royce radiator.|$|R
50|$|On lap 7, {{the second}} lap at racing speed, Senna's car left the racing {{line at the}} 190 mph Tamburello corner, ran in a {{straight}} line off the track and struck an unprotected concrete barrier. Telemetry shows he left the track at 310 km/h and was able to slow the car down by braking, and downshifting twice, to 218 km/h in slightly under 2 seconds before hitting the wall. The car hit the wall at a shallow angle, tearing off the right front <b>wheel</b> and nose <b>cone</b> and spinning to a halt.|$|R
5000|$|If the constabulary has any {{vehicles}} it {{may only}} be one. These are normally liveried in fluorescent colours and with amber flashing lights to increase their presence. New Spitalfield Market Constabulary operates a Ford Ranger with a bright red stripe, a twin rotating amber flashing light {{on the roof and}} the City of London crest and [...] "New Spitalfield Market Constabulary" [...] below that, on the rear sides of the vehicle. Inside the Truckman rear are <b>wheel</b> clamps, road <b>cones,</b> first aid kits, fire extinguisher and granules to soak up diesel spills.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} novel {{experimental methods}} aimed at understanding the fundamental phenomena governing {{the motion of}} lightweight vehicles on dry, granular soils. A single-wheel test rig is used to empirically investigate wheel motion under controlled wheel slip and loading conditions on sandy, dry soil. Test conditions can be designed to replicate typical field scenarios for lightweight robots, while key operational parameters such as drawbar force, torque, and sinkage are measured. This test rig enables imposition of velocities, or application of loads, to interchangeable running gears within a confined soil bin of dimensions 1. 5 m long, 0. 7 m wide, and 0. 4 m deep. This allows testing of small-scale <b>wheels,</b> tracks, and <b>cone</b> or plate penetrators. Aside from standard wheel experiments (i. e., measurements of drawbar force, applied torque, and sinkage during controlled slip runs) two additional experimental methodologies have been developed. The first relies on high-speed imaging of the wheel-soil interface {{and the use of}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure micro-scale terrain kinematics. The second experimental methodology consists of a custom force sensor array located at the wheel-terrain interface. The sensors allow explicit measurement of normal and shear forces (and, therefore, estimation of normal and shear stresses) at numerous discrete points along the wheel-soil interface. Experimental measurements gathered by these test methodologies are to be compared against well-established semi-empirical models, to validate and understand limitations of the models and propose improvements...|$|R

In the present work, the kinematics and dynamics of a wheelset was investigated. An idealized profile shapes for both rail and wheels were used. The profile of the rail is knife edge while that of the <b>wheel</b> is a <b>cone.</b> The kinematic analysis is based on a set of contact constraints between the rails and wheels. These constraints are used to simulate transverse sliding motion of the wheelset. The parameters of the contact equations are divided into a set of independent and dependent variables. Then a scheme based on this dichotomy is developed that incorporates a multi-level dependency among the dependent variables. For dynamic analysis, a specialized embedded D'Alembert-Lagrange formulation that incorporates a multi-level dependency among the dependent parameters was developed. The approach is designated as Modified Embedded D'Alembrt-Lagrange (MEDL) in this work. MEDL is used to model a spinning wheelset and study its dynamics. In the spinning wheelset model, friction forces at contacts are incorporated using the coulomb friction model. To compute the dry friction, normal force is first evaluated by computing the Lagrange multipliers first. Then the generalized forces associated with friction contact forces are computed. A simulation study for the spinning wheelset model for several forward studies is conducted. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the output of simulation studies are used to identify the hunting frequencies. These hunting frequencies are compared to those predicted by Klingel's Formulae. A good agreement between the hunting frequencies is observed...|$|R
