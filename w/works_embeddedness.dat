40|$|Adolescent {{penetration}} {{into the}} labor market is a relatively new, and much understudied, phenomena. To date, limited empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} extensive employment of adolescents increases their offending. We bring together insights garnered from life-course criminology, which emphasizes the timing of transitional role changes; and economic sociology, which draws attention to the "social embeddedness" of development and decision-making. The objective is to test whether a youth's embeddedness within {{the labor market}} has deleterious consequences for the youth's behavior. Our results show that <b>work</b> <b>embeddedness</b> is positively related to delinquency, and that this effect is not accounted for by prior levels of delinquent involvement. These findings were replicated by use of a community sample. In total our findings suggest that being embedded in a work role as a teenager has general deleterious consequences for behavior.

40|$|Discussions {{of middle}} Bengali Muslim works have rarely {{focused on the}} {{aesthetic}} dimensions of this strand of literature. The in-depth analysis of the earliest Bengali version of the famous tale of Joseph and Zulaikha attempted here shows its connections to many Islamic literary traditions, such as {{the stories of the}} prophets, the maṯnawī (in this case of ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān Ǧāmī) and the north Indian 'premākhyān'. Most importantly, however, the focus on the poetic form also allows reconstructing the story’s re-creation along a specific aesthetics of performance and response. While the new ending that is added in the Bengali version in many ways reflect the <b>work’s</b> <b>embeddedness</b> in North Indian literary traditions and the history of regionalization during the late Mogul empire, the most important means for the story’s recreation lies on the plain of its metrical structure. While it largely follows the maṯnawī by employing its equivalent, the Bengali meter of paẏār, other meters are used as well, most often the tripadī. In the first systematic probe into the semantic function of such a metrical system which is typical for many middle Bengali works, the alternation of different meters is linked with the alternation of the narrative modes of diegesis and mimesis. This excavation of important aspects of the aesthetics of production and reception considerably stands in contrast to judgments denying the middle Bengali Muslim works an aesthetic structure of their own and opens up comparative questions in different directions. It contributes to an overdue shift in the study of pre-colonial Muslim traditions in Bengal, from teleological paradigms of identity towards a literary history which asks the texts what they tell us about their recipients’ expectation and reception. ...|$|R
40|$|The Guyanese {{novelist and}} critic Wilson Harris defines the word fossil in an {{idiosyncratic}} sense, to invoke ‘a rhythmic capacity to re-sense contrasting spaces {{and to suggest}} that a curious rapport exists between ruin and origin as latent to arts of genesis’ – prior to hinting that such a ‘heterogeneous scale’ of temporality can be seen to exist within the fictional universe fashioned by Janet Frame. This, in turn, implies that any appreciation of her <b>work’s</b> <b>embeddedness</b> in local (South Pacific) realities must simultaneously take account of the depths of spatiality created by means of her particular aesthetics. This article attempts to address Frame’s strange interest in ghostly vestiges of superseded experience, which she expresses through recurring allusions to subterranean strata of landscape encrypting a sense of ‘epochs and ages gone’ – as she phrases this in Living in the Maniototo. Indeed her settings beg the question of a ‘native capacity’ (another Harrisian phrase) possibly underlying her approach to New Zealand contemporary culture. Intriguingly, she probes the matter through her repeated evocation of reputedly extinct animal species – dinosaur, moa, takahe – which she sees in some cases to be gesturing towards the possibility of resuscitation, as with the tuatara mentioned in Towards Another Summer, and quite in keeping with an aesthetics of excavation subordinated to her quest for occulted forms of being and knowing. As some of Frame’s characters conceive this, {{it is a matter of}} realising that ‘the human eye is not consistent’ and can be supplemented through a form of third-eye vision paradoxically inherited in spite of the losses of history.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study was: (1) to determine the relationship between job embeddedness (measured by the Job <b>Embeddedness</b> Scale), <b>work</b> engagement (measured by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale), and turnover intention (measured by the Turnover Intention Scale); and (2) to determine whether employees from different groups, namely age, race, gender, marital status and tenure differ significantly in their levels of job <b>embeddedness,</b> <b>work</b> engagement and turnover intention. A quantitative survey was conducted on a non-probability purposive sample (N = 153) of staff in a higher education institution. Correlational analyses revealed significant relationships between job <b>embeddedness,</b> <b>work</b> engagement and turnover intention. Multiple regression analyses showed that organisation links and dedication negatively predicted the participants’ turnover intention. Significant differences between age, race, gender, marital status and tenure were also found. The findings contribute valuable knowledge {{to the field of}} Career Psychology and can be applied in the retention of employees in the higher education institution.

40|$|Orientation: The {{world economy}} is {{becoming}} increasingly knowledge driven, and intellectual capital is now considered as a human resource that affords organisations a competitive advantage. A high turnover rate in higher education {{and the importance of}} retaining staff are concerns that have resulted in increased interest in psychological variables, such as job <b>embeddedness</b> and <b>work</b> engagement that may influence employee retention. Research purpose: The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the relationship between job <b>embeddedness,</b> <b>work</b> engagement and turnover intention of staff in a higher education institution. Motivation for the study: Research on how employees’ job <b>embeddedness</b> and <b>work</b> engagement influence their turnover intention is important in the light of organisational concerns about retaining knowledgeable staff in the current higher education environment. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted on a non-probability purposive sample (N = 153) of academic and non-academic staff in a South African higher education institution. Main findings: Correlational analyses revealed significant relationships between job <b>embeddedness,</b> <b>work</b> engagement and turnover intention. Multiple regression analyses showed that organisational links and dedication significantly and negatively predict turnover intention. Practical/managerial implications: When designing retention strategies, management and human resource practitioners need to recognise how job <b>embeddedness</b> and <b>work</b> engagement influence the turnover intention of higher education staff.

40|$|Developing on Granovetter’s classic <b>work</b> on <b>embeddedness</b> {{in systems}} of social relations, this paper proposes {{the concept of}} ‘differentiated embedding’ to explore how {{migrants}} negotiate attachment and belonging as dynamic temporal, spatial and relational processes. When Poland joined the EU in May 2004 the large flow of migrants to the UK was perceived by many migration researchers as heralding {{a new form of}} transient mobility associated with short-term, temporary and circular migration, and high levels of transnationalism. Relatively little attention was paid to how these migrants were integrating in local contexts. Based on 20 in-depth interviews and network mapping with Polish migrants,resident in London for a decade, I examine why participants extended their stay and how their decisions were shaped by inter-personal relationships locally and transnationally. London as a ‘super-diverse’, global city offers place–specific opportunities for building networks and developing processes of embedding. Nonetheless, a focus on networks risks overlooking the wider structural context in which migrants live and work. Thus, I argue, {{there is a need for}} a differentiated concept to capture the nuanced interplay of structural, relational, spatial and temporal embedding. This concept not only captures multi-scalarity and multi-sectorality but also levels of belonging and attachment. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper furthers the {{analysis}} of patterns regulating capitalist accumulation based on a historical anthropology of economic activities revolving around and within the Mauritian Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Design/methodology/approach This paper uses fieldwork in Mauritius to interrogate and critique two important concepts in contemporary social theory – “embeddedness” and “the informal economy. ” These are viewed in the wider frame of social anthropology’s engagement with (neoliberal) capitalism. Findings A process-oriented revision of Polanyi’s <b>work</b> on <b>embeddedness</b> and the “double movement” is proposed to help us situate EPZs within ongoing power struggles found {{throughout the history of}} capitalism. This helps us to challenge the notion of economic informality as supplied by Hart and others. Social implications Scholars and policymakers have tended to see economic informality as a force from below, able to disrupt the legal-rational nature of capitalism as practiced from on high. Similarly, there is a view that a precapitalist embeddedness, a “human economy,” has many good things to offer. However, this paper shows that the practices of the state and multinational capitalism, in EPZs and elsewhere, exactly match the practices that are envisioned as the cure to the pitfalls of capitalism. Value of the paper Setting aside the formal-informal distinction in favor of a process-oriented analysis of embeddedness allows us better to understand the shifting struggles among the state, capital, and labor...|$|R
40|$|Has {{sociology}} {{become more}} socially integrated {{over the last}} 30 years? Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns {{and the structure of}} ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960 s characterizes the discipline’s coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work {{is more likely to be}} coauthored than non-quantitative <b>work.</b> However, structural <b>embeddedness</b> within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.

40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{literature}} on institutional work has identified power relations between incumbents and challengers of the institutional status quo as a key determinant in institutional processes, we still {{know very little about}} how these power structures actually operate. Drawing on a definition of power as fix and reified meanings, we study how one type of power relation, namely hierarchical structure, has policed the institutional sensemaking of an emergent occupational group who was supposed to carry new regulative templates challenging the prevalence of the Corporate logic in French hospitals. Using an inductive methodology combining survey and focus group data, we observe that the hierarchical power structure typical of the Corporation has shaped the typifications of this group through a disciplinary form of control similar to the one described by Foucault in his analysis of Bentham’s Panopticon. Relying on the progressive elaboration of the concept of discipline in Foucault’s work, we subsequently highlight how the structural vision of agency that he has proposed could help enrich our understanding of institutional agency and complexity, thereby opening new potential research avenues to address some of the current gaps in {{the literature}} on institutional <b>work</b> regarding contextual <b>embeddedness</b> and institutional deviance...|$|R
40|$|The {{sources of}} value {{creation}} are increasingly relying on intangible assets (IAs). IAs are {{the lifeblood of}} knowledge-intensive industries where the new value added is disproportionally based on specialized, non-repetitious activities. However, while the role of IAs is recognised as central to sustain the competitiveness of firms and innovation systems, {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms through which IAs display their effects has not yet been fully grasped. By focussing on the processes through which investments in IAs occur, this paper aims to explore the key dimensions through which two specific IAs – organisational and network capital – are enhanced and contribute to the innovativeness and embeddedness of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) in regional innovation systems. On the basis of over forty in-depth interviews to leading staff of German and UK flagship MNEs operating in the automotive, life science and ICT sectors, the paper shows that MNEs adopt rather distinctive strategies to develop IAs; that MNE degree of local embeddedness is strictly related to both the kind of IA strategy and the local environment; and that causation mechanisms are at <b>work</b> between MNE <b>embeddedness</b> and regional creation of IAs.

40|$|The {{research}} {{draws from}} anthropological work on social exchange and later <b>work</b> on <b>embeddedness</b> in {{an exploration of}} how personal networks shape business. The purpose of the research is to contribute {{to an understanding of}} how social relations shape economic processes and vice versa. The research takes its starting point in small manufacturing firms in southern Sweden primarily in the plastics industry. Internal and external relations of these firms are studied using qualitative methods and formal network analysis. Qualitative methods are used to identify important mechanisms of personal networks. It is argued that personal networks provide a domain of interaction outside short term economic rationality but at the same time, the development of personal networks is fuelled by the need for coordination in achieving business ends. Particularly personal networks are pivotal for gaining access to diverse sets of expertise. Personal networks are shown to {{be an integral part of}} both effective production and development in these firms. This is in stark contrast to notions of impersonal markets and bureaucracy that still shape much of discourse on business. Formal network analysis, starting form recurring problems of coordinating production, provides an important complement and expansion of the findings. It becomes evident that certain structures of informal organization provide individuals with means of gaining recognition and a means of navigating a dynamic environment. The same structures are also found to be important for firm development. These networks provide a better basis for acquiring useful information and integrating this meaningfully in the firm. A strong correlation exists between the structure of informal organization and firm growth. The research develops relatively simple methods to differentiate a beneficial informal organization from less beneficial ones in terms of firm development. It also outlines factors shaping the development of beneficial personal network structures in and between firms. These findings, if corroborated in subsequent research, have important implications both for understanding knowledge development and growth of firms and also for understanding how individuals are shaped by the informal structures of their work experience. Hopefully, the research will stimulate further dialogue between anthropology and research on social embeddedness...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} a multilateral law enforcement cooperation, the Baltic Sea Task Force, and explain some of the factors that may be the reasons for its successful implementation. Choosing to see the Baltic Sea Task Force framework similar to an attempt to create a cooperation forming one international epistemic community from several national ones, I investigate how and to what extent knowledge has been transferred between the communities, and how this was planned for in the original mission mandate. I investigate problems of knowledge transfer across the network of communities (national law enforcement agencies). Since knowledge is context based, the specific context encodes the knowledge, reflecting the nature of the subject area and the community’s norms and values. Explicit knowledge needs embedded tacit understanding to fully <b>work.</b> In turn, <b>embeddedness</b> needs trust, common processes, joint norms and values. Consequently, there must also be a transfer of these norms and values in order for the embeddedness to take place. I investigate how this context-dependent knowledge is received, and how such decoding is assisted by the framework. Where decoding seems to have been slow, I examine possible reasons for this, and study how the framework has dynamically altered its modi operandi to achieve its purpose. I conclude that the Baltic Sea Task Force framework’s enterprise policy contains a broad and holistic perspective, conforming to definitions of a holistic epistemic community...|$|R
40|$|The emotive {{issue of}} child {{prostitution}} {{is at the}} heart of international debates over ‘trafficking’ in women and girls, the “new slave trade”, and how these phenomena are linked with globalization, sex tourism, and expanding transnational economies. However, young sex workers, particularly those in the ‘third world’, are often represented through tropes of victimization, poverty, and “backwards” cultural traditions, constructions that rarely capture the complexity of the girls’ experiences and the role that prostitution plays in their lives. Based on ethnographic fieldwork with girls and young women who are part of the Devadasi (servant/slave of the God) system of sex work in India, this paper introduces an alternative example of child prostitution. Demonstrating the ways in which this practice is socially, economically, and culturally embedded in certain regions of rural south India underlies this new perspective. I argue that this <b>embeddedness</b> <b>works</b> to create, inform, and give meaning to these girls as they grow up in this particular context, not to isolate and produce totally different experiences of family, gender identity, and moral character as popular accounts of child prostitution contend. Data pertaining to socialization, ‘positive’ aspects of being a young sex worker in this context, political economy, HIV/AIDS, and changes in the Devadasi tradition are used to support my position. Taken together, this alternative example presents a more complex understanding of the micro- and macro-forces that impact child prostitution as well as the many factors that affect the girls’ ideas of what they do and who they are as people, not just sex workers...|$|R
40|$|In the workplace, the {{prospect}} for learning occurs {{not only through}} formal training programmes but also effectively and prolifically through opportunities embedded in everyday <b>work</b> activities. This <b>embeddedness</b> raises still-unanswered questions about how such incidental learning is shaped by aspects of the workplace environment. From that view, the numerous means through which the general workplace environment can influence incidental learning arguably creates a significant gap in the theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. The specific gap addressed by this study is ‘How is incidental learning influenced by aspects of workplace culture?’ To investigate this gap, the study explored perceptions of employees {{on the impact of}} aspects of workplace culture on incidental learning within a manufacturing environment; specifically, the Volta Aluminium Company (VALCO) in Ghana. For this study, workplace culture refers to both organisational-wide cultures and subcultures within organisations. Thus this research examined employees’ means of incidental learning and ways the different aspects of organisation-wide cultures and subcultures support or suppress incidental learning. A phenomenological lens was employed to conduct in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 30 employees selected through quota, purposive, and snowballing sampling methods. The data obtained were analysed through multiple theoretical lenses. The findings showed that employees acquire knowledge through participatory, inquisitorial, and observational means. The findings also provide specific cultural artefacts/practices, values, and assumptions toward a general understanding of the learning/culture relationship and for constructing models for learning-supportive and learning-inhibitive cultures and subcultures at the workplace. The study further demonstrates that employees may have overlapping or multiple identities, which sometimes makes the identification of cultures or subcultures problematic...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} development in one region or locale {{can be associated with}} and explained by socio-cultural and socio-spatial factors. This premise is well-supported by an institutional and historical analysis. The increasing number of <b>works</b> on social <b>embeddedness</b> and formation of entrepreneurial culture highlight again a well-known phrase of institutional economics: history matters. Economic growth in one region can be closely associated with broad historical processes and initial advantages. The Turkish case offers a suitable context for this institutional analysis outlined above. The initial advantages that are most evident in the irreversible development trajectories of the commercial centres like Istanbul and Izmir are also expressive in the emerging regional and sub-regional growth centres like Anatolian Tigers. Anatolian Tigers refer a number of new growth centres that put up a good and consistent performance in manufacturing industry since the 1980 s. Two Anatolian Tigers, Konya (well-known) and Karaman (less-known) locating in South-Central Anatolia constitute the geographical scope of this paper. The sub-region of Konya-Karaman is not only delineated by normative criteria but also defined historically and geographically. This makes the area a historical region of established commercial culture. Konya is an important regional centre of commercial, industrial, agricultural and service activities in Turkey especially with its nationally strategic industrial establishments and grain production. Since the 1980 s, Konya has experienced an important development in the manufacturing industry. Karaman that is an important industrial and commercial centre of Central Anatolia at both provincial and urban levels is commonly not known or termed as an Anatolian Tiger but it displays a number of historical peculiarities (administrative, socio-economic and geographic) are crucial to comprehend the historical roots of recent commercial and industrial development of Tigers and other redeveloping centres in Anatolia. In the re-emergence of Konya and Karaman as regional growth centres, locational, social and political factors contributed positively to the perpetual socio-{{economic development}} in Anatolian Seljuk, Karamanogullari, Ottoman and Republican periods. In conclusion, from the perspective of institutional economics, this paper examines the role of historical-geographical factors in the formation of an entrepreneurial culture in the sub-region of Konya and Karaman...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{heightened}} {{interest in}} creating local food systems that enhance health of ecologies, economies, and {{all members of}} communities, the public space of farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets is far less than inherently equitable. This is particularly concerning given America 2 ̆ 7 s unprecedented crisis of food hardship and related disease, which disproportionately affects lower income populations. This research addresses the social justice implications of SNAP (food stamp) operations for locally oriented food systems. Pioneering practices of three of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s SNAP-authorized farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets, and the attitudes and behaviors of one-hundred-seventy-six market patrons, were explored through customer surveys, market manager interviews, and environmental assessments. Qualitative and quantitative results uncovered associations between SNAP at the farmers 2 ̆ 7 market and heightened <b>embeddedness.</b> This <b>work</b> advances the <b>embeddedness</b> concept by applying it to the understudied population of lesser advantaged consumers for which the interplay of marketness and embeddedness is particularly relevant to food purchasing decisions. Qualitative results showed success in SNAP operations centered on extending the reach of healthy foods to greater share of community, enhancing local farm income, and repositioning farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets from their reputation as exclusive and expensive. Despite being heterogeneous place-making spaces with unique socio-cultural qualities, the markets shared commonality in their EBT operations and strong mission to serve the local SNAP population. Nonetheless, capacity for implementing and sustaining SNAP operations appears contingent upon innovative strategies and long-range synergistic efforts. Quantitative results uncovered several benefits in attaching SNAP to farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets: expanded diversity of patron demographics, strengthened market-shopping behavior, diminished tension between economic and non-economic in food valuation, and fortification of the market as a social space for effecting change. Much remains to be understood regarding consumer values tied to local food systems, {{and the impact of}} SNAP operations on embedded market exchange. Hence, it is premature to predict whether SNAP operations will indeed enable farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets to serve as a transformative mechanism for addressing the social justice arm of sustainability in the developing, alternative food system. Nonetheless, the discoveries made herein hint at the viability for SNAP to better position farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets aiming to strengthen food system justice; and in so doing, bolster the role of farmers 2 ̆ 7 markets in helping communities move towards their sustainability objectives...|$|R
