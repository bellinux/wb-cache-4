5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia's 2000 census {{reported}} 2,411,503 citizens (1.20 {{percent of}} the total population) as ethnic Chinese. An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|During Cruzado's {{presidency}} {{there have}} been several notable successes in the area of advancement. Alumnus Jake Jabs agreed to donate $3 million in December 2010 to add to the endowment of the Jake Jabs Center for Entrepreneurship for the New West, a unit of the MSU College of Business. It was his second major donation to the center. After alumni quietly raised $1 million to expand Bobcat Stadium, Cruzado went public in October 2010 with a campaign to raise an additional $4 million and agreed to match the fund-raising up to $4 million with university funds. The campaign was a rousing success, raising $5 million in private funds in less than a year. In 2011, alumnus David Kern and his wife, Judith Raines, donated $1 million to MSU to establish the Presidential Award for Emerging Scholars. The award targets students <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> academically outstanding, but who exhibit great promise in leadership, academics, or research. It was the second major gift from Kern and Raines, who previously established an engineering scholarship in 2002. In October 2012, the university received one of its largest gifts ever when Jabs donated an additional $25 million to build a new business school building. Courting of Jabs had occurred for a decade. The donation was the largest in MSU history.|$|E
25|$|During the May 27, 2015 CMLL Informa show it was {{revealed}} that Negro Casas would be the trainer for Blue Panther Jr, Canelo Casas, Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr. while Virus would be the trainer for Zavala, Disturbio, Esfinge and Flyer. Three out of the four wrestlers on Virus' team were already in his wrestling class, adding Disturbio to the group. During the CMLL Informa episode the announcers pushed the storyline that Casas might have a harder time with his team, training the son of long time rival Blue Panther, Casas' nephew and the two most experienced wrestlers in the group <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> as open to his input as a trainer. During the first round Guerrero Maya Jr. earned 100 points from winning five matches in total during the seven-week round-robin tournament, the most of any of the participants while Flyer only earned 30 points for one victory (over Blue Panther Jr.) and a draw against Canelo Casas, the least of any participant. Guerrero Maya Jr. was also the person to get the highest accumulated score from the judges, a total of 221 points, with Delta receiving the lowest collective score a total of 132 points. The online poll had Boby Zavala as the top point earner with 221 points and Blue Panther Jr as the lowest with only 53 points in total. While Flyer scored low both in matches and with the judges the fan polls were strongly in his favor during the last four weeks that it moved him into fifth position. Blue Panther Jr., who was already the lowest ranked competitor, did not work his final match of the first round, with CMLL claiming force majure, replacing him in the match with Hechicero who wrestled against Delta but did not get any points. His no-show did not change his rankings as he could not possibly have ended higher than seventh place. For the last week of the first round it looked as if Flyer would be in third place as long as he got decent points from the judges due to his strong poll numbers, but he was forced {{to pull out of the}} match due to a foot injury. Due to this CMLL had Guerrero Maya Jr. wrestle against Tritón. By not scoring any points from the judges at all Flyer felt to fourth position. In the end Guerrero Maya Jr., Bobby Zavala, Esfinge and Disturbio all qualified for the second round. Between rounds trainer Negro Casas will team up with Guerrero Maya Jr. and Boby Zavala to take on Virus, Esfinge and Disturbio as part of the July 24 Super Viernes show.|$|E

Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride.
