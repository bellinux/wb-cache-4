5|$|The {{video is}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} and switches between them throughout. The first has band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon they hit a deer. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack them before going on a rampage in their International Harvester Scout. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.|$|E

60|$|As a whole, however, {{these have}} not great reason for sadness. Not {{more than a}} third of them are boarders, and the rest, who have in truth, for the last week, begun to be tired of their holidays, will, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> once <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of school, and begin to choose sides for football, be really glad that the term has again commenced.|$|R

He's got a horse of his own with him, and he'll be beyond reach of the police by this time to-morrow. Indeed, he's beyond their reach now. However, you'll have got rid of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't,' {{said the}} Squire. 'I suppose {{he was a}} little wild out there, but that is a very {{different}} thing from bigamy. Young men, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> to those places, are not quite so particular as they ought to be, I daresay. When I was young, perhaps I was not as steady as I ought to have been. But, by George! here is a man comes over and asks for a lot of money; and then the woman asks for money; and then they say that if they don't get it, they'll swear the fellow was married in Australia. I can't fancy that any jury will believe that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So they are; the {{marriage}} {{is to be a}} civil one. They will merely declare themselves man and wife in the presence of an official; he will enter them as such in a register, and the affair will be over. I would not say so to Arnold, but I have serious doubt whether the American authorities would recognize the ceremony as a legal one, did she ever appear there to claim possession. Of course, if he gets away also, it can be put right by another marriage <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> or they can stop for a few weeks on their way through England, and be married again there." ...|$|E

Anna tells him that she is leaving town with her mom and Jeremy kisses her. Anna's face begins to show that she is a vampire and Jeremy asks her what is going on when Ben appears and knocks him out. Anna tells Ben to drag Jeremy close to the tomb so they can use him for Pearl to feed on <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> her <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|Another mistake {{which really}} pious and good people commit, is, {{that they think}} the Holy Spirit of God to be merely, or little beside, certain {{pleasant}} frames, and feelings, and comfortable assurances, in their own minds. They {{do not know that}} these pleasant frames and feelings really depend principally on their own health: and, then, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of health, or when their brain is overworked, and the pleasant feelings go, they are terrified and disheartened, and complain of spiritual dryness, and cry out that God's Spirit has deserted them, and are afraid that God is angry with them, or even that they have committed the unpardonable sin: not knowing that God is not a man that He should lie, nor a son of man that He should repent; that God is as near them in the darkness as in the light; that whatever their own health, or their own feelings may be, yet still in God they live, and move, and have their being; that to God's Spirit they owe all which raises them above the dumb animals; that nothing can separate them from the love of Him who promised that He would not leave us comfortless, but send to us His Holy Ghost to comfort us, and exalt us to the same place whither He has gone before.|$|E

50|$|Notre Dame took a 22-19 lead in {{the fourth}} quarter before Michigan scored late to retake the lead, 26-22. The referees made a {{controversial}} call of excessive celebration on the go-ahead TD. Poor clock management proved costly for Notre Dame. Out of time outs, the Irish drove frantically downfield only to have time run <b>out</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could not <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bounds.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for Liverpool, Twentyman’s {{signature}} couldn't {{prevent them}} from being relegated {{by the end of}} his first season at the club, in fact all of Twentyman's Liverpool appearances were during the dark days in Anfield’s history <b>when</b> <b>they</b> struggled to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the 2nd Division, even though they were finishing consistently just outside the promotion places. Twentyman featured in 184 matches scoring 19 goals before leaving Liverpool.|$|R

50|$|The film {{begins in}} a large garage structure, where Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) and Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano) meet up with former cadets, (now Sgts.) Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman). It seems {{one of the two}} police academies is getting the axe due to the state government's unwillingness to {{continue}} financing two academies, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure Lassard screws up. The men agree to the plan, knowing this may be their only chance at revenge at Lassard for (somewhat deservingly) graduating them at the bottom of their class. Afterwards, Mauser and Proctor find themselves and their car stuck inside the garage (as they were forewarned it was closing soon), but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> both <b>get</b> <b>out</b> to try to forcibly open the gate arm, the car falls out of park and starts rolling backwards down the ramp, while Proctor tries futilely to stop it.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009 Gil Kerlikowske, {{the current}} Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, {{signaled}} that the Obama Administration {{would not use}} the term [...] "War on Drugs," [...] as he claims it is counter-productive and {{is contrary to the}} policy favoring treatment over incarceration in trying to reduce drug use. [...] "Being smart about drugs means working to treat people who go to jail with a drug problem so <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and return to the communities you protect, you will be less likely to re-arrest them".|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of prison, the Masters of Menace {{agree to}} rejoin the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. They try to hypnotize Avengers' members Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch into joining them but fail. Princess Python fights hand-to-hand with the Scarlet Witch after trying to cover her eyes, but loses when the Witch uses her hex power to soak her down with water, {{preventing}} her whistling for her pet. The Circus of Crime does escape capture, however, though it is later mentioned the D.A. [...] "wormed the truth out of Princess Python".|$|E
50|$|While {{in prison}} Stander meets two other men, Lee McCall and Allan Heyl, {{with whom he}} quickly fosters a friendship. The trio have grand plans of {{what they will do}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> even saying that when they do they will come back for each other. After a year or so in prison Stander and McCall go to play a rugby game with other prisoners. During the game they feign serious injury and are taken to the infirmary, where they knock the doctor {{unconscious}} and relieve the guards of their weapons. Shortly after their escape Stander and McCall return for Heyl, the three introduce themselves to each other as their new assumed names and proceed to rob a few banks, purchase a high-priced safehouse, and steal a yellow Porsche 911 Targa.|$|E

5000|$|Young children, elderly adults, or {{disabled}} individuals {{left alone in}} a vehicle are at particular risk of succumbing to heat stroke. [...] "Heat stroke in children and in the elderly can occur within minutes, even if a car window is opened slightly." [...] As these groups of individuals {{may not be able}} to open car doors or to express discomfort verbally (or audibly, inside a closed car), their plight may not be immediately noticed by others in the vicinity. It is recommended that parents put their purse, wallet, or anything that is valuable in the backseat so that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their items <b>out</b> of the backseat they can see that their child is there as well. For larger groups in a van or bus, checking for stragglers at the end of the trip is essential, complemented by other procedures such as a head count.|$|R
60|$|But, honestly, I {{think an}} {{umbrella}} is a nuisance any where when its {{business is to}} keep the sun off. No Arab wears a brim to his fez, or uses an umbrella, or any thing to shade his eyes or his face, and he always looks comfortable and proper in the sun. But of all the ridiculous sights I ever have seen, our party of eight is the most so --they do cut such an outlandish figure. They travel single file; they all wear the endless white rag of Constantinople wrapped round and round their hats and dangling down their backs; they all wear thick green spectacles, with side-glasses to them; they all hold white umbrellas, lined with green, over their heads; without exception their stirrups are too short--they are the very worst gang of horsemen on earth, their animals to a horse trot fearfully hard--and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> strung <b>out</b> one after the other; glaring straight ahead and breathless; bouncing high and out of turn, all along the line; knees well up and stiff, elbows flapping like a rooster's that is going to crow, and the long file of umbrellas popping convulsively up and down--when one sees this outrageous picture exposed to the light of day, he is amazed that the gods don't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> their thunderbolts and destroy them {{off the face of the}} earth! I do--I wonder at it. I wouldn't let any such caravan go through a country of mine.|$|R

He and his henchperson escape and lock the Baudelaire Orphans and Mr. Poe in the gate of the house, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the gate the convicts have already escaped, leaving Mr. Poe to look for a new guardian for the Baudelaires.|$|E
50|$|While researching, Durkin became {{fascinated by}} how someone {{gets into the}} farm or commune or group, and made a short film of the name Mary Last Seen about it {{starring}} Brady Corbet, who plays cult recruiter Watts in both the short and feature films. Mary Last Seen won the award for best short film at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight. While Mary Last Seen was about how someone gets into the cult, Martha Marcy May Marlene was {{about what happens to}} someone <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it. Durkin made the short to show the world Martha was in, and also with the intent to send it out with the script for Martha Marcy May Marlene to potential investors. The short film Mary Last Seen was selected for the Sundance Film Festival, and Durkin was given a distribution deal with Fox Searchlight.|$|E
5000|$|Its pit {{facilities}} have {{easy access to}} the Jagorawi Toll Road. The current circuit is a truncated version of the original design. Approximately 40% shorter than the original, the circuit runs clockwise and is predominantly used for motorcycle racing and the Asian F3 series. Sentul is a relatively simple, smooth, broad track with large runoff areas, enabling non-bumpy and smooth driving at racing speeds. Sentul has a 900 m main straight that allows speeds of up to 300 km/h before slowing for the right-hand Turn 1. The only truly high-speed corner at Sentul is Turn 2. The fastest driver on four-wheel machines can do 220 km/h, and the fastest rider can do 190 km/h on two-wheel machines. They can take Turn 2 as a complex [...] "S" [...] bend <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> from the tighter Turn 1 at around 140 km/h. The wide corners allow good passing with various racing lines.|$|E
60|$|He asked {{permission}} to send parties {{outside of the}} lines to bury his dead, who had fallen on the 15th <b>when</b> <b>they</b> tried to <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> I gave directions that his permit to pass our limits should be recognized. I {{have no reason to}} believe that this privilege was abused, but it familiarized our guards so much with the sight of Confederates passing to and fro that I have no doubt many got beyond our pickets unobserved and went on. The most of the men who went in that way no doubt thought they had had war enough, and left with the intention of remaining out of the army. Some came to me and asked {{permission to}} go, saying that they were tired of the war and would not be caught in the ranks again, and I bade them go.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{altogether}} {{unfit to}} make a plan, and still more unfit to carry it out," [...] he said, [...] "but my idea would certainly be to attack somewhere with half my force, to force the enemy back, and to hold positions {{at the end of}} the day, so that the Germans would concentrate to attack in the morning. At night I would withdraw the greater portion of them, march them straight across Paris; the other half of the army would attack there at daybreak, and would be reinforced soon after the fighting began by those who had fought the day before. I think in that way they ought to be able to cut their way out, but what <b>they</b> would do <b>when</b> <b>they</b> once <b>get</b> <b>out</b> is more than I can tell you. They have no cavalry to speak of, while the Germans have a splendid cavalry force who would harass them continually. The infantry would pursue and would march infinitely better than we should do. We should scatter to get food, whole regiments would break up and become masses of fugitives, and finally we should be surrounded, either cut to pieces or forced to surrender. Of two things, I am not sure that it would not be best for us to be handsomely thrashed on the first day of our sortie." ...|$|R

Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone.
