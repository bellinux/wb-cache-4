On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
25|$|The State Senate {{had been}} {{controlled}} by Republicans since 1964, but Democrats {{were able to}} win {{a majority in the}} 2008 elections.

As they {{reduce the size of}} their balance sheet and deleverage, they are reducing not just the size of their assets but the size of their liabilities. Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits.

25|$|Lee was {{not able}} to attend the review, however, so it was {{repeated}} in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations. Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired with brake failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E
25|$|John Hales wrote {{a speech}} to give in the House of Commons in 1563; he was a {{partisan}} of the Earl of Hertford, in right of his wife, the former Lady Catherine Grey. It {{was related to the}} efforts of Lord John Grey, Lady Catherine Grey's uncle and guardian, who tried {{to make the case that}} she was the royal heir at an early point in Elizabeth's reign, incurring the Queen's wrath. This manuscript brought to bear on the question the old statute De natis ultra mare. It was influential in the following debate, but the interpretation of the statute became important. It also caused a furore, and allegations of a plot. Hales could only be brought to say that he had shown a draft to John Grey, William Fleetwood, the other member of parliament for the same borough, and John Foster, who had been one of the members for Hindon. Walter Haddon called Hales's arrest and the subsequent row the Tempestas Halesiana. What Hales <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> quite complex, using legal arguments to rule out Scottish claimants, and also relying on research abroad by Robert Beale to reopen the matter of the Hertford marriage. Francis Newdigate, who had married Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, was involved in the investigation, but was not imprisoned; Hales was. He spent a year in the Fleet Prison and the Tower of London, and for the rest of his life was under house arrest.|$|E

Hsu was still contesting the charges of campaign finance fraud, however.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, that what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E

Cloverfield director Matt Reeves noted they hired Page to design the [...] "creature" [...] that appears in the film, commenting, [...] "We would go into his office and he would have what I affectionately referred to as his 'Wall of Terror.' On the wall were all sorts of bits of color, and as you got closer suddenly your interest turned to revulsion because those pictures were like pictures of intestines and eyeballs and pieces of animals.

The team developed him as a nuanced character, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward hero or villain, in order to provide an interesting experience. Wiethoff considered Marston to be very determined about his goals. [...] "He was a man about things," [...] Wiethoff remarked. Technical director Ted Carson felt that Marston became interesting due to the combination of cynicism and realism. Wiethoff felt that Marston was aware that his past actions were [...] "wrong", resulting in his attempt to abandon his former life. He stated that Marston's early decisions in his life were a direct result of his need for acceptance. [...] "I don't know if he knew that what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong or not," [...] Wiethoff said.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell that what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, he is likely to be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion as to what to do.|$|E
500|$|Donen is {{credited}} with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals [...] such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley [...] were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers {{were part of a}} stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch... What we did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal." [...] Film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical [...] "outshines anybody else's, including Vincente Minnelli's." [...] He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
500|$|California {{used the}} M'Naghten {{standard}} for sanity which held {{that for a}} defendant to [...] "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of}} the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts were wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the co-eds because he wanted them [...] "for myself, like possessions," [...] and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind.|$|E

500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, {{that he did not know}} what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of Automatism where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong".|$|E
