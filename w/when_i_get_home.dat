It's all different". Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: [...] "I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>home</b> and work it out on guitar or piano".|$|E

On 22 June 1897, Townshend wrote in his diary in his post in the Sudan:The letter of the Comtesse D’Anvers is the sweetest I have ever had in my life. She writes as a mother to me.

60|$|We did not buy any wooden {{images of}} the Lion, nor any ivory or ebony or marble or chalk or sugar or {{chocolate}} ones, or even any photographic slanders of him. The truth is, these copies were so common, so universal, in the shops and everywhere, that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually becomes to the harassed ear. In Lucerne, too, the wood carvings of other sorts, which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home, soon began to fatigue us. We grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around clock-faces, and still more tired of seeing wooden {{images of the}} alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks, or lying upon them in family groups, or peering alertly up from behind them.

To the Bryant Service Club: Yesterday, 17 January, I {{was pleasantly}} {{surprised}} to receive a lovely box of candy from you and I do want to express my sincere thanks {{as well as my}} sincere appreciation for the thoughtfulness of the Club in remembering me. It seems a long time since I last heard from the Bryant Service Club and I guess the last time that I did I was back in the States. Since leaving the United States, I was stationed in England for a period of about five months and saw {{a great deal of the}} English countryside. We were stationed in a place called Woolacombe, which was in a great many respects a replica of Narragansett Pier. the weather there, even in the summertime was quite cold and on days when we thought it was cold, the folks living there were in bathing, so it seems they are more hardened to cold weather than we are back home. I have been in France for the last four months and have seen a great many parts of this country. It is very interesting to see the sights and customs of the folks over here and <b>I</b> hope that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back <b>home</b> to have a little opportunity to drop over to see the members of the Brynat [sic] Club and tell them some of the things which I am sure will be of interest to them. I hope that if the Club issues any data on former members of the college that they will place me on the mailing list for I would appreciate hearing of and reading about the members who are in the Service.

You have been so incredibly supportive during this long journey. From the little things (rides to and from campus, preparing dinner for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was late <b>getting</b> <b>home)</b> to the big things (financial, mental, and emotional support), you were there with me the whole time and I am so very grateful.

6000|$|What is {{the meaning}} of all these wars and rumours of wars? No [...] respectable person ever seems to occupy himself with the question, [...] but I can't help feeling it more {{interesting}} than anything in Homer [...] or Plato or the gallery of the Vatican. I long daily with [...] unappeasable longing for a righteous life, such a life as I am sure [...] is implied in every human possibility, and myriads are bearing me [...] company. What does this show but that the issue is near out of all [...] our existing chaos? All our evil is fossil and comes from the mere [...] persistence of diseased institutions in pretending to rule us when [...] we ought to be left free to be living spirits of God. There is no [...] fresh evil in the world. No one now steals or commits murder or [...] any other offence with the least relish for it, but only to revenge [...] his poor starved opportunities. The superiority of America in [...] respect to freedom of thought over Europe comes from this fact that [...] she has so nearly achieved her deliverance from such tyrannies. All [...] she now needs to make her right is simply an intelligent [...] recognition of her spiritual whereabouts. If she had this she would [...] put her hand to the work splendidly. You and <b>I</b> <b>when</b> we <b>get</b> <b>home</b> [...] will try to quicken her intelligence in that respect, will do at [...] any rate our best to put away this pestilent munching of the tree [...] of knowledge of good and evil, and persuade to the belief of man's [...] unmixed innocence.|$|R

Dear Friends, I just {{received}} your swell Christmas package yesterday, and I {{want to take}} time out {{and thank you for}} it. It was certainly very nice, and I appreciate it very much. Well, things are just about the same with me as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last wrote to you. Of course that was around a year ago, but believe me things are still just about the same. I am now Post Sergeant Major of Camp Amirabad, which is located just outside of Teheran, which as you know, is the capital of Iran. We are really kept pretty busy, but I would rather have it that way, as the time seems to go by quite a bit faster when you are working hard all the time. It has been some time since I have heard any news of Bryant, but from what I understand, there aren’t many of the group left that were there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in attendance. By that I of course mean the instructors. I guess things have changed everywhere. It has been over two years since I last was back in the States, and I will probably not recognize the place <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finally do <b>get</b> <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> suppose they still keep you pretty busy in the classrooms. That was one place that made me study to get through. If any of the old group of instructors are still around I would appreciate it if you would give my regards to them. Well, I must close for now, as it is about time for me to be heading back to the barracks, and to bed. I want to thank you again for remembering me with the gift. I also want to extend the thanks of my barracks mates who helped me eat the contents. Sincerely Robert T. ClarkRobert T. Clark, 31057032 Technical Sergeant. [Transcription ends...|$|R
