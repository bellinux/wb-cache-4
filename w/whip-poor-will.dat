25|$|Creating young-forest {{habitat for}} American {{woodcock}} helps more than 50 {{other species of}} wildlife that need early successional habitat during part or all of their life cycles. These include relatively common animals such as white-tailed deer, snowshoe hare, moose, bobcat, wild turkey, and ruffed grouse, and animals whose populations have also declined in recent decades, such as the golden-winged warbler, <b>whip-poor-will,</b> willow flycatcher, indigo bunting, and New England cottontail.|$|E
500|$|Chapters 4 and 5 {{illustrate}} more [...] "picture-patterns" [...] in well camouflaged birds including Wilson's snipe and <b>whip-poor-will</b> (nighthawks and goatsuckers, Caprimulgidae). Thayer describes {{these as}} showing [...] "obliteration, or merging with the background" [...] but that their patterning {{is close to}} mimicry as they [...] "perfectly" [...] resemble objects such as [...] "a stone or mossy log".|$|E
500|$|As an International Bird Area, Quehanna's {{forests are}} {{recognized}} as a [...] "large, unfragmented tract with exceptional diversity of woodland species" [...] and are home to 102species of birds. Common birds include American crow, black-capped chickadee, blue jay, broad-winged hawk, common raven, hermit thrush, house sparrow, northern waterthrush, starling, <b>whip-poor-will,</b> and wild turkey. Quehanna Wild Area includes a variety of forest, riparian, and wetland habitats that support a diversity of animals. The shrub and scrubland areas left by the 1985 tornado and cleared for elk to feed in are home to indigo bunting and prairie warbler, while ponds and wetlands attract waterfowl such as hooded merganser and wood duck, and wading birds like great blue heron. The birch forest of Marion Brooks Natural Area is home to downy, hairy, and pileated woodpeckers, the oak forest of Wykoff Run Natural Area has black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, and white-breasted nuthatch, and its aspen groves have woodcock. In addition to the commonly seen red-tailed hawk, other raptors include the northern goshawk and the golden and bald eagles.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{birds that}} have obvious [...] "whiskers" [...] are flycatchers, swallows, nightjars, <b>whip-poor-wills,</b> the kakapo and the long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi).|$|R
50|$|Eastern <b>whip-poor-wills</b> {{breed in}} {{deciduous}} or mixed woods across central and southeastern Canada {{and the eastern}} United States, and migrate to the southeastern United States and to eastern Mexico and Central America for the winter. These birds forage at night, catching insects in flight, and normally sleep during the day. Eastern <b>whip-poor-wills</b> nest on the ground, in shaded locations among dead leaves, and usually lay two eggs at a time. The bird will commonly remain on the nest unless almost stepped upon.|$|R
6000|$|... * The <b>whip-poor-will</b> is a bird {{which is}} only heard at night. It {{receives}} its name from its note, which is thought to resemble those words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Jenny Wren," [...] said Peter very humbly. [...] "Of course <b>Whip-poor-will</b> has {{whiskers}} {{if you say}} so. By the way, do the Whip-poor-wills do any better {{in the matter of}} a nest than the Nighthawks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody {{asked you}} to swallow them. Nobody wants you to swallow them," [...] snapped Jenny. [...] "I don't know why a bird shouldn't have {{whiskers}} {{just as well as}} you, Peter Rabbit. Anyway, <b>Whip-poor-will</b> has them and that is all there is to it. It doesn't make any difference whether you believe in them or not, they are there. And I guess <b>Whip-poor-will</b> finds them just as useful as you find yours, and a little more so. I know this much, that if I had to catch all my food in the air I'd want whiskers and lots of them so that the insects would get tangled in them. I suppose that's what Whip-poor-will's are for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you noticed}} that much, did you?" [...] cried Jenny. [...] "It does you credit, Peter. It does you credit. I {{wonder if you}} also noticed <b>Whip-poor-will's</b> whiskers." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{frequently}} {{used as an}} auditory symbol of rural America, as in Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, or as a plot device. For example, William Faulkner's short story, [...] "Barn Burning", makes several mentions of <b>whip-poor-wills,</b> e.g.: [...] "and then he found {{that he had been}} asleep because he knew it was almost dawn, the night almost over. He could tell that from the <b>whip-poor-wills.</b> They were everywhere now among the dark trees below him, constant and inflectioned and ceaseless, so that, as the instant for giving over to the day birds drew nearer and nearer, there was no interval at all between them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} tune [...] "My Blue Heaven", {{written in}} 1924 by Walter Donaldson and George A. Whiting, and popularized by a 1928 Gene Austin recording, opens with the words, [...] "When <b>whip-poor-wills</b> call, and evening is nigh, I hurry to my blue heaven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] replied Jenny Wren. [...] "Mrs. <b>Whip-poor-will</b> lays {{her eggs}} {{right on the}} ground, but usually in the Green Forest where it is dark and lonesome. Like Mrs. Nighthawk, she lays only two. It's {{the same way with}} another second cousin, Chuck-will's-widow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is a sort}} {{of second}} cousin, the same as Sooty the Chimney Swift," [...] {{explained}} Jenny Wren. [...] "They look enough alike to be own cousins. <b>Whip-poor-will</b> has just the same kind of a big mouth and he is dressed very much like Boomer, save that there are no white patches on his wings." ...|$|E

60|$|Now broke {{forth from}} the shores the notes of an innumerable variety of insects, which filled {{the air with a}} strange but not inharmonious concert; while ever and anon was heard the melancholy plaint of the <b>whip-poor-will,</b> who, perched on some lone tree, wearied the ear of night with his incessant moanings. The mind, soothed into a hallowed melancholy, listened with pensive stillness to catch and {{distinguish}} each sound that vaguely echoed from the shore--now and then startled, perchance, by the whoop of some straggling savage, or by the dreary howl of a wolf, stealing forth upon his nightly prowlings.|$|E
60|$|It was night. All {{the little}} stars were looking down and {{twinkling}} and twinkling. Mother Moon was doing {{her best to}} make the Green Meadows as light as Mr. Sun did in the daytime. All the little birds except Hooty the Owl and Boomer the Night Hawk, and noisy Mr. <b>Whip-poor-will</b> were fast asleep in their little nests. Old Mother West Wind's Merry Little Breezes had all gone to sleep, too. It was oh so still! Indeed it was so very still that Bobby Coon, coming down the Lone Little Path through the wood, began to talk to himself.|$|E
6000|$|I {{became an}} oracle among my schoolmates {{on account of}} my {{superior}} erudition, and soon imparted to them the contagion of my infected fancy.

Then came the perilous journey homeward. What delight we would take in getting up wanton panics in some dusky part of the wood; scampering like frightened deer; pausing to take breath; renewing the panic, and scampering off again, wild with fictitious terror! ...|$|E

6000|$|Most of Peter's {{feathered}} {{friends had}} settled {{themselves for the}} coming night, the worries and cares of the day over and forgotten. All the Great World seemed hushed.

60|$|THE MOON.--May 18.--I went to {{bed early}} last night, but found myself waked shortly after 12, and, turning awhile, sleepless and mentally feverish, I rose, dress'd myself, sallied forth and walk'd down the lane. The full moon, some {{three or four hours}} up--a {{sprinkle}} of light and less-light clouds just lazily moving--Jupiter an hour high in the east, and here and there throughout the heavens a random star appearing and disappearing. So beautifully veiled and varied--the air, with that early-summer perfume, not at all damp or raw--at times Luna languidly emerging in richest brightness for minutes, and then partially envelop'd again. Far off a poor <b>whip-poor-will</b> plied his notes incessantly. It was that silent time between 1 and 3.|$|E
60|$|The early hour, {{the gait}} {{at which the}} {{stranger}} urged his horse, {{the manner in which}} he passed the open and inviting door of the <b>Whip-Poor-Will,</b> proclaimed him a messenger, who probably bore some communication of importance from the Government of the Colony to the younger Heathcote, who filled the highest station of official authority in that distant settlement. Observations to this purport had passed from mouth to mouth, and curiosity was actively alive, by the time the horseman rode into the court. There he dismounted, and, covered with the dust of the road, he presented himself, with the air of one who had passed the night in the saddle, before the man he sought.|$|E
