5|$|Volume II covers an {{assortment}} of topics: animals including sea creatures such as sea urchin, seahorse, <b>whelk,</b> mussel, crab, scorpion, electric ray, viper, cuttlefish and many others; dairy produce; cereals; vegetables such as sea kale, beetroot, asparagus; and sharp herbs such as garlic, leek, onion, caper and mustard.|$|E
5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, flatfishes, and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark. It also consumes crustaceans, in particular crabs but also hermit crabs and large shrimp, and cephalopods. Given the opportunity, this shark will scavenge. Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods, and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the copepod Lernaeopoda galei. The netted dog <b>whelk</b> (Nassarius reticulatus) preys on the nursehound's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk.|$|E
5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed <b>whelk</b> (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled <b>whelk</b> (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were present}} in lower Florida 10,000years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was {{comparatively}} empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just {{to the west of}} the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500years before the present, with piles of conch and <b>whelk</b> shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.|$|E

However, NIFES found that in blue mussel the {{concentration}} of cadmium was higher than normal, and in <b>whelk</b> it was between two and three times higher than levels normally found on the Norwegian coast. NIFES found also that <b>whelk</b> accumulate cadmium more than do mussel.|$|E

25|$|Publication of the decades-long Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology is a work-in-progress; and {{therefore}} {{it is not yet}} complete: For example, there is no volume yet published regarding the post-Paleozoic era caenogastropods (a molluscan group including the <b>whelk</b> and periwinkle). Furthermore, every so often, previously published volumes of the Treatise are revised.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} {{polymorphic}} for different chromosome structural forms. The structural variation {{may be associated}} with different numbers of chromosomes in different individuals, which occurs in the ladybird beetle Chilocorus stigma, some mantids of the genus Ameles, the European shrew Sorex araneus. There is some evidence from the case of the mollusc Thais lapillus (the dog <b>whelk)</b> on the Brittany coast, that the two chromosome morphs are adapted to different habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of TBT and other tin-based anti-fouling coatings on marine vessels {{was a major}} environmental problem. TBT {{has been shown to}} harm many marine organisms, specifically oysters and mollusks. Extremely low concentrations of tributyltin moiety (TBT) causes defective shell growth in the oyster Crassostrea gigas (at a concentration of 20ng/l) and development of male characteristics in female genitalia in the dog <b>whelk</b> Nucella lapillus (where gonocharacteristic change is initiated at 1ng/l).|$|E

5000|$|True <b>whelks</b> are carnivorous, {{feeding on}} worms, crustaceans, mussels and other molluscs, {{drilling}} holes through shells {{to gain access}} to the soft tissues. <b>Whelks</b> use chemoreceptors to locate their prey.|$|R
25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle {{on one side and}} a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the <b>whelk</b> shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and <b>whelk</b> shells.|$|E
25|$|Cahokia {{became the}} most {{important}} center for the peoples known today as Mississippians. Their settlements ranged across {{what is now the}} Midwest, Eastern, and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the Great Lakes to the north and the Gulf Coast to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, Mill Creek chert, and <b>whelk</b> shells.|$|E
25|$|The Nodena Phase is {{an archaeological}} phase in eastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri of the Late Mississippian culture which dates from about 14001650 CE. The Nodena Phase is known from a {{collection}} of villages along the Mississippi River between the Missouri Bootheel and Wapanocca Lake. They practiced extensive maize agriculture and artificial cranial deformation and were members of a continent wide trade and religious network known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, which brought chert, <b>whelk</b> shells, and other exotic goods to the area.|$|E
5000|$|The Busyconidae are taxonomic {{family of}} large sea snails, often known as <b>whelks</b> or true <b>whelks.</b> [...] "True whelk" [...] also refers to Buccinidae. Busyconidae {{consists}} of Recent and fossil species.|$|R
40|$|Although {{invasive}} species often resemble their native counterparts, {{differences in their}} foraging and anti-predator strategies may disrupt native food webs. In a California estuary, we showed that regions dominated by native crabs and native <b>whelks</b> have low mortality of native oysters (the basal prey), while regions dominated by invasive crabs and invasive <b>whelks</b> have high oyster mortality and are consequently losing a biologically diverse habitat. Using field experiments, we demonstrated that the invasive <b>whelk’s</b> distribution is causally related to a large-scale pattern of oyster mortality. To determine whether predator–prey interactions between crabs (top predators) and <b>whelks</b> (intermediate consumers) indirectly control the pattern of oyster mortality, we manipulated the presence and invasion status of the intermediate and top trophic levels in laboratory mesocosms. Our results show that native crabs indirectly maintain {{a portion of the}} estuary’s oyster habitat by both consuming native <b>whelks</b> (density-mediated trophic cascade) and altering their foraging behavior (trait-mediated trophic cascade). In contrast, invasive <b>whelks</b> are naive to crab predators and fail to avoid them, thereby inhibiting trait-mediated cascades and their invasion into areas with native crabs. Similarly, when native crabs are replaced with invasive crabs, the naive foraging strategy and smaller size of invasive crabs prevents them from efficiently consuming adult <b>whelks,</b> thereby inhibiting strong density-mediated cascades. Thus, while trophic cascades allow native crabs, <b>whelks,</b> and oysters to locally co-exist, the replacement of native crabs and <b>whelks</b> by functionally similar {{invasive species}} results in severe depletion of native oysters. As coastal systems become increasingly invaded, the mismatch of evolutionarily based strategies among predators and prey may lead to further losses of critical habitat that support marine biodiversity and ecosystem function...|$|R
50|$|This {{superfamily}} {{includes the}} murex snails, the chank snails, the true <b>whelks,</b> the dove snails, the crown conchs and busycon <b>whelks,</b> the spindle and tulip snails, the volutes and olives, the harp snails, the margin snails, the miters, and others.|$|R
25|$|Many {{other species}} {{worldwide}} {{within the family}} Muricidae, for example Plicopurpura pansa, from the tropical eastern Pacific, and Plicopurpura patula from the Caribbean zone of the western Atlantic, can also produce a similar substance (which turns into an enduring purple dye when exposed to sunlight) and this ability has sometimes also been historically exploited by local inhabitants in the areas where these snails occur (Some other predatory gastropods, such as some wentletraps in the family Epitoniidae, seem to also produce a similar substance, although {{this has not been}} studied or exploited commercially). The dog <b>whelk</b> Nucella lapillus, from the North Atlantic, {{can also be used to}} produce red-purple and violet dyes.|$|E
25|$|Predators of Semibalanus balanoides {{include the}} <b>whelk</b> Nucella lapillus, the shanny Lipophrys pholis, the sea star Asterias vulgaris, and nudibranchs. Although {{they have no}} eyes, {{barnacles}} are aware of changes in light, and withdraw into their shells when threatened. Parasites of S. balanus include Pyxinoides balani, a protozoan which lives in the barnacle's midgut, and Epistylis horizontalis, a ciliate which lives on the gills. The isopod Hemioniscus balani occurs from France to the Faroe Islands and the Oslofjord, and from Labrador to Massachusetts, and is a parasite of S. balanoides, effectively castrating the barnacle if it is heavily infested. The lichens Arthropyrenia sublittoralis and Pyrenocollema halodytes may colonise the shells of barnacles.|$|E
25|$|Species {{other than}} blue crab are often caught {{incidentally}} in crab pots, including fish, turtles, conch, and other crab species. In Georgia, hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), channeled <b>whelk</b> (Busycon canaliculatum), spider crabs (Libinia spp.), and stone crabs (Menippe mercenaria) {{were the most}} common species observed as bycatch in commercial crab pots. Of important concern is the diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin. The blue crab and diamondback terrapin have overlapping ranges along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States. Because the funnels in a crab pot are flexible, small terrapins may easily enter and become entrapped. Traps are checked every 24 hours or less, frequently resulting in drowning and death of terrapins. Crab pot bycatch may reduce local terrapin populations to less than half. To reduce terrapin entrapment, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) may be installed {{on each of the}} funnels in a crab pot. BRDs effectively reduce bycatch (and subsequently mortality) of small terrapins without affecting blue crab catch.|$|E
5000|$|Busycon is a genus of {{very large}} edible sea snails, marine {{gastropod}} mollusks {{in the family}} Busyconidae. These snails are commonly known in the United States as <b>whelks</b> or Busycon <b>whelks.</b> Less commonly they are loosely, and somewhat misleadingly, called [...] "conchs".|$|R
50|$|True <b>whelks</b> are {{carnivores}} and scavengers. They feed on clams, carrion, {{and sometimes}} even on detritus. Their sense of smell is very well-developed; they can sense chemical signals from their prey from a considerable distance with their osphradia. Many <b>whelks</b> are capable of boring through the shell of bivalves, and because of this, some species cause much harm in oyster farms. True <b>whelks</b> can even attack fish caught in a net by extending their probosces to twice the length of their own bodies.|$|R
