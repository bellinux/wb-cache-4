His mind, heart, and his uniquely Irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace...His wonderful <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of his fellow Irish Nobel Prize winners Shaw, Yeats, and Beckett, will be a lasting gift for all the world.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians {{have sought}} to retroactively judge Israeli actions in the 1940s under new norms {{developing}} {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries. But international law does not <b>work</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law goes something like this: even if (or assuming that) the Israelis did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it almost certainly would be if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E

25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} {{one of two}} types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne <b>works</b> <b>like</b> the one in a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|R
50|$|Racism {{remained}} a key subject in literature throughout the early seventies. While Madison Jones' A Cry of Absence and Ernest J. Gaines' The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman studied {{racism in the}} past, <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Nadine Gordimer and Bernard Malamud studied race relations in South Africa and New York respectively.|$|R

2500|$|Tezuka {{is known}} for his imaginative stories and stylized Japanese adaptations of western {{literature}} with reading novels and watching films that came from the West. His early works included manga versions of Disney movies such as Bambi. Tezuka's [...] "cinematic" [...] page layouts, influenced by Milt Gross' early graphic novel He Done Her Wrong, which he read as a child, became a common characteristic for many manga artists who followed in Tezuka's footsteps. His <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of other manga creators, was sometimes gritty and violent.|$|E
2500|$|Hargrave's work {{inspired}} Alexander Graham Bell {{to begin}} his own experiments {{with a series of}} tetrahedral kite designs. However, Hargrave's <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of many another pioneer, was not sufficiently appreciated during his lifetime. His models were offered to the premier of New South Wales as a gift to the state, and it is generally incorrectly stated that the offer was not accepted. It is not clear what really happened, but there appears to have been delays in accepting the models, and in the meantime they were given to some visiting German professors who handed them to the Munich museum. Hargrave also conducted experiments with a hydroplane, the application of the gyroscopic principle to a [...] "one-wheeled car", and with 'wave propelled vessels'.|$|E

[...] Armstrong confirmed the story. On the main evening news on TF1, a French national television station, Armstrong said: [...] "His accusations aren't good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody. If he thinks cycling <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> he's wrong and he would be better off going home." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ethologists {{and others}} {{writing in the}} 1960s and 1970s {{questioned}} the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults. Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, <b>work</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> just described led {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists [...] "are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Mizoguchi's <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of his {{contemporary}} Yasujirō Ozu, was regarded by Japanese audiences as somewhat old-fashioned and dated. He was rediscovered, however, in the West - and particularly by Cahiers du cinéma critics such as Jacques Rivette. After a phase inspired by Japanese women's suffrage, which produced radical films like Victory of the Women (1946) and My Love Has Been Burning (1949), Mizoguchi {{took a turn}} to the jidai-geki — or period drama, re-made from stories from Japanese folklore or period history — together with long-time screenwriter and collaborator Yoshikata Yoda. It was to be his most celebrated series of works, including The Life of Oharu (1952), which won him international recognition and which he considered his best film, and Ugetsu (1953), which won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Sansho the Bailiff (1954) reworks a premise from feudal Japan (and the short story by Mori Ōgai). Of his nearly 80 films, only two [...] Tales of the Taira Clan (1955) and Princess Yang Kwei-Fei (1955) [...] were made in colour.|$|E
2500|$|Poet and {{cultural}} critic Wayne Koestenbaum criticizes Brown for affirming the anus as [...] "a bodily and symbolic zone" [...] while ignoring its connection to sodomy and homosexual desire. Koestenbaum, unlike Brown, believes that to privilege the anus is to [...] "admit {{the desirability of}} male homosexual relations." [...] Cultural historian Richard Webster finds Life Against Death {{to be similar to}} Erik Erikson's Young Man Luther (1958) in that it suggests similarities between Lutheran Protestantism and classical psychoanalysis. Webster believes that the resemblances are scarcely disputable. However, he writes that while Protestants may be comforted by the discovery that the revealed truths perceived by Luther are in harmony with Freud's hypotheses, others may regard such a [...] "congruence of ancient faith and modern reason" [...] with scepticism and [...] "ask to what extent we should regard psychoanalysis not as a scientific approach to human nature but as a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition." [...] Webster describes Brown's <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Marcuse, Jacques Lacan, and several other modern thinkers, as [...] "a doomed and tragic attempt to reconstruct {{at the level of the}} intellect a sensual identity which has been crucified at the level of the spontaneous and vital body." [...] Historian Arthur Marwick dismissed Life Against Death as, [...] "a curious ragbag of quotations". Author Jay Cantor described Brown's Life Against Death and Marcuse's Eros and Civilization as [...] "equally profound".|$|E
50|$|De Camp's work {{is still}} one of the most {{reliable}} sources on the lost continent theme. Lost continents or ancient civilizations sunk by a deluge are a common theme in the scriptures of doctrines of many modern pseudoreligions or cults. Well-known instances include James Churchward's books on Mu, or the Theosopical portrayals of Hyperborea, Lemuria and Atlantis, and even the Nazi mythologizing about Thule. As authors of these materials tend not to state (or mis-state) their sources, <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of de Camp are quite useful to anyone interested in objective information.|$|R
50|$|I've {{wondered}} about that. This {{is going to}} sound bizarre to most people, but ALL inspiration comes from something similar to the way a radio works. If you imagine that everything ever known or will be known exists between the lowest and the highest frequencies, we simply either stumble upon a brilliant song accidentally, or we spend our lives searching for great songs and find them where we may. Invention <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I think Tesla said something to that effect: We are simply filters for Divine Knowledge.|$|R

Sursok received the role of Dani, the eldest daughter of the Sutherland family, {{who took over the}} running of the Caravan Park. The actress considered herself lucky to get the part, calling the experience [...] "incredible". [...] She told a writer for TeenHollywood, [...] "It was my first audition, so I thought it always <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and you always get your first audition, {{but that is not the}} case." ...|$|R
2500|$|Musically, {{the wind}} quintets {{represent}} {{a more conservative}} trend in Reicha's oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. [...] In the quintets, as he describes in his Preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, 'un-rationalised' flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys) and thereby the ambitions of amateur wind players by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial <b>work</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). [...] His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life – many marches and 'walking' themes and, {{in the last two}} quintets, fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. [...] Four of the quintets have Trios in Passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. Berlioz says the quintets [...] "enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold", while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all, but excelling in the Minuets where this charge does not apply. Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): [...] ", the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer's intention" [...] (p. 56); of 's cor anglais playing he says (p. 23) [...] "However remarkable the singer...I {{find it hard to believe}} she can ever have made it sound as natural and touching as it did on Vogt's instrument".|$|E

Using the white-line woodblock technique, she created prints of women sunbathing at the beach, The Ball Game (1934), factories, and neighbors with gable-roofed house that reflect her {{interest}} in modernism in the slightly abstract forms. Her works reflect influence of 19th-century Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, her study with Lazzell, and French <b>works,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Paul Gauguin and Maurice Denis.

Kimmage, a professional cyclist in the 1980s who later became a sports journalist, referred to Armstrong as a [...] "cancer in cycling". He also asked Armstrong questions in relation to his [...] "admiration for dopers" [...] at a press conference at the Tour of California in 2009, provoking a scathing reaction from Armstrong.
