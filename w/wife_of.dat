40|$|The {{impacts of}} the Vietnam War on many <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Australian and South Vietnamese {{veterans}} are profound and permanent. Social histories have largely neglected these impacts on women, focussing instead on the {{impacts of the}} war on Australian male Vietnam veterans. This article argues that the impacts on <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Australian and South Vietnamese veterans should be recognised as a cost of the war and that <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> veterans from both countries deserve a place in history. To support this argument, this article uses spoken and written narratives <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Australian and South Vietnamese veterans. The evidence from these narratives contributes to the existing body of knowledge about the impacts of the war and also gives a voice to <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> veterans from both countries. The article compares and contrasts the experiences described in the narratives <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Australian Vietnam veterans changed by war with the experiences <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnamese veterans affected by war and imprisonment...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Wives of {{pathological}} gamblers tend {{to endure}} long marriages despite financial and emotional burden. Difficulties in social adjustment, personality psychopathology, and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders are pointed as reasons for remaining on such overwhelming relationships. The {{goal was to}} examine the social adjustment, personality and negative emotionality <b>of</b> <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers. Method: The sample consisted <b>of</b> 25 <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers, mean age 40. 6, SD = 9. 1 from a Gambling Outpatient Unit and at GAM-ANON, and 25 <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> non-gamblers, mean age 40. 8, SD = 9. 1, who answered advertisements placed at the Universidade de São Paulo hospital and medical school complex. They were selected in order to approximately match demographic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers. Subjects were assessed by the Social Adjustment Scale, Temperament and Character Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Three variables remained in the final Multiple Logistic Regression model, <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers presented greater dissatisfaction with their marital bond, and higher scores on Reward Dependence and Persistence temperament factors. Both, Wives of pathological gamblers and <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> non-gamblers presented well-structured character factors excluding personality disorders. Conclusion: This personality profile may explain <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers emotional resilience and their marriage longevity. Co-dependence and other labels previously used to describe them may work as a double edged sword, legitimating <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> pathological gamblers problems, while stigmatizing them as inapt and needy...|$|R
