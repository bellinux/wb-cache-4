6000|$|She {{was silent}} a moment, {{and then she}} demanded: [...] "Why didn't <b>you</b> tell me <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were?</b> <b>You</b> let me think, when I met you in Silliston that day, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a carpenter. I didn't know you'd written books." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{was a time}} in my {{life when}} I wasn't popular and {{accepted}} by kids in school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E
5000|$|And <b>you</b> knew <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> thenGirls were girls, and {{men were}} menMister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I wished {{him to know}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> I wished him to {{understand}} the improbability of your ever again returning to Blakely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{experience}} <b>you</b> had? <b>Who</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> with, and {{how many}} years?" [...] He snapped the questions at Jimmy with the rapidity of machine-gun fire.|$|R

500|$|Kesha {{explained}} that she wanted the song to become a pride anthem; [...] "I wanted to inspire people ... to be themselves. It's a celebration of any sort of quirks or eccentricities." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ... I just felt like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lord, if I {{had known}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> I should have rushed out, and caught {{you in my}} arms,' said Bob Sawyer; 'but upon my life, I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the King's-taxes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] said Breeze dryly, [...] "that, nevertheless, I {{never knew}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> {{and that even}} now I am ignorant whom I am addressing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} made a {{difference}} with me, and it might have made a difference with Berrie. She mightn't have been so free with you at the start, if she'd known <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>You</b> looked sick and kind of lonesome, and that worked on her sympathy." ...|$|R
500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware of <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in the moment? And then think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing {{the air that}} I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? Why am I me? Why... why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that happens {{to me all the}} time.|$|E
500|$|Constantine has {{the belief}} that [...] "anyone can achieve style. It doesn't matter <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> or where you're from." [...] She also says that she finds {{dressing}} other women easy, but finds it difficult when dressing herself. Constantine and Woodall share {{the belief that}} dressing to flatter body shape is vital, stating [...] "For us, it’s all about shape, and how {{that is going to}} cure a bodily defect. We’re like clothing doctors." ...|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker {{and friend}} of Litvinenko Andrei Nekrasov has {{suggested}} that the poison was [...] "sadistically designed to trigger a slow, tortuous and spectacular demise". [...] Expert on Russia Paul Joyal suggested that [...] "A message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin.... If you do, no matter <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> where you are, we will find you, and we will silence you, in the most horrible way possible".|$|E
6000|$|... 'About the {{glimpse of}} the better world,' said Newman. 'I didn't tell her <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> either, or where you'd seen her. I said you loved her to distraction.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I ask why {{you went}} to all this trouble to {{make a fool of}} me? Why could you not have told me <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> from the start?" ...|$|R
60|$|BENNET. Oh yes. AND <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> His lordship, I take it, {{would hardly}} relish the {{discovery}} that he had married his butler's niece. He might consider the situation awkward.|$|R
500|$|He lobbied {{influential}} {{figures in}} Hollywood {{to fund the}} project and {{was reported to have}} recruited the aid of fellow Scientologists in promoting it. According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of 20th Century Fox, [...] "John wanted me to make Battlefield Earth. He had Scientologists all over me. They come up to you and they know <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just feel}} like this record is really different- youve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are!</b> Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Publishers Weekly {{noted that}} friendship and responsibility {{are taught to}} characters in the novels, while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should {{realize that it is}} necessary to experience hardship in life. A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that [...] "it doesn't matter where you come from, only <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> inside". In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said my wife, {{pulling up}} her veil, [...] "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> when <b>you</b> came in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No discourtesy meant," [...] {{he would}} say, after asking. [...] "It's {{not as if}} I had {{forgotten}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> Only it's so dark and my sight isn't what it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do--and I don't," [...] she said, perplexed. [...] "It {{seemed to}} me as if I ought to have {{recognized}} you when I came up, and yet I hadn't the slightest notion <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> I knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> somebody." ...|$|R

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, West {{received}} a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 {{he dropped out of}} college to pursue his musical dreams. This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, [...] "It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> rather than following the path society has carved out for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{out of the}} question. He wouldn't see <b>you,</b> or {{understand}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> And then you'd make a row, and it would all come out, and the fat {{would be in the}} fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{likely it}} was he," [...] said Jonas. [...] "If {{he had only}} known <b>who</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> {{he would have liked}} very much to have come along with you; and <b>you</b> would have <b>been</b> good company for each other.|$|R
