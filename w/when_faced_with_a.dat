5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E

25|$|Although the Luftwaffe {{eventually}} allocated {{more resources}} to the coming campaign than the RAF did during the Battle of Britain in 1940, it failed to commit these resources {{at a time when}} the Allied air offensive might have been checked. The Luftwaffes key mistakes in leadership, production and training decisions that eventually cost it the campaign were made in 1940–1942. The German leadership failed to develop a coherent air strategy for a long war. Strategic blindness, operational effectiveness and missteps paired with a failure to assign air defence as a top priority undermined the Luftwaffes efforts in 1943–1945. German strategy, termed the cult of the offensive, worked in 1939–41, but <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> war of attrition, the growing power of its enemies, its forces spread thin over four fronts, the failure to develop defensive doctrines, tactics and plans led to defeat.|$|E

25|$|Honing theory, {{developed}} principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, {{posits that}} creativity arises {{due to the}} self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is {{a way in which}} the individual hones (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. <b>When</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game. The {{player can}} perform several actions, {{including}} jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their heads-up display (HUD), denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch them out with another gun they find. Most guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat.

25|$|The jō, {{like its}} larger sibling the Bō, {{was never an}} {{effective}} killing-weapon on the battlefield {{in comparison to the}} sword, spear, glaive and bow. Although the jō and most other staves could be used to lethal effect when thrust at vital points of the body, <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fully armored opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armour-plating. As a result, there were very few ryu that were dedicated to the staff-arts in the warring era with other more effective weapons were available, but there are several ryu that include jō techniques in its system. One example is the jō-tradition found in the koryū art Tendō-ryū Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tendō-ryū, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the jō that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo-period (1603–1867), the conflicts with heavy armored warriors became a thing of the past. In this era, the jō art would come into its own against non-armored samurai, rōnin, bandits, and other opponents. It was extensively used to police the local clan domains.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} quarter, Ohio {{embarked}} on a drive during which they gained 26 yards on a flea flicker pass from Tettleton to Daz'mond Patterson, gained 15 more thanks to a personal foul on ECU, and then scored on a 17-yard swing pass from Tettleton to Patterson, making the score 14–7 ECU. ECU's offense took the field and used predominantly a no huddle offense that once caused an illegal substitution penalty on Ohio, however they committed a delay of game penalty when there was confusion on a play call. On that drive, they stalled around midfield and punted for a touchback. Ohio's subsequent drive lasted only one play – an 80-yard touchdown pass from Derrius Vick, Ohio's second quarterback, whom they previously used predominantly for running, to Donte Foster that tied the game at 14. As happened in the first quarter, ECU stalled in the red zone on their ensuing drive, failing to convert a fourth down, but Ohio went three-and-out, thus negating their momentum. ECU, relying predominantly on their running game (seven of nine plays) again approached scoring territory, but <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3rd down and 15, failed to convert the first down, and settled for a field goal try for Warren Harvey, who made a 41-yard attempt, taking the lead for the Pirates, 17–14.|$|E
