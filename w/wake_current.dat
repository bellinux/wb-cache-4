Aiming at {{hydrodynamic}} performance prediction for hydroplane motion, {{numerical simulation}} calculation for direct route motion of a hydroplane {{was carried out}} under FLUENT software platform by using VOF method and RNG k-ε model and solving Navier-Stokes equation. Evolution of ship resistance was obtained as the velocity change, and flow field situation and dynamic pressure variation of hydroplane hull bottom were reflected intuitively. By comparing the results of FLUENT calculation and ship model experiment and theoretical estimation, analyzing, especially <b>wake</b> <b>current,</b> it was verified that numerical simulation calculation of hydroplane direct route motion and hydrodynamic performance prediction based on FLUENT are feasible and precise enough...|$|E
40|$|Intercomparisons {{are made}} among the angular {{distributions}} of ions {{in the wake}} of a body moving through a space plasma as computed from three different expressions (models). Both subsonic and supersonic relative flows are considered in order to examine the <b>wake</b> <b>current</b> depletion ratios under conditions realistic for the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere. Results of these comparisons demonstrate the importance of including the thermal flux at low Mach numbers and of taking into account the angular acceptance of ion detectors in making theory-experiment comparisons. Gradients in the angular variations of the fluxes are found to be steeper near the wake-ambient interface than closer to the maximum rarefaction region of all models, although quantitatively there is considerable variation among the models. From examining the variations of the wake depletion ratio parametrically with Mach number and normalized potential over ranges characteristic of the plasmasphere and topside ionosphere, we find considerable variation with both parameters, with sensitivity to normalized potential increasing dramatically with Mach number. Overall, however, the Mach number variation appears to be the more significant over this range of parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{foreclosure}} crisis {{which began}} in 2008 is old news; or is it? A lot of {{attention has been paid}} to the plight of homeowners struggling to save their homes from foreclosure. Legislative and regulatory changes have made it easier for homeowners to navigate the loss mitigation process. A significant number of people, however, did not try to save their homes. In fact, some actively tried unsuccessfully to give the homes back to their lender. These abandoned homes and abandoned foreclosures have become zombie mortgages. This is the legacy of this crisis. The existence of these homes is well documented and this paper does not seek to prove the problem. Instead, it analyzes some solutions. How can homeowners re-gain control of these homes in order to solve the urban plight problem the foreclosure crisis left in its <b>wake?</b> <b>Current</b> law does not anticipate a bank not seeking foreclosure. Should it? Courts are just beginning to grapple with the situation. No consistent patterns have emerged to deal with the issues. The mortgage industry has argued throughout this crisis that delays in judicial foreclosure are one of the causes of this phenomena. The data has failed to support this hypothesis. On the contrary, this paper argues that the industry used every legal maneuver possible to exacerbate the problem. Lenders have been allowed to enjoy the benefits of the mortgage, while avoiding the burdens. Changes in policy and perception are needed if we are ever to move pass the crisis...|$|E
40|$|A TerraSAR-X (TS-X) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image {{acquired}} at the East China Sea {{offshore wind}} farm presents distinct wakes at a kilometer scale {{on the lee}} of the wind turbines. The presumption was that these wakes were caused by wind movement around turbine blades. However, wind analysis using spaceborne radiometer data, numerical weather prediction, and in situ measurements suggest that the prevailing wind direction did not align with the wakes. By analyzing measurement at the tidal gauge station and modeling of the tidal current field, these trailing wakes are interpreted to have formed when a strong tidal current impinged on the cylindrical monopiles of the wind turbines. A numerical simulation was further conducted to reproduce the tidal <b>current</b> <b>wake</b> under such conditions. Comparison of the simulated surface velocity in the wake region with the TS-X sea surface backscatter intensity shows a similar trend. Consequently, turbulence intensity (T. I.) of the tidal <b>current</b> <b>wakes</b> over multiple piles is studied using the TS-X observation. It is found that the T. I. has a logarithmic relation with distance. Furthermore, another case study showing wakes due to wind movement around turbine blades is presented to discuss {{the differences in the}} tidal <b>current</b> <b>wakes</b> and wind turbine wakes. The conclusion is drawn that small-scale wakes formed by interaction of the tidal current and the turbine piles could be also imaged by SAR when certain conditions are satisfied.

40|$|Wind- and current-induced island wakes were {{investigated}} using a multiplatform approach of in situ, remote sensing, and numerical model simulations for the Southern California Bight (SCB). Island wind wakes {{are a result}} of sheltering from the wind, with weak wind mixing, strong heat storage, and consequent high sea surface temperature (SST). Wind wakes around Santa Catalina Island are most persistent during spring and summer months. <b>Current</b> <b>wakes,</b> caused by the disruption of the poleward traveling California Countercurrent, induce eddies to form off the north end of Catalina Island, and these move poleward every 9 - 12 days. <b>Current</b> <b>wake</b> eddies induce strong mixing, with low SST and high-density sea surface signatures, whereas wind wakes induce high sea surface temperature signatures associated with the formation of a well-defined shallow thermocline. <b>Current</b> <b>wake</b> eddies vary from 1 to 30 km in diameter. From numerical solutions we predicted the frequency of occurrence of current-induced wakes off Santa Catalina Island. Wind wakes were also observed off all the other islands of the SCB as seen from the analysis of synthetic aperture radar data. Time series analysis of the island mass effect phenomenon has shown a concurrence of low SST and high sea surface chlorophyll for Santa Catalina, San Nicholas, and San Clemente islands that might be related to the seasonality of the California Current and California Countercurrent. Future oceanographic research in the SCB should not ignore the occurrence of wind- and current-induced island features since they may be important in the transport and/or retention of nutrients, pollutants, and plankton...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore whether patient {{empowerment}} flourishes in the <b>wake</b> of <b>current</b> health reforms or if there is a power struggle between nursing and medicine as to what is in the patients' best interest. Shifting the balance of power from healthcare professionals to patients has become a key element of healthcare policy in England. The RCN's definition of nursing places patient empowerment as a central remit of nurses. However, achieving genuine patient empowerment is not easy and requires individuals and organizations to alter their beliefs, values and behaviours. To empower patients nurses must be in a position to share power and this may require a realignment of the traditional power base within health care. Although empowerment is often viewed on a one-to-one level between professionals and patients, for true patient empowerment to occur, issues of power and control must also be addressed at a national and political level...|$|R

We review the main positions pro and contra stability of culture and propose two rival hypotheses targeted at the current financial and economic crisis as a strong external force potentially triggering culture change. We test these hypotheses by comparing societal culture data collected with the GLOBE questionnaire from students in 1999 and 2009. Additionally, we perform a series of within-samples analyses of the 2009 data in order to explore {{the impact of the}} crisis. The results show no significant differences between 1999 and 2009, while one of the within-sample analyses (testing the impact of personal exposure to the crisis) indicates significant differences for one dimension of societal culture practices, namely Performance Orientation. Furthermore, a factor representing perceptions of societal consequences emerges as a suitable predictor of Performance Orientation.

Following {{the dissolution of}} the Soviet Union, both these processes were reversed, giving modern-day Ukraine the image of untapped agricultural potential.
