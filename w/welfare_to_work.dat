In major issues with foreign policy complications, He paid close attention to both the United States and the EU, especially regarding the deregulation of the Bank of England, the <b>Welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> program, and his response to the worldwide financial crisis at the G20 summit in London in 2009. [...] Brown decided in 1997 to follow the American model and grant operational independence to set interest rates [...] to the Bank of England, rather than have the power remain with the Treasury. He explained the Bank's monetary policy objective [...] "will be to deliver price stability and...to support the Government's economic policy." [...] Brown argued for a neoliberal policy on welfare in 1997. His goal was to move people off welfare and into actual employment. He stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|Blair {{appointed}} David Freud, {{a former}} vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS, as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform in December 2006. Freud's 2007 report - dubbed 'the Freud report' but officially titled Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: {{options for the}} future of <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> - called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, for substantial resources to be made available to help people on Incapacity Benefit back into work, and for a single working age benefit payment to replace Housing Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance, etc. His central thesis was that spending on 'delivery' - such as schemes to get people back to work [...] - would save money in the long run because there would be fewer people being paid money in the form of benefits. The DWP coined the term Invest to Save to describe this idea and referred to it in-house as [...] "the AME-DEL switch".|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu {{has been}} {{described}} as 'the advocate of the free-market'. As Prime Minister in his first term, he significantly reformed the banking sector, removing barriers to investment abroad, mandatory purchases of government securities and direct credit. [...] As Minister of Finance (2003–2005), Netanyahu introduced a major overhaul of the Israeli economy. He introduced a <b>welfare</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> program, he led a program of privatization, reduced the size of the public sector, reformed and streamlined the taxation system and passed laws against monopolies and cartels with the aim of increasing competition. Netanyahu extended capital gains taxes from companies to individuals, which allowed him to enlarge the tax base while reducing taxes on incomes. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' {{by the end of his}} tenure. Direct investment in the Israeli economy had increased by an annualized 380%. On the other hand, his critics have labelled his economic views as Margaret Thatcher-inspired [...] "popular capitalism".|$|E

5000|$|Reforming <b>Welfare</b> <b>to</b> Promote <b>Work</b> and Time Limits: [...] The {{welfare reform}} discussions were {{dominated}} by {{the perception that the}} then-existing cash assistance program, AFDC, did not do enough to encourage and require employment, and instead incentivized non-work. Supporters of welfare reform also argued that AFDC fostered divorce and out-of-wedlock birth, and created a culture of dependency on government assistance. Both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans emphasized the need to transform the cash assistance system into a work-focused, time-limited program.|$|R

40|$|Over recent years, several {{developed}} countries have implemented {{earned income tax}} credits in order <b>to</b> encourage <b>welfare</b> recipients <b>to</b> move into <b>work.</b> Here, we investigate the impact of ‘Working Credits', which increased the incentives for <b>welfare</b> recipients <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> {{but only for a}} temporary period. Using differences-in-differences and regression-adjusted differences-in-differences, we find evidence that the introduction of the Working Credit increased employment rates, earnings and exits for those on income support. Results from matched differences-in-differences are less precise, but generally consistent with the other two empirical strategies. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that on a cost-per-job basis, the Working Credit compares favourably with existing labour market programs. ...|$|R
