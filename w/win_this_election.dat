5000|$|On 14 June, it was {{reported}} that radical socialist barrister Michael Mansfield had been nominated by several Cambridge academics, with the lawyer describing his candidature as, [...] "a fine opportunity to defend the principles of Higher Education and critical thinking in particular, which have been steadily eroded by successive governments wedded to market forces." [...] In their supporting letter, his nominators contrasted his stance on several issues with that of Lord Sainsbury, writing that, [...] "even if Mr Mansfield does not <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> the campaign in his support will be able to articulate very clearly the fundamental opposition between what these two men stand for.". One of Mansfield's nominators elaborated to the Law Gazette on why the barrister was standing: [...] "Is it too rude to call (Lord Sainsbury) a plutocrat? He has inherited wealth, and represents some of the capitalist focus that threatens the ideas on which a university is founded. We’d like to see someone who is prepared to question the establishment." ...|$|E

Pat Toomey in February 2010 Toomey continued to hold projected leads against his Democratic opponents as the primary campaign entered 2010, with January polls indicating he held a 14-point lead over Specter and a 17-point lead over Sestak. Some political scientists, like G. Terry Madonna and Jeff Brauer, attributed Toomey's gains to voter dissatisfaction with the health care plan before Congress and a poor national political climate for Democrats and incumbents. Toomey's campaign continued to portray him as a political outsider and small government advocate while condemning Specter and Sestak as [...] "a rubber stamp for the Reid-Pelosi big government agenda". In February, it was announced Toomey raised more money than Specter in the final three months of 2009, earning $1.67 million compared to Specter's $1.15 million, although Specter's total war chest of $8.66 million was still significantly larger than Toomey's $2.8 million. In that same quarter, Peg Luksik raised $163,000 and had $66,000 on hand. On February 13, the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania endorsed Toomey over Peg Luskik in the Senate race. Toomey told the committee he would work to restore fiscally conservative principals to Washington and fight to eliminate street money, or state grants offered in exchange for support on key issues. When asked whether Luksik would continue to run, she replied, [...] "Absolutely. Are you kidding? I always run un-endorsed." ...|$|E

The reason: {{the absence of a}} key element in the case. 2 ̆ 2 Nobody claims that any of the absentee votes in Seminole or Martin County, Florida are fraudulent, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Dead people did note vote. Absent a showing of fraud, the votes will not be thrown out. 2 ̆ 2 He continues: 2 ̆ 2 The burden of proof on the Gore team is even higher in these cases than in the one that went sour for them on Monday in the court of Judge Sanders Sauls. Two specific problems confront Gore. First, if there was a negligent but non-malevolent oversight by the election supervisor in allowing others to put numbers on the ballot, the ballot is voided only if the will of the voter is subverted. Nobody says that occurred. Second, in Democratic counties (counties other than Seminole and Martin), the election supervisors in isolated cases permitted ballots to be counted which had no numbers or to which they had placed the numbers. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says there might be a case to sanction some election officials, but little legal basis to throw out the ballots. 2 ̆ 2 Al Gore 2 ̆ 7 s best hope remains the Sanders Sauls case, which he already lost at trial but may secure a glimmer of hope on appeal, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 But appeals from bench trials are much more limited and much less successful than those from jury trials. The Florida Supreme Court has much less leeway to give Al Gore a favorable decision. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says the fat lady is 2 ̆ 2 definitely singing 2 ̆ 2 in this political war. 2 ̆ 2 I believe Al Gore, although he 2 ̆ 7 s desperately anxious to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> is an astute enough politician to see that {{in the very near future}} there is such a pessimistic outlook for the legal remedies that he will stop and say, 2 ̆ 7 enough is enough. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in trial practice, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court.

40|$|Kevin Rudd 2 ̆ 7 s lead in {{the polls}} {{is not hard to}} understand, writes DAVID BURCHELL RECENTLY the {{political}} commentator Robert Manne was musing over the remarkable political rise of Kevin Rudd. He noted the sudden and striking turnaround in the polling figures since Rudd’s ascension to the Labor leadership. “No one knows why it has happened,” he observed, in puzzled tones. And “no one knows whether this kind of polling will last. ” For Manne the electorate appeared like a kind of Delphic oracle, mysterious yet omnipotent. Manne is not alone. Commentators of all persuasions have been exceedingly slow to take the polling figures of the last ten months seriously. Even lifelong pollsters like Sol Lebovic have been suspicious of them, as if the polls were a strange species of poisonous snake that might snap around to bite them. Senior members of the government, meanwhile, have appeared palpably stunned by the turnaround, and have begun to talk as if the electorate were an ungrateful teenager, who fails to understand all the good that has been done for it. Tony Abbott’s parental frustration has been particularly ill-hidden. (My daughter, watching him on TV, recognised it right away.) At one level this bewilderment probably says something about the persistently mysterious character of representative democracy. We all believe somewhere in our minds in the sovereignty of the Australian people over the electoral process. Yet since - unlike the citizens of ancient Athens - the people don’t meet together in some appointed place to make their decisions, commentators and politicians alike are forced to second-guess what “they” really think. And they develop elaborate theories about public attitudes which often amount to little more than educated intuition. Most of the time this strange beast called public opinion seems to scuttle about fairly harmlessly, moving its location only by easily-trackable degrees. From time to time, though, public opinion turns skittish. And then commentators turn into self-imagined wildlife-handlers, attempting to talk the public back onto some more predictable path. On the face of it, though, there’s nothing especially mysterious about the shift in the political atmosphere since December last year. It’s merely that the commentariat - as is so often the case - was so immersed in its own particular mental universe that it failed to notice what was going on. Ever since the 1998 election Labor lacked credibility as an alternative government. Neither Kim Beazley nor Simon Crean commanded conviction as alternative prime ministers. Nor did Labor over that period have much to say that was new and relevant {{in the context of a}} thriving, dynamic society. Mark Latham woke voters up, and suggested new policy themes for Labor’s future. But the brushstrokes were never filled in, and the electorate rightly sensed a troubling volatility about a leader elevated far too early in his career. The initial polling response to Kevin Rudd is perhaps best understood in this context as a collective electoral sigh of relief. At last there was an alternative government worth considering. All the better, given that the incumbents had been in power so long, and were starting to behave like a comfortable regime. Commentators have been inclined to pooh-pooh Rudd’s insistence on the government’s longevity and the PM’s age. On the whole they’ve agreed with Tony Abbott: you should judge a government not by its age, but by its deeds. But the fear that ageing governments will turn sclerotic is a venerable and healthy democratic instinct. Given enough time, even the most democratically-inclined individuals tend to believe themselves destined to rule forever. The mere fact that so many in the government believe they deserve to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> on their past record alone is testimony to this familiar political cancer. Nor is this new. By the early 1990 s many Labor ministers similarly had come to believe that Labor governments were henceforth to be Australia’s manifest destiny. On the account of a senior staffer of the time, one ex-minister was so devastated and uncomprehending about the 1996 defeat that for two years afterwards he kept attempting to issue policy announcements, like a defeated general moving phantom divisions around on a table-top. The same sadly humorous story may well recur after November. However, there’s probably also another, more shadowy, aspect to this widespread incomprehension over the electorate’s skittishness. Commentators of all persuasions have taken to their hearts the belief that “the Howard years” have made a lasting impact on the mood of the nation. The PM’s critics in the intelligentsia love to imagine him as a kind of diabolical Rasputin figure, mesmerising the electorate by appealing to the dark side of the collective unconscious. (That’s especially gratifying if you believe yourself to one of the few not taken in.) His supporters like to imagine Mr Howard connecting with Middle Australia as if through a political umbilical cord. Yet in truth most Australians feel much less strongly about the PM than do members of either commentary camp. Most people don’t feel the need either to love or hate their political leaders. On the whole they merely give them grudging respect: after all, it keeps them on their toes. John Howard has been a competent and conscientious PM, and an effective communicator of conservative political nostrums. His greatest skill, perhaps, lies in pointing out the delusions and shortcomings of his political opponents. That doesn’t mean, though - as it’s so often taken to mean - that he’s somehow managed to shift the basic attitudinal makeup of the majority of Australians. Broadly speaking, there are no more conservatives in Australia than there were eleven years ago. Nor, despite all the intellectual brouhouha about affluence, selfishness and “gated communities,” are Australians obviously less concerned for each others’ welfare than they were back in 1996. Or, to cut a long story short: believe the polls. The electorate does change its mind. And the government is in terminal trouble. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO. Photo: AAP Image/Alan Porrit...|$|E
