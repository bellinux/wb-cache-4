5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, the PLO {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy the PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychological}} battles {{before the}} match saw Australia planting many {{stories in the}} press about England already being in trouble. England kept quieter, until just before the game stories appeared about how the Edgbaston game would be decided at the toss: whichever side won it <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> bowl first and would win. England's mind games paid dividends when Ricky Ponting did just that, as Michael Vaughan admitted {{that if he had}} won the toss, he'd have batted, and as the match progressed, it became clearer and clearer that the pitch would take plenty of turn near the end.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1962, the American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker {{facilitated}} top–secret high–level {{negotiations between}} the Dutch and Indonesian governments. These protracted talks produced a peace settlement known as the New York Agreement on 15 August 1962. As a face-saving measure, the Dutch would hand over West New Guinea to a provisional United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) on 1 October 1962, which then ceded the territory to the Indonesians on 1 May 1963; formally ending the West New Guinea dispute. As part of the New York Agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite would be held in 1969 {{to determine whether the}} Papuans <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination.|$|E
25|$|Nicias, {{exhausted}} and suffering from illness, now believed {{it would be}} impossible to capture Syracuse.

He hoped they <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> recall him, if not the whole expedition, but instead they chose to send reinforcements, under Demosthenes and Eurymedon. Eurymedon left immediately with ten ships, and Demosthenes left sometime later with a much larger force. Meanwhile, in early 413 BC Sparta acted on Alcibiades's advice to fortify Decelea, and the Athenian force sent to relieve it was destroyed.|$|E

25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's dilemma, in which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, even though both players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) are willing to pay to punish if one participant defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{began playing}} {{organized}} ice hockey with local teams in Denver {{and playing with}} travel teams when he was eight years old. He and his family moved back to Texas when Jones was 12. At {{the same time he}} decided he wanted to play for the United States National Team Development Program (NTDP). He played for the Dallas Stars Bantam Major team, scoring 33 points in 31 games. In the 2009 Bantam draft the Everett Silvertips selected Jones eleventh overall. He was projected to be a higher pick in the draft, but concerns that he <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> play college hockey over the Western Hockey League (WHL) caused him to be selected lower. After being drafted Jones played another season in Dallas, with the Stars U-18 team before joining the NTDP.|$|E
25|$|As {{the game}} was under development, various ideas were {{rejected}} as the team settled on an approach. For example, initially, the developers planned to have an Active Time Battle combat system, before going with the Conditional Time Battle system. Another rejected idea was an auto-equip for weapons and armor, which would automatically equip the strongest piece of equipment. In tandem with this was an auto-allocation of experience points, whereby the game <b>would</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> distribute points among the various attributes. Another rejected idea was that in Evil Mode, the good characters against whom the player would be fighting would replicate the actions taken by the player when they had played through the main game; the player's actions during the main game would be replicated by the AI controlled party. Eventually, however, this idea was scrapped and Evil Mode was simplified.|$|E
