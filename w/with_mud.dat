5|$|Adobe {{walls were}} {{historically}} made by laying the bricks <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had {{completely}} rotted {{away by the}} time the tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals long gone.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} phosphate-phosphorus from drain water using bauxite {{refining}} residue was investigated by conducting tests mixing phosphate solution <b>with</b> red <b>mud,</b> and red <b>mud</b> neutralized <b>with</b> phosphogypsum or copperas.

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill <b>with</b> <b>mud,</b> leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. <b>With</b> puddled <b>mud,</b> a hand-made mud form is filled <b>with</b> wetter <b>mud</b> and allowed to dry.|$|R

5|$|Hearths and oblong shaped ovens {{were found}} in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the hearth and the ovens found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the ovens, likely for {{community}} feeding. Rice was a staple food. Mud boundary walls of houses were traced. Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that houses were destroyed by fire. Houses were larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> plaster and flooring of fired earth. A circular hearth and a few post-holes were also found.|$|E
5|$|In early 1855, {{less than}} twenty years after the colony was founded, South Australia's first horse tram began {{operating}} between Goolwa and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> in winter and dust in summer, led to the decision {{that they would not}} be reliable.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E
50|$|The term mudflation {{became popular}} {{during the height}} of the MMORPG EverQuests dominance, coming into common usage after the release of the Ruins of Kunark (2000) expansion.

According to Google Groups, the earliest Usenet posting that used this term was from April 1993.|$|R
40|$|In this study, 10 healthy {{students}} {{were subjected to}} experiments. They bathed in plain hot spring water and hot spring water with 2 % Togol mud at 39 ℃ for 10 min at an interval of 1 week. No difference in the change rates of pulse rate and blood pressure was observed between {{the two types of}} bathing. Forehead and oral temperatures decreased slightly after bathing in plain hot spring water. However, after bathing in hot spring water <b>with</b> Togol <b>mud,</b> the forehead temperature tended to be higher than that before bathing while the oral temperature increased significantly after bathing. Skin surface temperatures on the chest wall, left instep, and right forearm increased significantly after both types of bathing. Changes in the skin temperature after bathing in hot spring water <b>with</b> Togol <b>mud</b> tended to be greater than those after bathing in plain hot spring water. Eight out of 10 students felt warmer after bathing in hot spring water <b>with</b> Togol <b>mud.</b> These findings suggest that bathing in hot spring water <b>with</b> Togol <b>mud</b> is useful for medical care...|$|R
40|$|Red mud {{is a waste}} {{by-product}} generated {{during the}} processing of bauxite, the most common ore of aluminium. With the presence of ferric oxide, high surface area, resistance to poisoning and low cost, red mud made itself a good alternative to the existing commercial automobile catalyst. The cascading of dielectric barrier discharge plasma <b>with</b> red <b>mud</b> improved the NOX removal from diesel engine exhaust significantly. The DeNO(X) efficiency with discharge plasma was 74 % and that <b>with</b> red <b>mud</b> was 31 %. The efficiency increased to 92 % when plasma was cascaded <b>with</b> red <b>mud</b> catalyst operating at a temperature of 400 degrees C. The NOX removal was dominated by NO 2 removal. The studies were conducted at different temperatures {{and the results were}} discussed...|$|R

Upon leaving the woods, Route370 crosses the county line from Susquehanna County to Wayne County and enters Preston Township. At the intersection <b>with</b> <b>Mud</b> Pond Road, the highway bends eastward but returns to its northeastern progression at an intersection with Blewett Road. Route370 turns to the east once again and enters the community of Orson.|$|E
5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E

5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link <b>with</b> <b>Mud</b> Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King in Mud Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, a {{town that}} at that time had a {{population}} of approximately85,000, 20,000were left homeless (nearly {{one third of the}} towns population), and an additional 4,000were injured. It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city <b>with</b> <b>mud</b> filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to many homes and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud. Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.|$|E
