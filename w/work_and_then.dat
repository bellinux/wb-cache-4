5|$|Elena is a {{professional}} journalist, who first focuses on documentary <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> moves into news broadcast. In the first video game, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, Elena follows Drake, filming a documentary on his archaeological findings. Her network has instructed her to film him while he raises the coffin of Sir Francis Drake {{from the bottom of}} the ocean, which he locates from coordinates on a family heirloom ring he wears around his neck. After she and Drake are attacked by pirates (Drake fought them off), he abandons her and leaves with Victor Sullivan to find the lost treasure of El Dorado. Despite Drake's attempts, Elena manages to find him, but when they attempt to fly to another location, they are shot down by anti-aircraft fire. They meet up with Sullivan, who they thought had been killed. After discovering that the statue is cursed, Drake must stop Gabriel Roman from using its power, and save Elena in the process. After doing so, Elena, Drake, and Sullivan drive off into the sunset a boat loaded with several small boxes of treasure In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Elena happens across him in Nepal. Elena now acts as an investigative journalist; she and her cameraman Jeff are attempting to prove that war criminal Lazarevic is alive, contrary to the beliefs of NATO. After Lazarevic executes her cameraman, she manages to escape with Drake. She goes ahead of him to a village in Tibet, where she meets Karl Schäfer, a German who had led a Schutzstaffel expedition to Shambhala. Drake and Elena track Lazaravic to a monastery, where they find the entrance to Shambhala. Once inside, they discover that the monsters Drake has been seeing in the area are guardians of the city. Lazaravic apprehends them, but they escape when the guardians attack. Before he confronts Lazaravic, Drake's former partner Harry Flynn almost kills Elena with a grenade. When Lazaravic is confronted, Drake wounds Lazaravic, and leave the guardians to kill him while Drake makes his escape. When she recuperates, the two return to the village and begin a relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{he encountered}} in producing it were very great, for the foundations had been ill-prepared by his predecessors, {{and he was}} obliged to be artisan and architect at the same time. He had to collect manuscripts {{from all parts of}} Portugal, decipher, classify and weigh them before he could begin <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he found it necessary to break with precedents and destroy traditions. Serious students in Portugal and abroad welcomed the book as an historical work of the first rank, for its evidence of careful research, its able marshalling of facts, its scholarship and its painful accuracy, while the sculptural simplicity of the style and the correctness of the diction made it a Portuguese classic. The second volume of his history appeared in 1847, the third in 1849, and the fourth in 1853.|$|E
25|$|The {{fixtures}} postponed due to Piermario Morosini's death {{were played}} mid-week {{in the last}} full week of April and Parma were up against a tricky trip to Sicily to play Palermo. Abel Hernández got the first goal with a header at the back post after he was found by Andrea Mantovani in the sixth minute. Palermo had the better {{of the first half}} and deserved their lead, but it was Parma who started the second half better and Giovinco's fine run and shot was parried into Stefano Okaka's path and the striker made no mistake to level with his head. With 20 minutes to go, Giovinco again did some good <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> found Jonathan Biabiany free in the area. The Frenchman steered the ball into the Palermo net to give the away side the lead. This left Parma 9 points clear of relegation with 4 games to go.|$|E

Smalley's response began by apologizing for any offense his September 2001 article had caused, and stating that Drexler's book Engines of Creation had triggered Smalley's own interest in nanotechnology. He agreed that [...] "Smalley fingers" [...] could not <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> asserted that the same reasons that would preclude atomic control of reactions would also preclude the manipulation of larger building blocks, since each molecule would have multiple atoms which {{would need to be}} controlled ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E

500|$|... "Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and was {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It was the one-hundredth episode of Will & Grace, and the producers celebrated the milestone by planning an hour-long episode followed by a clip show featuring highlights and outtakes from past seasons. In an interview with The Jewish Journal in 2001, David Kohan, the co-creator of Will & Grace, in discussing the lead characters, stated that a marriage {{could be a problem}} for the dynamic between the two characters: [...] "I'd love for [...] to find a Jewish love interest, but that relationship might actually <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there'd be no more 'Will & Grace'." [...] Kohan, however, changed his mind by the time of a follow-up interview in 2002: he noted that the characters had to [...] "move on forward in their lives in some way" [...] and it would be unlikely that Grace's possible husband would displace her gay best friend, Will. In July 2002, reports surfaced that a possible wedding involving Grace would happen, but the staff were not allowed to reveal anything.|$|E
500|$|... "Pokey Mom" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). According to then-showrunner Mike Scully, the story of this episode originated {{from the fact that the}} staff members of The Simpsons wanted to do an episode about Marge but felt they did not want it to revolve around her getting a new job, as that had been seen on the show [...] "too often". They decided to explore one of Marge's attributes that had been seen in earlier episodes, eventually choosing her interest in art. Martin conceived of the sub-plot surrounding Homer following a visit to a chiropractor. He has said that the [...] "heart" [...] of that story is that the chiropractors in Springfield become opposed to Homer's method of healing people and try to stop it after losing business, in reference to how chiropractors in real-life [...] "are a bit hated by the AMA (American Medical Association)" [...] and how the AMA has tried to restrict their businesses in the past. Martin has also noted that the episode shows how [...] "a lot of chiropractors are these great healers and they do great <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there's some that are crooked." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} (and final) book is a {{discussion}} of paranatellonta via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff, but, before the creature could consume its victim, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) stumbled onto the scene. He instantly {{fell in love with}} Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, [...] "is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time: Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monsterstrictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as belua (5.544, 608) and monstrum (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia". Green contends that the story is perfect for Manilius (he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360). Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story, and called Manilius's retelling [...] "a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple" [...] (purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus). A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode {{was meant to be a}} [...] "show piece", it comes across as [...] "a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace". Between lines 5.70910, there is a large lacuna (raising the possibility that the Astronomica is an unfinished <b>work),</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the last few lines of the book [...] concern stars and other stellar phenomena, and the book ends with a simile about the [...] "res publica of stars". This sectionin which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized commonwealth, defined by a hierarchy that prevents [...] "cosmic disaster"seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.|$|E
