5000|$|For {{residents}} of rural areas, the lengthy travel time and distance to larger, more developed urban and metropolitan health centers present significant restrictions on access to essential health care services. Telemedicine {{has been suggested}} {{as a way of}} overcoming transportation barriers for patients and health care providers in rural and geographically isolated areas. According to the Health Resources Services Administration, telemedicine may be defined as the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support long-distance healthcare and clinical relationships. Relevant literature notes that telemedicine provides clinical, education, and administrative benefits for rural areas. [...] First, telemedicine eases the burden of clinical services by the utilization of electronic technology in the direct interaction between health care providers, such as primary and specialist health providers, nurses, and technologists and patients in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases and illnesses. Secondly, the advantage of telemedicine on educational services includes the delivery of healthcare related lectures and workshops through video and tele-conferencing, practical simulations, and <b>web</b> <b>casting.</b> In rural communities, medical professionals may utilize pre-recorded lectures for medical or health care students at remote sites. Also, healthcare practitioners in urban and metropolitan areas may utilize teleconferences and diagnostic simulations to assist understaffed healthcare centers in rural communities diagnose and treat patients from a distance. In a study of rural Queensland health systems, more developed urban health centers used video-conferencing to educate rural physicians on treatment and diagnostic advancements for breast and prostate cancer, as well as various skin disorders, such as eczema and chronic irritations. Thirdly, telemedicine may pose significant administrative benefits to rural areas. Not only does telemedicine aid in the collaboration among health providers with regard to the utilization of electronic medical records, but telemedicine may pose benefits for interviewing medical professionals in remote areas for position vacancies and the transmission of necessary operation-related information between rural health systems and larger, more developed healthcare systems.|$|E

A broadcast and select based optical switching core can handle efficiently multicast/broadcast traffic while featuring low latency and high bit rates and/or high throughputs. Two designs of switching cores are described. When the traffic is aggregated into superframes, such as in a backbone network, an optical switching core with broadcast and select fabric and tunable filters can be used. When arbitrary frame sizes need to be supported, a hybrid switching fabric is described that uses optics for distribution and high-speed backplane or interconnect and electronic switching between the detectors and the outgoing line cards.

The main objective is to allow components of a group service to be changed at run time using reflection and component architecture technology. 1 Introduction Distributed applications such as video-conferencing, video-on-demand, CSCW, <b>web</b> <b>casting,</b> and distributed simulation are demanding new features from the underlying platforms. One example is the support for groups of users where multiple senders and receivers disseminate or share the same data. Improvements in communication technology have brought an efficient solution for dealing with a set of users as a single entity and using multipoint communication (multicast) to send the same data to each member of the group. Our concern in this paper is related to the complexity involved in the development of group applications. Although a simple multicast facility can be suitable for some cases, more complex requirements can [...] ...|$|E
