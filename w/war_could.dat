5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} <b>war</b> <b>could</b> no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about {{upcoming}} military campaigns {{to the point of}} thinking the end of the <b>war</b> <b>could</b> be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of the pandemic and the <b>war</b> <b>could</b> have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years {{by the time the}} pandemic struck. This left little time for the disease to {{have a significant impact on}} the economy.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, the {{atmosphere}} altered: <b>wars</b> <b>could</b> not be won through bloodshed but {{by winning the}} hearts and minds of people. Consequently, the Truman administration changed their foreign policy from traditional warfare to psychological warfare.|$|R
5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the <b>war</b> <b>could</b> not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Sir Isaac Brock KB (6 October 1769– 13 October 1812) was a British Army {{officer and}} colonial {{administrator}} from Guernsey. Brock {{was assigned to}} Lower Canada in 1802. Despite facing desertions and near-mutinies, he commanded his regiment in Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) successfully for many years. He was promoted to major general, and became responsible for defending Upper Canada against the United States. While many in Canada and Britain believed <b>war</b> <b>could</b> be averted, Brock began to ready the army and militia for what was to come. When the War of 1812 broke out, the populace was prepared, and quick victories at Fort Mackinac and Detroit defeated American invasion efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk <b>War</b> <b>could</b> have been avoided had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
50|$|In desperation, the {{corporations}} turned {{control of the}} galactic economy over to modified Mech control systems, hoping that the maniacal intelligence that had served them so well in the Energy <b>Wars</b> <b>could</b> {{find a way to}} allocate the scarce resources so all could profit.|$|R
5000|$|Submarine, a ship {{capable of}} {{remaining}} underwater for extended periods. Submarines {{in the world}} <b>wars</b> <b>could</b> stay under {{for less than a}} day, but development of nuclear reactors and air-independent propulsion allows submarines to stay submerged for weeks, even months at a time, with food supplies as the only limiting factor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{recommendations}} were {{to form the}} basis of Army reform for the next 60 years. Military historian Correlli Barnett wrote that the Esher Report's importance [...] "and its consequences can hardly be exaggerated.... Without the Esher Report... it is inconceivable that the mammoth British military efforts of two world <b>wars</b> <b>could</b> have been possible, let alone so generally successful." ...|$|R
5|$|When Nixon took office, about 300 American {{soldiers}} were dying each week in Vietnam, {{and the war}} was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam <b>War</b> <b>could</b> not be won and {{he was determined to}} end the war quickly. He sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the main}} {{military}} leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which {{made it clear that the}} <b>war</b> <b>could</b> not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.|$|E
5|$|By October 1906, {{many in the}} U.S. government, {{including}} Secretary of State Elihu Root, {{were worried}} that <b>war</b> <b>could</b> break out in the Pacific between the United States and Japan. However, the Aleutian Islands {{were believed to be}} of little strategic importance to the United States, and were ignored by a number of pre-war strategies formulated by the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval War Board's 1896 plan, which would have brought only a few scout ships to the Islands. In 1911, the Naval War Board considered three options through which Japan could mount an invasion of the United States, one of which involved an attack on the Aleutian Islands. However, this option was discarded by the Board owing to the cold climate of the islands.|$|E
50|$|According to {{economic}} experts canvassed by PolitiFact, the tariffs could help create new manufacturing jobs {{and lead to}} some concessions from the U.S.'s foreign trading partners, but consumer costs and production costs would almost certainly rise, the stock market would fall, interest rates could rise, and trade <b>wars</b> <b>could</b> occur. PolitiFact noted that lower-income consumers in the United States would be hurt the most.|$|R

5|$|The Athenian {{politician}} Philocrates {{had suggested}} offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, {{and by the}} time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands. Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that the Sacred <b>War</b> <b>could</b> only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.|$|E
5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the <b>war</b> <b>could</b> ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E
5|$|The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to fight a}} major battle. Instead, he ordered Warsaw to be fortified and allowed the Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the <b>war</b> <b>could</b> only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed Warsaw would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact to fight a decisive battle against the Russians, who by then would be cut off from their rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki {{was forced to resign}} and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of Warsaw.|$|E

50|$|The Idea of Progress emerged {{primarily}} in the Enlightenment in the 18th century, although some scholars like Nisbet (1980) have traced it to ancient Christian notions. The theory of evolution {{in the nineteenth century}} made progress a necessary law of nature and gave the doctrine its first conscious scientific form. The idea was challenged by the 20th century realization that destruction, as in the two world <b>wars,</b> <b>could</b> grow out of technical progress.|$|R
5|$|Through 1971, it was {{uncertain}} if Agnew would be retained {{on the ticket}} as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former Governor of Texas. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam <b>War</b> <b>could</b> be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid {{at the start of}} 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed <b>war</b> <b>could</b> be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E
25|$|Men, women, and {{children}} may all {{be taken as}} prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of <b>war</b> <b>could</b> be, {{at the discretion of}} the military leader, executed, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept as slaves. In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of <b>war</b> <b>could</b> secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write. Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.|$|E
