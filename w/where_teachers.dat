5|$|The early Western Han court {{simultaneously}} {{accepted the}} philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (bóshì 博士) {{not dealing with}} the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign {{was the creation of}} Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.|$|E

25|$|Professional {{development}} {{also became}} a concern. In 1984, NYSUT successfully pushed for passage of a state law creating and funding centers <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> could obtain continuing education. In 1986, the union won passage of a bill creating mandatory mentor-intern programs in schools, so that established teachers {{would be able to}} mentor student-teachers during their internships in the public schools.|$|E
25|$|Discipline in {{educational}} institutions {{from high school}} and up (including vocational schools) are the responsibility of military officers stationed at the individual schools (as opposed to elementary and junior high school <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> and school administrators were responsible for discipline). In addition to the normal subjects, students are also required to attend a military education class covering issues such as civil defense, military drills, national defense, and basic firearms. In the past, high (and vocational) school students were expected to take on civil defense duties in the event of national emergency. Boys and girls were trained to use firearms and hurl grenades.|$|E
25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> do not frequently use complex sentences.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{evaluation}} on employee performance is traditionally {{studied in the}} context of the principal-agent problem. Evaluation can, however, also be characterized as an investment in the evaluated employee’s human capital. We study a sample of mid-career public school <b>teachers</b> <b>where</b> we can consider these two types of evaluation effect separately. Employee evaluation is a particularly salient topic in public schools <b>where</b> <b>teacher</b> effectiveness varies substantially and <b>where</b> <b>teacher</b> evaluation itself is increasingly a focus of public policy proposals. We find evidence that a quality classroom-observation-based evaluation and performance measures can improve mid-career teacher performance both during the period of evaluation, consistent with the traditional predictions; and in subsequent years, consistent with human capital investment. However the estimated improvements during evaluation are less precise. Additionally, the effects sizes represent a substantial gain in welfare given the program’s costs. ...|$|R

25|$|A {{major change}} in policy came in 2003, when the cantonal {{government}} proposed a number of spending cuts, including a proposal according to which new Romansh teaching materials would not be published except in Rumantsch Grischun from 2006 onwards, the logical result {{of which would be}} to abolish the regional varieties as languages of instruction. The cantonal parliament passed the measure in August 2003, even advancing the deadline to 2005. The decision was met by strong opposition, in particular in the Engadine, <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> collected over 4,300 signatures opposing the measure, followed by a second petition signed by around 180 Romansh writers and cultural figures, including many who were supportive of Rumantsch Grischun but opposed its introduction as a language of instruction.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff {{felt that}} the {{traditional}} methods of self-knowledge—those of the fakir, monk, and yogi (acquired, respectively, through pain, devotion, and study)—were inadequate {{on their own and}} often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness. His methods were designed to augment the traditional paths with the purpose of hastening the developmental process. He sometimes called these methods The Way of the Sly Man because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results. The teacher, possessing consciousness, sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual. Instructive historical parallels {{can be found in the}} annals of Zen Buddhism, <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of insight in the student.|$|E

25|$|The Colonial {{government}} {{meant to}} carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923–24 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924–1935), and Dr. James Aggrey was the first Vice-Principal (1924–1927). Fraser had previously been Principal of Trinity College, Kandy, an elite school in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education {{at a time when the}} idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.|$|E

2500|$|Jerome Bruner {{is notable}} for {{integrating}} Piaget's cognitive approaches into educational psychology. He advocated for discovery learning <b>where</b> <b>teachers</b> create a problem solving environment {{that allows the}} student to question, explore and experiment. In his book The Process of Education Bruner stated that {{the structure of the}} material and the cognitive abilities of the person are important in learning. He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject {{in a way that was}} easy for the student to understand. [...] In the early 1960s Bruner went to Africa to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a cultural institution. [...] Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined anthropology and science. The program explored human evolution and social behavior. [...] He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.|$|E
