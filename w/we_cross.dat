2500|$|Primary {{reasons for}} Turkey's {{persistent}} requests {{to join the}} EU are, among others, the many Turks in Europe {{and the importance of}} trade between the two. Turkey is, however, also increasingly disappointed with the widespread opposition to its accession among EU member states. In September 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan was asked by CNN if Turkey still wants to join the EU. His response: [...] "There are 5 million Turks in Europe and 3 million Turks in Germany alone. We are a natural member of the European Union. Germany invited Turkish workers 50 years ago, however 50 years have passed and we have waited at the European Union's doorstep. No other country has experienced such a thing. We will be patient until a point. However, when <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> that point, we will bring light to the situation and decide accordingly." [...] During a trip to Yalta, Erdoğan expressed his stern disappointment regarding the EU accession process: [...] "We are still an EU negotiating candidate. At such a position, I wish EU accession. Otherwise, such a scenario would affect a large region including Ukraine and Turkey." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's the neck," [...] he said. [...] "The log <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> {{the river}} on is somewhere abreast of it. We surely can't {{have passed the}} thing." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the lawn, Miss Halcombe {{looked at}} me significantly, and shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|So we flew along all day. At 2 P.M. {{the belt}} of timber that fringes the North Platte and marks its {{windings}} through the vast level {{floor of the}} Plains came in sight. At 4 P.M. <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> {{a branch of the}} river, and at 5 P.M. <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the Platte itself, and landed at Fort Kearney, fifty-six hours out from St. Joe--THREE HUNDRED MILES! ...|$|R
60|$|We {{left the}} room. As <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the hall, a gentleman came forward, {{and spoke to}} Mr. Bernard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me show you, sah. We go up {{for some}} way, den we come on path; two miles farder <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> a road, and den strike into forest again by a little valley wiv a tiny stream running down him. After walk for an hour <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> ober anoder hill all cohered wiv trees and find soon anoder stream, quite little dere; hab a mile we follow him, den we find {{a place where we}} 'top. We long way den from any plantation, dat quite wild country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] Arnold answered. [...] "Step out. <b>We</b> <b>cross</b> this meadow on foot. When {{we reach}} the other end, we shall find Sabatini. Come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{expected}} this. If <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> {{the end of}} {{the hill}} going southeast, we would strike the sands somewhere abreast of the wreck?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was eleven}} o'clock when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the wooden foot-bridge {{of the station}} and emerged upon the street.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> a {{straight}} dusty road, cleaving the rolling moor like a belt of ribbon. Isobel looked thoughtfully along it.|$|R
60|$|Much {{time might}} have been saved had <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the Mohawk to the southward, without venturing near the camps of the British.|$|R
60|$|But now <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the Arve into a {{grove of}} pines, and direct {{our way to the}} ascent. We begin to thread a zigzag path {{on the sides of the}} mountain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect {{she is the}} Cayman and {{the other}} is the Lucia. It looks as if Musgrave had got the men. Shall <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the harbour and see the boats arrive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the Bias River {{again we}} will talk of izzat,' Scott replied. 'Till that day thou and the policemen shall be {{sweepers}} to the camp, if I give the order.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> it in safety. On {{the other}} side {{extended}} a long flat of upheaved crusts of salt and mud, full of holes and pitfalls, an exceedingly toilsome and painful place to travel, and for all we could tell, dangerous too. I had all I could do to watch my feet and find surfaces to hold my steps. Eventually <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> this broken field, reaching {{the edge of the}} gravel slope, where we were very glad indeed to rest.|$|R
60|$|After a mile's {{march from}} Jannah Siri, <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> a ridge of rising ground, and suddenly, as though by magic, the scene shifted.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> {{a walk to}} {{the other}} part of the academy, where, as I have already said, the {{projectors}} in speculative learning resided.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} reach the border in time to warn 'em," [...] said Billy; [...] "but they ain't no chance. If <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> before sunup {{tomorrow}} morning we'll be doin' well." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vanish, ye mists! Not yet do we repair [...] To {{the still}} {{country of the}} {{piercing}} air; [...] But seek, before <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the troubled seas, [...] An English hearth and Devon's waving trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the Bias River {{again we}} will talk of izzat," [...] Scott replied. [...] "Till that day thou and the policemen shall be {{sweepers}} to the camp, if I give the order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you come}} over on the Atlantic, Mr. Crocker?" [...] she said. [...] "Surely not? <b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> on her ourselves. We should have met." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> {{a narrow}} passage and entered a small parlour. Miss Hart {{walked up to}} the mantelpiece and Cecil and I {{remained}} looking round.|$|R
60|$|That night I slept little, but {{the very}} time I wanted to be awake--when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the Mississippi--I was slumbering soundly, and so missed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Otter," [...] put in Leonard, [...] "either you are joking {{or you are}} mad. How can <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> that place? We {{should be}} dashed to pieces before we had gone ten yards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yon," [...] said Pete, [...] "is Bewcastle dale, and I ken where we'll find {{a welcome}} when <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the water o' Line. But I'm {{thinking}} we'll keep the big flow in our left han'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, Hans, but now I mean to show Zikali that I am not his messenger, {{for south}} or north or east or west. So to-morrow morning <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> {{the river and}} trek for Natal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, [...] "but it is {{two hundred}} miles north of us; {{it is one of}} the {{waterways}} <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> on the trip to Thark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{go back to}} {{the last}} creek <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> and catch some trout," [...] he ordered. [...] "Stay there until supper, whether you get any or not." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the square, {{and went}} to the Duomo, to render thanks. We knelt at the altar-rail, and Gervasio knelt above us upon the altar's lowest step.|$|R
