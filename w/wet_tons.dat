40|$|Graduation date: 1947 The Molalla {{quadrangle}} {{is located}} in northwestern Oregon along {{the eastern edge of}} Willamette Valley about 30 miles south of Portland. The area includes part of the Western Cascade foothills as well as a portion of the Willamette Valley lowland. The rocks in the Cascade foothills are marine and terrestrial sediments interlayered with volcanic flows and pyroclastics which range from Eocene (?) to Pliocene or early Pleistocene in age. The oldest rocks consist of approximately 1500 feet of basaltic and andesitic lavas, present in the southeastern portion of the area, and described here as the Pre-Butte Creek lavas. The base or lower part of the series contains interbedded marine pebble conglomerates presumably of Eocene age. To the southwest the laves are unconformably ever-lain with about 1200 feet of marine and terrestrial sediments which have been termed the Butte Creek beds. Field relations indicate a correlation of these sediments with the Oligocene Illahe sandstone, while the faunal study made by Durham suggests a lower Miocene age. In the southwestern part of the quadrangle the Butte Creek beds are unconformably overlain by the middle Miocene Stayton lavas. Several hundred feet of pyroclastics and terrestrial sediments considered early Pliocene in age and described as the Molalla formation are exposed along Molalla River in the eastern and northeastern part of the quadrangle. They rest unconformably on the Pre-Butte Creek lavas and are overlain by Pliocene or early Pleistocene Boring lavas. Where exposed along {{the western edge of the}} Cascade foothills these older formations are covered by middle Pleistocene alluvial deposits which blanket the Willamette valley lowland. All of the Tertiary rocks have been tilted or gently folded. Dips observed in the Butte Creek beds in the southern half of the area average about 6 degrees and indicate an elongate domal fold trending northeasterly. A regional dip of 5 to 8 degrees to the northwest is present in the Molallla formation in the northern part of the area. Minor normal faulting in present locally in the Butte Creek beds.

40|$|There exist few {{life cycle}} {{assessments}} (LCAs) {{in the literature}} {{that focus on the}} second-generation biofuel production from sweet sorghum, a non-food-source feedstock that offers several advantages in terms of farming requirements compared to corn or sugarcane. The objective of this LCA study was to evaluate biofuels produced from sweet sorghum to determine the potential environmental benefits of producing sweet sorghum biofuel compared to conventional fossil fuels. The biofuel production process used for this study differed from other LCAs in that, in parallel to stalk juice extraction and fermentation, residual bagasse and vinasse was pyrolyzed and upgraded to a diesel equivalent as opposed to being fermented or combusted for a source of heat or electricity production. The life cycle inventory included data available in the literature regarding mass and energy input requirements for farming, juice extraction, fermenting, pre-treatment, pyrolysis, and steam reforming steps. Experimental data for bio-oil upgrading was obtained from a pilot plant in Huntsville, AR, including hydrogen gas requirements for hydrotreatment and diesel, biochar, and non-condensable gas yields. The functional unit used for this study was the total kilometers driven by standard passenger vehicles using ethanol, gasoline and diesel produced from 1 ha of harvested sweet sorghum (76 <b>wet</b> <b>tons).</b> Total biofuel yields resulting from this basis were 5, 122 L of bioethanol, 2, 708 L of gasoline and 780 L of diesel. With these yields, distances of 58, 500 km, 21, 500 km, and 12, 070 km were chosen as the functional unit for the combustion of E 85, E 10, and diesel, respectively based on vehicle fuel efficiencies from the GREET model. Compared to conventional gasoline, this production process resulted in nearly 50 % reduction of GHGs and 46 % reduction in fossil fuel depletion, in addition to reductions in eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and carcinogenics. However, fossil fuels were lower by 25 %, 45 %, and 12 % in the categories of non-carcinogenics, respiratory effects, and smog, respectively. These lower impacts for fossil fuels are driven by heavy-metal uptake from corn production and the fact that less electricity is used in the supply chain compared to biofuel production. A Monte Carlo simulation showed the comparative impact assessment results were not sensitive to uncertainty in the life cycle inventory. While the impact assessment showed benefits in producing sweet sorghum biofuel compared to fossil fuels, further research must be conducted on land use and water use. A detailed process simulation, coupled with continued experimental studies of the pyrolysis and upgrading processes, is recommended for further process optimization and heat integration, as well as composition analyses of the various co-products resulting from the process. Further studies will provide valuable information in choosing between feedstocks, specifically those which can be used to produce second-generation biofuels...|$|E
40|$|Vietnam, {{a country}} in South-East Asia, is {{characterized}} by a coastline nearly 3300 km long. The coast; stretching from Gulf of Tonkin in the North to the gulf of Thailand in the South, has a predominant North-South orientation resulting in a rich and varied coastal environment. The people in Vietnam have traditionally relied on the rich coastal resources, first by harvesting natural populations and more recently by implementing aquaculture practices. Next to fish and shellfish, marine seaweeds (macroalgae) have traditionally been harvested among most of the Vietnamese coast. A survey of the uses of Vietnamese seaweeds results in 82 species which are considered economically valuable (Chapter 1). Many of these seaweeds are used for human consumption, while others have a role in traditional medicine or are used for colloid extraction (e. g. agar, carrageenan) or as feed for animals. Contrary however to neighboring countries such as China, the Philippines and Indonesia where seaweed mariculture has been seriously developed over the last decades, culturing seaweeds remains a largely marginal activity in Vietnam. Reasons as to why seaweed mariculture has not taken off as compared to the neighboring countries are at least partly {{to be found in the}} absence of a phycolloid industry in Vietnam. Instead Vietnam exports large amounts of raw seaweeds, harvested from natural populations, at a low price, and then imports the purified phycocolloids at a much higher price. A steadily growing demand for seaweed-derived products results in an increasing pressure on coastal ecosystems which risk overharvesting of natural populations. This risk is especially eminent for the brown algal genus Sargassum of which approximately 50. 000 <b>wet</b> <b>tons</b> is harvested every year. Sargassum represents an important ecosystem engineering species of subtidal coastal habitats. The plants can grow easily up to 3 - 4 m in length and form dense vegetations with a major nursery function for countless juvenile vertebrate and invertebrate species. If plants, the uprights at least are annual, are harvested before becoming fertile, this may reduce the rejuvenation of natural populations and eventually lead to habitat degradation. Despite the value of seaweeds for humans as well as their role in coastal ecosystems in Vietnam, relatively little is known about them. Basic information on for example the number of species present and their distributions is not easily available. Most information on seaweeds is scattered in local literatures, written in Vietnamese. Thereto, we compiled a checklist of Vietnamese seaweeds (Chapter 2). A total of 827 species are reported (412 Rhodophyta, 180 Chlorophyta, 147 Phaeophyceae, 88 Cyanobacteria. This species richness is comparable to that of the Philippines and considerably higher than Taiwan, Thailand or Malaysia. A comparison of the species composition with neighbouring countries yielded surprisingly low similarities. Rather than an indication of a biogeographical pattern, we are of the opinion that the low similarity with neighboring countries is primarily an artifact resulting from taxonomic inconsistencies. The checklist could serve as a valuable tool, to reveal the seaweed diversity in Vietnam and to stimulate intraregional comparative research. Sargassum with 70 species and intraspecific taxa is undoubtedly the most species-rich seaweed genus in Vietnam (Chapter 3). The estimate of Sargassum diversity is however entirely based on interpretations of the morphological characters such as the base, secondary axes, the leaves, vesicles and receptacles. Therefore we reassessed Sargassum diversity based on molecular gene sequence data of the internal spaces of the ribosomal cistron (ITS rDNA) (Chapter 4). Although successful at higher taxonomic levels, subgenera and sections, the resolution of the ITS marker was not sufficient to point species boundaries with confidence. Many morphologically distinct ‘species’ were characterized by virtually identical ITS sequences. Conversely, specimens identified on morphological criteria as one ‘species’ were resolved in different clades. Results could be interpreted in two possible ways. First, traditional species concepts in Sargassum have been too broadly defined and the genus contains far less species. Alternatively, species in Sargassum result from a recent radiation and even the highly variable ITS region does not display enough variation to resolve the relationship among them. To address these outstanding questions we explored to use of Restriction site Associated DNA Sequences (RAD-Seq) to generate a set of highly variable nuclear markers. RAD-sequencing is a Next Generation Sequencing-based technique that generates thousands to hundreds of thousands DNA fragments that can be scored for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) which in turn can be compared between individuals. RAD markers can be used to pinpoint loci under selection, or are used as neutral markers to reconstruct phylogeographical patterns or elucidate phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. During the experiment we generated more than 21 million sequences which after quality control and analyses in Stacks and SiLiX yielded 231 alignments which could potentially be used to address species boundaries in the genus Sargassum. The development of more than 200 markers presents a more than significant increase over markers used in traditional studies which generally combine one or two mitochondrial and/or chloroplast markers with sequences from the ribosomal cistron. It also boosts the number of potential markers by a factor 10 to 20 compared to microsatellite-based studies. Despite these results, there are issues that remain to be solved. For example, the libraries of the individual specimens are highly unequal in size. Some specimens are represented by 1. 5 million sequences while others only have barely 800 sequences. We believe the main reason why some specimens are underrepresented is due to insufficient DNA quality. Therefore, future studies should focus on obtaining high quality DNA from Sargassum. A second issue is posed by the presence of multiple alleles in the final alignments. Normally one would expect 2 alleles per marker for a diploid organism. Our final alignments often contain more than 2 alleles per specimen. It is unclear at present if this is a technical issue which could eventually be solved by fine-tuning the parameters of the Stacks analyses or whether the multiple alleles issue has an underlying biological cause (polyploidisation). Despite these issues, RAD Sequencing has a great potential for population based molecular studies in algae. A selection of the current stacks can be used for primer design which can then be used to score markers by PCR followed by traditional Sanger sequencing. This approach can easily increase the number of nuclear markers for phylogeographic or species delimitation studies by a factor ten. Modest as it may be, I hope that by providing a compilation of the seaweed diversity in Vietnam and their economical importance, and by introducing DNA-based methodologies to assess species diversity in the ecologically and economically important genus Sargassum, I have contributed to the foundation for a sustainable exploitation of natural resources and continuous integrity of marine habitats...|$|E

S. Department of Energy (DOE). The goal {{of the project was}} to identify and evaluate low-value fuels that could serve as alternative feedstocks and to develop a feed system to facilitate their use in integrated gasification combined-cycle and gasification coproduction facilities. The long-term goal, to be accomplished in a subsequent project, is to install a feed system for the selected fuel(s) at Global Energy's commercial-scale 262 -MW Wabash River Coal Gasification Facility in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The feasibility study undertaken for the project consisted of identifying and evaluating the economic feasibility of potential fuel sources, developing a feed system design capable of providing a fuel at 400 psig to the second stage of the E-Gas (Destec) gasifier to be cogasified with coal, performing bench- and pilot-scale testing to verify concepts and clarify decision-based options, reviewing information on high-pressure feed system designs, and determining the economics of cofeeding alternative feedstocks with the conceptual feed system design. A preliminary assessment of feedstock availability within Indiana and Illinois was conducted. Feedstocks evaluated included those with potential tipping fees to offset processing cost: sewage sludge, municipal solid waste, used railroad ties, urban wood waste (UWW), and used tires/tire-derived fuel. Agricultural residues and dedicated energy crop fuels were not considered since they would have a net positive cost to the plant. Based on the feedstock assessment, sewage sludge was selected as the primary feedstock for consideration at the Wabash River Plant. Because of the limited waste heat available for drying and the ability of the gasifier to operate with alternative feedstocks at up to 80 % moisture, a decision was made to investigate a pumping system for delivering the as-received fuel across the pressure boundary into the second stage of the gasifier. A high-pressure feed pump and fuel dispersion nozzles were tested for their ability to cross the pressure boundary and adequately disperse the sludge into the second stage of the gasifier. These results suggest that it is technically feasible to get the sludge dispersed to an appropriate size into the second stage of the gasifier although the recycle syngas pressure needed to disperse the sludge would be higher than originally desired. A preliminary design was prepared for a sludge-receiving, storage, and high-pressure feeding system at the Wabash River Plant. The installed capital costs were estimated at approximately $ 9. 7 million, within an accuracy of {+-} 10 %. An economic analysis using DOE's IGCC Model, Version 3 spreadsheet indicates that in order to justify the additional capital cost of the system, Global Energy would have to receive a tipping fee of $ 12. 40 per <b>wet</b> <b>ton</b> of municipal sludge delivered. This is based on operation with petroleum coke as the primary fuel. Similarly, with coal as the primary fuel, a minimum tipping of $ 16. 70 would be required.

The focus of our work concerns the potential for P to dissolve in water from dairy manure or poultry litter applied to soil. The objectives of our research were to quantify P released from manure-amended soils with different antecedent soil test P levels and to elucidate manure P chemical properties controlling P loss to runoff water. For this research, we used water-extractable P in raw manures and manure-amended soils with water as an indicator of the relative susceptibility of P in these materials in the field to dissolution and removal by runoff water. The P in raw poultry litter is very different from that in dairy manure. Poultry litters can be more than ten times more concentrated in P than semi-solid dairy manures on a per <b>ton</b> <b>wet</b> weight basis. For example, in one of our experiments, a 3 ton/acre application of raw poultry litter contained the same amount of total P as a 25 ton/acre application of dairy manure. However, a greater percent of the P in most dairy manures is water-soluble. We found that from 17 to 66 % of the P in semi-solid dairy manur...|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{measurements}} {{carried out}} in {{the central part of the}} Venice lagoon during the season of the highest macroalgal production, at the beginning of June 1987, showed that 85 km 2, corresponding to 65 % of the examined area, were covered by remarkable amounts of nitrophile macroalgae. Total macroalgal biomass was 546 900 tons, accounting for 17 679, 1911 and 170 tons of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. The annual net primary production, calculated from the maximum production/biomass (P/B) ratio determined in a hypertrophic area of the central lagoon, was estimated to be 866 160 - 1154 880 <b>tons</b> (<b>wet</b> wt). Therefore, in Spring-Summer, macroalgae recycled 78 - 104 % and 38 - 51 % of the total annual nitrogen and phosphorus which entered the central lagoon. Phytoplankton standing crop appeared negligible in most of the studied area. High chlorophyll-a concentrations were only measured near the Porto Marghera industrial zone where macroalgae were almost absent; in the area between the islands of S. Angelo and Gidecca, where the water depth was > 1 m; and in the area facing the island of Lido used by the Municipality of Venice as a test area for algal removal experiments. Based on both space and time measurements, nanoplankton accounted for about 80 % of the total phytoplankton...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBiomass {{residues}} in plantation {{farms and}} process industries still have valuable materials {{and can be}} recycled as other materials. Gunung Madu Plantation (GMP) in Lampung Province, Indonesia where this study was observed had used bagasse as mulch 80 <b>tons</b> (<b>wet</b> weight) per hectare. This study observed the effect of tillage and bagasse much on soil microbes in sugarcane plantation. Each treatment was {{used in conjunction with}} or without bagasse mulch in a split-plot experimental design. Previous study showed bagasse mulch had increased litter fungal biomass and communities in the soil. However soil microbial community structure has not been comprehensively investigated. Quinone profile method was used to analyze the community structure amended with bagasse mulch in the sugarcane plantation. Quinone profile method reflectively estimated the microbial biomass and the diversity. The no-tillage with bagasse mulch had the highest microbial biomass (1. 026 μmol kg- 1 dry soil) compare to the no-tillage without bagasse mulch, the conventional tillage with bagasse mulch and the conventional tillage without bagasse mulch. The Diversity index (DQ) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was also the highest in the no-tillage amended with bagasse mulch. Therefore mulch treatment in combination with no-tillage is an effective residue management of biomass residue to improve soil quality...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIndonesia {{needs at}} least 1, 100 tons of {{alginate}} {{per year for}} various food and non-food industries with a value of about 420, 000 US Dollars. These needs are met through imports from aboard. The raw materials for alginate, namely brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) are very abundant in Indonesian coastal zones, but its stock level is not yet known. This study aims: to explore the biomass of brown seaweeds along the coastal areas of Bitung-Bentena, North Sulawesi Province by mapping their habitat, distribution and density using the effective and efficient tool of satellite remote sensing; and to compile preliminary results {{on the quality of}} alginate extracted from brown seaweeds. Result show that based on the isocluster analysis of Landsat- 7 ETM+ and field sampling, we successfully classified 6 different habitats in the reef flats of Bitung-Bentena with map which had accuracy of 73. 6 %. The total area of brown seaweeds was approximately 127. 1 ha. Meanwhile, from 53 field transects, there were 6 species of brown seaweed with an average density for all species of 690. 4 grams/m 2. Thus, the biomass of brown seaweed was 2, 133. 5 <b>tons</b> <b>wet</b> weight, equal to 29. 9 tons of alginate. This study proves that satellite remote sensing is an effective and efficient tool for such kind of works, and must be continued along the entire of Indonesian coastal zones. In this study, the preliminary results on extracting alginate from brown seaweed are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Farmers in {{the villages}} always face the same {{problem of how to}} reduce the {{moisture}} content of paddy harvest during harvest and postharvest time, especially in wet season. At the farm level, the grain quality is poor and alternative drying using kerosene fuel is very costly. The objective of this research was to design and evaluate the technical and economical performance of drying paddy using an equipment known as "ABC" dryer. The dryer uses paddy husk as fuel. The research was conducted at Research Institute for Rice over three years (1993 / 94 - 1995 / 96). The result showed that the "ABC" type dryer could reduce the moisture content of 5 <b>tons</b> <b>wet</b> paddy from 22. 25 % to 15. 03 % in 9 hours or an average drying rate of 1. 05 % moisture content per hour, with drying cost of Rp 18 kg- 1. Reducing the moisture content further to 11. 83 % needed 16 hours or average drying rate 0. 82 % hour- 1, with drying cost almost doubled (Rp 32 kg- 1). These costs are far below that of kerosene drying, i. e., Rp 30 kg- 1 and Rp 60 kg- 1 to reach moisture content of 15. 03 % and 11. 83 %, respectively. Budget analysis showed that the B/C ratio were 1. 57 and 1. 84 and the IRR are above 41. 26 % and 47. 42 % to reach moisture contentsof 15. 03 % and 11. 83 %, respectively. The break even points of "ABC" dryer were 130 and 60 tons, respectively. The milling test showed that the milling rice from the "ABC" dryer had better recovery (milling rendement) and rice quality (head rice) was higher than that of from sun-drying...|$|R
40|$|Seaweed {{has been}} {{collected}} in northern New England for agricultural purposes {{since the first}} settlers arrived over three hundred years ago. Today seaweed is still gathered along the coast, but the techniques used and technologies employed, have drastically altered the industry. While people once gathered seaweed by hand from open boats, today vacuum powered mechanical harvesters are frequently utilized and the seaweed gathered is taken to specialized processing plants. It is here that the dried material {{is transformed into a}} variety of products, such as liquid fertilizer and animal feed. One person operating a mechanical harvester is capable of harvesting twenty-two thousand pounds of seaweed in one day, for which harvesters are generally paid 20 - 30 per <b>wet</b> <b>ton.</b> Rockweed, the dominant intertidal seaweed on the Northern Atlantic coast, takes two and a half to three years to recover to preharvest density, depending on the intensity of the harvest and productivity of the site. The super-efficient harvesting methods that are now commonplace in Maine can be ecologically damaging when practiced irresponsibly. Members of the scientific community have voiced their concerns about the effect of harvesting of seaweed on the many juvenile fish species that rely on seaweed as a source of food and habitat. When it is overharvested, as it has been in sections of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the marine ecosystem as a whole suffers. Interest in harvesting Maine 2 ̆ 7 s rockweed resource on a large-scale commercial basis has increased in recent years, particularly from Canadian processors. Local concern over the impacts of unregulated harvests has grown along with the increase in demand for seaweed. Very little is known about how harvesting impacts the long-term health of large beds of seaweeds and the marine creatures and plants associated with them. As Christopher Lobban has noted, 2 ̆ 2 [sleaweeds do not merely influence the habitat-to a large extent they are the habitat. 2 ̆ 2 Anyone who has observed a healthy submerged rockweed community will attest to its forest like appearance. These vast underwater forests provide shelter and habitat to many species of juvenile fish and crustaceans, including many commercially valuable species. A recent Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) report identifies rockweed growing low in the intertidal zone as a nursery for young lobsters. Seaweed provides not only shelter, but also food to a variety of fish, birds, and crustaceans. Seaweed is a valuable primary producer, and its place {{at the bottom of the}} food chain makes it a vital component of a healthy marine ecosystem. The recent friction in Maine among commercial seaweed harvesters, private shorefront landowners, and commercial fishermen boiled over in the summer of 2000, when Acadian Seaplants of Darmouth, Nova Scotia began advertising for seaweed harvesters to work in Maine, particularly in the Cobscook Bay area of Washington County. More than six hundred Washington County residents launched an unsuccessful petition effort to convince the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) Commissioner George LaPointe to ban commercial harvesting in Cobscook Bay until research could determine what a large commercial harvest would do to the ecosystem of the bay. The majority of coastal property owners live in quiet acceptance of the fact that fishermen may legally use their shorefront property, but many resent the harvesting of seaweed growing on their land. These property owners feel that the loss of the vegetation detracts from their aesthetic enjoyment of the property and is an abrogation of their inherent right to exclude others from their land. Those of this persuasion argue that seaweed harvesters have no more right to remove seaweed from their intertidal zone than they would to harvest timber growing on their upland property. Harvesters, however, feel that they are entitled to profit from the resource since it grows in the sea, which is held in trust by the state as a resource common to all. Some argue that the gathering of seaweed falls within the definition of 2 ̆ 2 fishing 2 ̆ 2 for public trust doctrine purposes, and that the public is therefore allowed to traverse the intertidal zone in pursuit of seaplants. Harvesters can point to historical records showing that it has been gathered for centuries in Maine and elsewhere, and argue that they are, at the very least, entitled to an easement by prescription in certain localities. The pressures on Maine 2 ̆ 7 s seaweed resource are likely to increase. In addition to the local entrepreneurs that are gaining interest in the seaweed industry, commercial harvesting companies located in maritime Canada are looking to Maine as a plentiful source of seaweed. Acadian Seaplants has already begun hiring independent contractors to gather seaweed for export to processing plants in Canada. If the State of Maine deems it necessary to expand its cursory regulation of this resource, the time to do so is now. The competing interests in seaweed all stem from the question of ownership and the right to exclude. This article will analyze the property rights scheme in Maine to determine whether the resource is privately owned or open to public use, and whether, and how, the State of Maine could regulate its exploitation in order to ensure a sustainable harvest. These issues will be examined in light of Maine 2 ̆ 7 s existing legal framework including the public trust doctrine, the profit a prendre concept, pertinent case law, current agency regulatory regimes, and scholarly articles. To a significant degree, the legal arguments revolve around the characterization of seaweed as a certain type of property. The property characterization debate in turn is influenced by the physiology of the resource and the means by which it grows. Section II will familiarize the reader with the physiology and habitat of seaweeds, specifically those indigenous to the Maine coast. Section MI discusses the uses of seaweed both historically and in modern times. Section IV presents an overview of the public trust doctrine in Maine as a framework for the analysis in Section V of who exactly owns seaweeds off shore, on land, and in the intertidal zone. Section VI contemplates seaweed as a resource governed by the concept of profit a prendre. Maine 2 ̆ 7 s statutory regulation of the seaweed harvest is the subject of Section VII. Finally, this comment concludes that the property interests in seaweed vary with its location, but that live seaweeds growing in the intertidal zone should be considered the property of the upland owner...|$|R
