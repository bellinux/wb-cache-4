Booster explains to Kord that he has led a good life, married and had a son (Rip Hunter), and begins to age rapidly from time travel radiation sickness. Rip intervenes and forces the New 52 Booster to take his father into the raw chronal field contained at Vanishing Point; pre-Flashpoint Booster's body is destroyed, but he is reborn as <b>Waverider,</b> the all-knowing cosmic time traveller. <b>Waverider</b> then emerges on Telos in the final issue of Convergence along with the New 52 Booster and Goldstar to bring back Brainiac, and they convince him to save the Multiverse from its imminent destruction. Brainiac then sends Zero Hour Parallax and pre-Flashpoint Superman back to the conclusion of the Crisis on Infinite Earths to avert the original crisis event, and this results in many of the classic worlds of the Multiverse being reborn in their modern forms.|$|E

In the hallucination, Oliver finds himself back at Queen Manor, having never gotten on The Queen's Gambit, where {{he is about to}} be married to Laurel Lance, both his parents are alive, and Diggle is the Hood. Oliver begins seeing flashes of his former life, as do Sara, Ray, Diggle, and Thea, making them realize what the Dominators have done to them. They decide to try and escape, but their attempt is blocked by each of their own enemy: Malcolm Merlyn, Deathstroke and one of his Mirakuru soldiers (who killed Ray's fiancée Anna Loring), Damien Darhk and his H.I.V.E. soldiers (including Andy Diggle). The adversaries are all defeated, and the captives are able to escape, resulting in them waking up inside the Dominators ship. Escaping in a shuttle, they are rescued by Nate Heywood, who pilots the time ship <b>Waverider.</b> Meanwhile, Felicity, Curtis Holt and Cisco try to hack into the Dominators' mainframe using a piece of their technology, recovering a necessary device with the help of Barry and Kara to locate the captives. Aboard the <b>Waverider,</b> Ray deduces that the Dominators were gathering information from their minds about metahumans, using the hallucination as a distraction, to help them complete a special [...] "weapon". Elsewhere, the Dominator mothership heads towards Earth.|$|E

During this period (1960-1965) at least one <b>Waverider</b> was tested at the Woomera Test Range. There were rumours that free-flight tests were also conducted at this time.

50|$|<b>Waverider</b> is {{a fictional}} superhero in the DC Comics universe, a time {{traveler}} who was {{merged with the}} time stream. <b>Waverider</b> was created by Archie Goodwin and Dan Jurgens. The first version of the character, Matthew Ryder, first appeared in Armageddon 2001 #1 (May 1991).|$|E
50|$|<b>Waverider</b> {{and various}} heroes who he {{gathered}} defeated a demonic being called Abraxis. Later, while <b>Waverider</b> was {{traveling through the}} time stream, he encountered a 2030 version of himself as Matthew Ryder, who was still a regular human (since Monarch's future reign had been erased). Following this, {{the two of them}} joined the Linear Men, a group that contained time-traveling beings who protected the time stream. Despite the Linear Men's policy of non-intervention in the timeline - to the point that <b>Waverider,</b> was discouraged from preventing Superman's death during his first battle with Doomsday - <b>Waverider</b> came to Superman's aid when he discovered that Doomsday had returned to life and was now working with the Cyborg Superman. Recognizing the danger of Doomsday's existence, <b>Waverider</b> showed Superman a detailed vision of the past to explain the circumstances of Doomsday's origin as a genetically engineered being capable of evolving to overcome anything that proved capable of killing him. <b>Waverider</b> also discovered that Doomsday's hatred of Superman was due to Doomsday's traumatic origins on Krypton leaving him with a deeply rooted hatred of Kryptonians. The two heroes seemingly defeated the monster by taking him to the end of time, where the imprisoned Doomsday was destroyed by entropy as the universe itself collapsed. Later, during Zero Hour, <b>Waverider</b> was killed by Extant, who had evolved from Monarch. However, the human Matthew Ryder was still alive, and was shortly thereafter contacted by Metron. Metron told Matthew that he had to become <b>Waverider,</b> and that {{he was the only one}} who could use time travel to save the universe. Matthew was then transformed into a new version of <b>Waverider,</b> and took the role his previous self did: helping a select group of heroes defeat Extant and Parallax's effort to recreate time the way that Extant and Parallax wanted it by triggering their own Big Bang with the aid of Damage.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Waverider</b> {{uses his}} {{abilities}} {{to look into}} the future of various characters, he cannot pinpoint who will become Monarch. But eventually, <b>Waverider</b> accidentally comes into physical contact with Captain Atom, unleashing a storm of temporal energy that opens a gate to the future through which Monarch emerges. Monarch, it seems, has been monitoring Waverider's every move in the past ever since he left the future, and merely waiting for the perfect time to travel back and stop <b>Waverider</b> from erasing Monarch from existence.|$|E
