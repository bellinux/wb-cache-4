60|$|Such was the {{condition}} of Rome during {{the second year of}} the Triumvirate, in which Cæsar was Consul and prepared the way for the powers which he afterward exercised. Cicero <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his call; and therefore, as we are told, Clodius was let loose upon him. As he <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Cæsar's call, it was necessary that he should be suppressed, and Clodius, notwithstanding all constitutional difficulties--nay, impossibilities--was made Tribune of the people. Things had now so far advanced with a Cæsar that a Cicero who <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his call must be disposed of after some fashion.|$|R

5|$|Article 33 of the BSAC {{charter of}} 1889 gave the British {{government}} {{the right to}} alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years. So it was widely anticipated by all sections of southern African political opinion after 1910 that the BSAC's administration <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an end in 1914. Yet the BSAC remained in place.|$|E

5|$|But at {{some point}} in 1972, family {{friendly}} programming began being interspersed with (and was eventually replaced by) “blue movies”, such as Swedish Fly Girls. The chain <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be known for its generally risque material. In 1981, prints of both Caligula and Dracula Sucks were confiscated from multiple Towne locations, and the company was sued by the Government of Alberta under obscenity laws.|$|E
5|$|McQuesten {{also sought}} out the {{economic}} opportunity that came with linking Toronto to Detroit and New York by divided roadways with interchanges at major crossroads, Although he no longer served as Minister of Highways by the onset of World War II, his ambitious plans <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fruition in the following decades as Highways 400, 401, 402, 403 (between Woodstock and Hamilton) and 405.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan would now attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, which <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{be known}} as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{be known as}} Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along {{the valley of the}} Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva {{and asked her to}} go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E
5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E

5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fulfill this same role.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Lady Charlotte Fermor {{was born}} on 14 February 1725, the second eldest {{daughter}} of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys. The growing family <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> include ten children: four sons and six daughters. Lord and Lady Pomfret held various court appointments during their lifetimes; the earl served as Master of the Horse to Queen Caroline while his wife was a Lady of the Bedchamber.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade Norway. Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a stand {{in the northern part}} of the country, Norway also fell. The invasion of Norway was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be seen by the British as a dire portent.|$|E
