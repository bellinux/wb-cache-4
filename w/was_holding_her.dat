25|$|The Queen {{died in the}} {{presence}} of her eldest son, the Prince Regent, who <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> hand as she sat in an armchair at the family's country retreat, Dutch House in Surrey (now known as Kew Palace). She was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later.

25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was to say he was in his workshop, while Andersen was to say he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E

25|$|Starkweather {{chose to}} be extradited to Nebraska and he and Fugate arrived there in late January 1958. He {{believed}} that either state would have executed him. He was not aware that the Governor of Wyoming {{at the time was}} an opponent of the death penalty. Starkweather first claimed he had kidnapped Fugate and that she {{had nothing to do with}} the murders; however, he changed his story several times, finally testifying at Fugate's trial that she was a willing participant. Fugate has always maintained that Starkweather <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> hostage by threatening to kill her family, claiming she was unaware they were already dead. Judge Harry A. Spencer did not believe Fugate was held hostage by Starkweather, as she had had numerous opportunities to escape. When Starkweather was first brought in to the Nebraska penitentiary he stated that he believed that he was supposed to die and that if he was to be executed, then Fugate should be too.|$|E

Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Doggett phones Scully to {{tell her}} that Kobold claims Richman is at an old marina near Annandale, Virginia. Scully drives there, but is {{attacked}} by Richman. When Doggett and Reyes arrive, they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Richman dead. Scully explains that he <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> <b>her</b> at gunpoint until they arrived, then shot himself. After Scully's lecture to FBI cadets, Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and got away with it. Explaining that the word [...] "Dae/moni/cus" [...] was code for the chosen victims' names, in a game Kobold devised to culminate in his eventual escape from the asylum. That the [...] "demons" [...] angle was merely to get the X-files' involvement and that they were all thoroughly [...] "checkmated" [...] by Kodold. Reyes, though accepting of Doggett's theories, is still nevertheless disconcerted with the true feeling of evil that she experienced, and believes Doggett was equally out of sorts because, though loath to admit it, he too felt its presence.|$|E
