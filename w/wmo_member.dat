50|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{communications}} between countries following the Chernobyl disaster in the Spring of 1986, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other international organizations to arrange for early warning messages about nuclear accidents to be transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). In addition some <b>WMO</b> <b>member</b> countries that lacked extensive forecasting capability requested that specialized pollutant transport and dispersion forecasts be provided during these emergencies. As a result, during 1989 Meteo-France (MF), Environment Canada (EC) and the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO) were all set up as RSMCs under interim arrangements between the WMO and the IAEA. Under these arrangements Meteo-France provided global coverage with the UKMO as the backup center until each WMO region had at least two RSMCs for transport model products. The need for the rationalization of transport and dispersion forecasts became even more apparent during the oil fire emergency after the Gulf War, when several organizations provided personnel on the ground with predictions of the smoke plume behaviour which were often misleading as there was no existing and well-recognized system to sort out the predictions from less experienced sources.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} loss of historical meteorological, climatological and hydrological data {{in many parts}} of the world is an issue that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has been addressing for more than three decades. It has become a major concern in hydrology where for more than two decades, hydrological observing networks worldwide have been on the decline. Significantly, most countries have at least some need for data rescue. Although the reasons are varied, most fall within two general categories: record deterioration and risk of catastrophic loss. The World Meteorological Organization, through its Hydrology and Water Resources Programme, has been supporting the efforts of Members in data rescue activities. In addition, in 2006, it sponsored a survey of <b>WMO</b> <b>Members</b> that documented significant international concern about the state of historical data records and the need for data rescue activities in almost all countries. The survey also demonstrated the need among many Members for a set of guidelines specifying procedures for implementing hydrological data rescue. The current publication is designed to meet that need. These guidelines review the rationale for hydrological data rescue, the benefits to be derived therefrom, appropriate rescue methods, sound data management practices as well as data management systems, procedures for securing rescued data far into the future and for safeguarding data through storage in an international database. As with all WMO guides, this one provides a range of options so that Members can choose the most appropriate to their unique circumstances. We hope that the hydrological community will find these guidelines of help in its efforts to secure and preserve its data holdings over the long term...|$|R

In the report, different approaches are identified with the objective to define these criteria, and the following method was selected as the most appropriate one: Time evolution of selected statistical parameters reported in the different IOM international radiosonde comparisons organized between 1984 and 2005. A set of performance criteria is proposed together with a way how to extract the corresponding values from the IOM reports and to present the results. The WMO international radiosonde intercomparisons have played a key role in the improvement of these measurements. These results have been used by manufactures with the goal to improve their products. The report enables to monitor these technology improvements. I wish to express my sincere gratitude and that of CIMO to the authors of this report, namely C. Bower (NOAA, USA), B. Calpini and P. Jeannet (MeteoSwiss, Switzerland) for their remarkable work done in elaborating this report. I am confident that <b>WMO</b> <b>Members</b> as well as radiosonde designers and manufactures will find this report very useful. It will contribute to further improvement of upperair measurements...|$|R
40|$|I {{recall a}} time in Jharkhand, India in the forest town of Chandwa, sitting with a {{selfhelp}} group under a mahua tree. We ate the mahua's large raisin-like berries, soon to be turned into country alcohol, while {{a few of the}} women recounted their story. A wellmeaning organisation (WMO) had come to empower this self-help group, which had formed on its own about a year earlier. The WMO advised the group that its members would have more money if they were to pickle and pack their garden harvests to sell to customers in Calcutta. The organisation helped the group with recipes, with bottling and labeling. For several weeks the WMO and the women applied themselves day and night to the task. Somewhere along the way, the WMO lost the group's savings and never did find a market for the chutney. The women pointed to a houseful of jars as evidence. Invincible, the group forged ahead, without the benefit of the <b>WMO.</b> Group <b>members</b> met each week, deposited cash savings into a box, then lent the cash to one another for emergency needs. The group fund began to accumulate once again. Some members had helped other new groups form in the village and they too began to increase thei...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the utility of remote sensing (RS) using meteorological satellites sensors and spatial interpolation (SI) of data from meteorological stations, for the prediction of spatial variation in monthly climate across continental Africa in 1990. Information from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites was used to estimate land surface temperature (LST) and atmospheric moisture. Cold cloud duration (CCD) data derived from the High Resolution Radiometer (HRR) onboard the European Meteorological Satellite programme's (EUMETSAT) Meteosat satellite series were also used as a RS proxy measurement of rainfall. Temperature, atmospheric moisture and rainfall surfaces were independently derived from SI of measurements from the World Meteorological Organization (<b>WMO)</b> <b>member</b> stations of Africa. These meteorological station data were then used to test the accuracy of each methodology, so that the appropriateness of the two techniques for epidemiological research could be compared. SI was a more accurate predictor of temperature, whereas RS provided a better surrogate for rainfall; both were equally accurate at predicting atmospheric moisture. The implications of these results for mapping short and long-term climate change and hence their potential for the study and control of disease vectors are considered. Taking into account logistic and analytical problems, there were no clear conclusions regarding the optimality of either technique, but there was considerable potential for synerg...|$|E

30|$|Recognizing {{that the}} {{benefits}} to society of an IRI could only be achieved if the knowledge and capacity to utilize experimental predictions (as well as understanding of current climatic conditions) existed beyond the traditional scientific community, NOAA/OGP had initiated a series of pilot projects {{beginning in the early}} 1990 s. This effort was housed within a research arm of the agency, the Office of Global Programs (OGP), to ensure that it was guided by the same rigorous standards of project development, review and implementation utilized in the physical science programs. It was integrated with OGP’s physical and social science research programs in order to generate the most usable interdisciplinary outcomes; recognized by as innovative, credible scientific research, undertaken in a realm uninfluenced by some of the high level, controversial international climate negotiations underway at the time. NOAA’s suite of activities consisted of the regional Pilot Program for the Application of Climate Forecasts, and the Regional Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs) in which regional-specific forecasts and the results of the Pilot Program research were presented. Each one was designed and undertaken in conjunction {{with a wide range of}} partners including, inter alia, the US Agency for International Development’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA); the NOAA/CPC); the World Meteorological Organization (<b>WMO)</b> and its <b>member</b> National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) in some countries; the World Bank; several regional research networks endorsed by the 1992 UNCED focused on the Americas, Africa and Asia (e.g., the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, the European Network for Research in Global Change); the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center.|$|R
