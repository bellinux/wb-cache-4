Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured.

This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
500|$|Building a good {{relationship}} with MacArthur meant getting past Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff. Brett advised Kenney that [...] "a showdown early in the game with Sutherland might clarify the entire atmosphere." [...] Sutherland, who had a civil pilot's license, had taken to issuing detailed instructions to the Allied Air Forces. This was more than simply a turf battle; to many airmen, it {{was a part of the}} ongoing battle for an independent air force that they had long been advocating. At one point, Kenney drew a dot on a plain page of paper and told Sutherland, [...] "the dot represents <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about air operations, the entire rest of the paper what I know." [...] Sutherland backed down, and would henceforth let Kenney run the Allied Air Forces without interference. It did not follow, however, that MacArthur would invariably accept Kenney's advice.|$|E
500|$|Lior Philips from Consequence of Sound found {{influences}} of Gaga's [...] "dance musicality" [...] in [...] "The Cure", {{especially in the}} [...] "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto". Comparing the track to songs by OneRepublic, Philips complimented {{the simplicity of the}} verses, writing that it [...] "intensifies the mood". Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood states that [...] "The Cure" [...] is [...] "an intriguing midtempo pop-soul jam", with [...] "synthetic textures", and [...] "very Madonna circa 'Human Nature'". Amy Mackelden of Marie Claire called it a [...] "synth-pop masterpiece that will be stuck in your head from the second you hear it" [...] and further wrote: [...] "The lyrics are super uplifting and relatable, especially as the chorus features the positive refrain, 'No matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I'll fix you with my love.'" [...] Ian Monroe from V praised the song for its lyrics and called it [...] "the song of the summer".|$|E

John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E

Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said.

The first half details an account of ancient history, [...] "even your junior high school social studies teacher would blush over", with the second half containing a narrative where Ocean serves as Cleopatra’s pimp but through years of working together, he eventually {{falls in love with}} her. Through the [...] "unwritten bylaws of their profession", however, his love is no match for the [...] "rules of the game which were established long before he or she rose to power." [...] The narrative of [...] "Pyramids" [...] was inspired by real events in Ocean's life. When the singer lived in Los Angeles, he lived alongside pimps, and in an interview the singer mused that [...] "it was fantasy built off that dynamic … but you can only write <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> to a point."

500|$|Ripken {{received}} the third base {{job for the}} Orioles in 1982 when the team traded DeCinces {{before the start of}} the season. He homered in his very first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin the season; his batting average was [...]118 through May 1. Ripken looked for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided by advice from Reggie Jackson: [...] "Just know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you can do, not what everybody else tells you to do." [...] After that, Ripken hit well for the rest of the season. On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998. On July 1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third baseman who could hit. Weaver said, [...] "You never know. Rip might be a great shortstop." [...] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. Aided by Ripken, the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers on the final day of the season.|$|E

Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride.

500|$|Steven Moffat {{left his}} job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost {{and changes in the}} {{executive}} structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series. As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead. That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: [...] "I don't think you have an alternative to writing about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> You've no life experience to go on other than your own. Even if you're writing something you think is entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close to your own experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability." ...|$|E

Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E
500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
