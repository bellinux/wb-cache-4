5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system.

5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual.

Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms.

Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> person.

Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E
