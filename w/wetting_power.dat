40|$|The {{relative}} efficiencies {{of some of}} {{the common}} wetting agents have been determined by measuring the surface tension of five-minute-old surfaces of the solutions using the ring method in a modified form. Aqueous solutions giving a surface tension of 37 dynes per cm. may be considered to have good wetting properties. It is found that <b>wetting</b> <b>power</b> is not necessarily associated with detergent and emulsifying properties. Salts greatly increase <b>wetting</b> <b>power.</b> Bivalent cations are more effective than univalent cations in increasing <b>wetting</b> <b>power.</b> A moderate degree of hardness in water employed in preparing solutions of wetting agents may be of advantage in the textile industry. The maximum bubble pressure method is shown to be unsuitable for the measurement of surface tension of solutions which show a variation with time. A rough idea of the order of wetting efficiencies of wetting agents can however be obtained by measuring the surface tension of a five-second-old surface by this method. ...|$|E

These measurements combined with the surface tension of the aqueous solutions give an exact idea of the wetting characteristics of the solutions.

It is shown that small quantities of nekal BX greatly improve the spreading qualities of oils on polar surfaces. The spreading coefficients of nekal BX solutions {{are found to be}} negative even at the highest concentrations tried. It is therefore suggested that the wetting takes place by penetration and not by spreading. Thus, the adhesion tension of the aqueous solutions against oil gives a more correct measure of the <b>wetting</b> <b>power.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|After {{using the}} IL 2 as an {{additive}} in anodization, {{we have also}} tried {{to take advantage of}} its properties in the characterization of the system. In Fig. 2 b, the liquid CAs θ measured on the APA surfaces described in Figs. 12 a have been reported. The filled squares represent the CAs obtained with DI-water as the wetting phase. One can see that all the respective APA films look rather hydrophilic (θwater < 90 °). Most samples showed quite similar values (θwater ~ 29 °), whereas only the sample with smaller pores showed a significantly higher θwater. The reason is probably that for that sample the pores were too small to be filled by the water, and the drop was actually sitting on a mixed APA–air interface [48]. In practical terms, the water “probe” did not allow for high enough resolution to sense the smallest APA pores. A similar resolution limit affected also the topographic measurements by AFM, as observed in the RMS roughness plot of Fig. 2 a (see the previous subsection for discussion). In Fig. 2 b, the open squares report instead the CAs obtained with a c = 10 % v/v solution of IL 2 in the DI-water wetting phase, θIL 2. In this case, the CA values were all quite similar to each other, and lower than for the bare water, θIL 2 ~ 16 °. This means that the IL 2 solution had higher <b>wetting</b> <b>power</b> than water, and could wet even the smallest APA pores. Actually a similar behavior is expected from any IL, which should work such as a highly polar solvent that can easily penetrate voids of a few nanometer diameter only [3]. Therefore, IL 2 can also be used successfully for this kind of characterization of the porous APA surface morphology.|$|E

40|$|Being a {{semi-arid}} {{country with}} limited fresh water resources {{and also a}} fossil fuel based energy intensive country, South Africa encounters the added pressure of allocating limited water resources. Roughly 90 % of electricity in South Africa is generated from coal fired power plants that are located in semi-arid areas and {{use a combination of}} wet and dry cooling techniques. The paper aims to forecast water usage within coal based electricity generation in order to facilitate water management in water deficient parts of the country. Some of the older return to service (RTS) power plants which have been brought back to operation due to electricity shortages are water intensive and are located in water constrained water management areas. These power plants should be phased out gradually and replaced by higher efficiency dry cooled power plants - that are currently under construction - by the year 2020. Total water requirements could reach 370 gigalitres by the year 2021 from current levels of 360 gigalitres. Depending on the retirement of inefficient power plants, total water usage can be reduced by roughly 14 %. Results show that management of water resources in the electricity generation sector can result in informed water allocations within water management areas. Proposed gradual retirement of the RTS fleet could result in a savings of 15 % of the forecasted shortfall of 234 gigalitres by the year 2025. The deficit in electricity generation output caused by the retirement of the RTS fleet will have to be compensated by the simultaneous commissioning and operation of new build power plants. Such measures will provide much required water relief to water constrained water management areas. Overall increases in water usage until 2035 can be minimised if inefficient <b>wet</b> cooled <b>power</b> plants are gradually retired and if dry cooled power plants are more prominent.
