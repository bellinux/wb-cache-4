40|$|Abstract. For about 70 years, cold {{roll forming}} machine {{has been used to}} make {{products}} whose cross section are uniform in the longitudinal direction. Products formed by this machine are used as construction materials, aircraft structural parts, automotive body parts, oil pipelines and so on. Research and development on production technology to make products with higher quality and higher dimensional accuracy has been carried out. Furthermore, analytical research using FEM method has been vigorously done. On the other hand, in accordance with the development of computer control system combined with CPU technology in recent years, research on development of the flexible cold {{roll forming machine}} that can form products with varying width in the longitudinal direction has been carried out in Japan and Europe (1) 〜(4). The new cold roll forming machine combines the normal cold roll forming technology with computer-control technology, making it possible to form the long sized products whose cross sections vary in width. In 2011, we presented a paper that described the design method of flexible cold roll forming machine and the shape defects caused by this machine. In this paper, the behaviors of surface strains occurred in forming flexible section, which are measured by using resistance <b>wire</b> <b>type</b> strain <b>gauges,</b> are described from the view point of making clear the cause of occurrence of shape defect...|$|R
40|$|Three {{magnetic}} powder cores and one ferrite core, {{which are}} commonly used in inductor and transformer design for switch mode power supplies, were selected for investigation at cryogenic temperatures. The powder cores are Molypermalloy Core (MPC), High Flux Core (HFC), and Kool Mu Core (KMC). The performance of four inductors utilizing these cores has been evaluated {{as a function of}} temperature from 20 C to - 180 C. All cores were wound with the same <b>wire</b> <b>type</b> and <b>gauge</b> to obtain equal values of inductance at room temperature. Each inductor was evaluated in terms of its inductance, quality (Q) factor, resistance, and dynamic hysteresis characteristics (B-H loop) as a function of temperature and frequency. Both sinusoidal and square wave excitations were used in these investigations. Measured data obtained on the inductance showed that both the MPC and the HFC cores maintain a constant inductance value, whereas with the KMC and ferrite core hold a steady value in inductance with frequency but decrease as temperature is decreased. All cores exhibited dependency, with varying degrees, in their quality factor and resistance on test frequency and temperature. Except for the ferrite, all cores exhibited good stability in the investigated properties with temperature as well as frequency. Details of the experimental procedures and test results are presented and discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} occurs when {{refrigerant}} fluids wick inside the insulation of thermocouple wires through a compressor's casing feedthrough and then leak into the adjacent disconnect box outside the casing. Leaking fluids create an unfavorable situation inside the disconnect box and may contaminate the fluids. To address this problem, NASA Lewis Research Center s Manufacturing Engineering Division developed a customized hermetic feedthrough for {{a bank of}} Worthington compressors. In these compressors, bearing temperatures are measured by internal thermocouples embedded in bearings located inside the compressor casings. The thermocouple wires need to be routed outside the casing and read at another location. These wires are short and are terminated to a disconnect strip inside the casing. The bearings operate at about 170 F, but because the casing is filled with R 12 refrigerant oil, the casing has a maximum temperature of about 100 F. The operating conditions of these compressors {{permit the use of}} an epoxy that is compatible with the R 12 fluid. The desired finished product is a stainless steel tube that has been filled solid with epoxy after thermocouple wires bonded and sealed by epoxy have been inserted through its length. Shrink tubing extends from both ends of the tube. The process that was developed to isolate the thermocouple wires from the R 12 fluid follows. For this application, use an 8 -in. -long piece of 0. 500 -in. 304 stainless steel tube with six pairs of 24 -gauge stranded, PTFE-insulated (polytetrafluoroethylene) <b>type</b> "T" thermocouple <b>wires</b> for each feedthrough. Use shrink tubing to strain relief the insulated wires at their exit from the stainless steel tube. Cut the wire to length and identify the location of the stainless steel tube sleeve with masking tape. Then, remove the outer insulation from a 2 -in. section of wire that will be inside the tube, and carefully strip to bare wire a 1 -in. section {{in the middle of the}} section with the outer insulation removed. For an effective seal, the epoxy must penetrate between the strands when stranded conductors are used. Make the seal with epoxy bond on the bare wire. The bare wire must be encapsulated with a thin layer of the epoxy that leaves only a very low profile. These encapsulated wires must cure before the assembly can be continued. Then, inspect the cured wires for complete encapsulation before going to the next step. Insert the wires in the stainless steel tube and orient them so that the epoxied stripped sections are staggered within the tube; then, apply shrink tubing to one end of the cleaned wires, positioning it inside the edge of the tube. The small gaps between the wires on the other end will be used to inject the epoxy into the tube. Let the epoxy cure inside the tube, free of any voids. Then, continue to fill the tube until the entire 8 -in. length is nearly filled, allowing room for the other strain-relieving shrink tubing. Since this first design, the process has been adjusted to fit many needs and situations. Customized feedthroughs have been assembled from various <b>wire</b> <b>types,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>gauges,</b> and/or stainless steel tube passages. The fittings selected to mount these feedthroughs allow their use in other areas, such as pressure or vacuum systems...|$|R

The data for the amplitude ratio and phase angle are correlated to within 10 percent with the theoretical predictions of Fralick and Forney (1991).

It is found that a large bead size, however, will increase the amplitude ratio at low frequencies but decreas the natural frequency of the wire.

40|$|A {{combination}} of x-ray diffraction analysis, with mechanical testing in tension and bending {{has been used}} to investigate he metallurgical structures and mechanical properties for as-received and heat-treated stainless steel orthodontic wires. Two different proprietary <b>wire</b> <b>types</b> were selected, having a wide range in cross-sectional dimensions: 0. 016 - 0. 030 -, and 0. 050 - or 0. 051 -inch diameters, and 0. 017 × 0. 025 -inch rectangular specimens. Heat treatments were performed for 10 minutes in air at temperatures of 700 °, 900 °, and 1100 ° F. The x-ray diffraction patterns showed that the as-received 0. 016 -inch diameter and 0. 017 × 0. 025 -inch wires of both proprietary types consisted of a two-phase structure containing a martensitic phase along with the austenitic phase. This duplex structure was converted entirely to austenite with heat treatment for one <b>wire</b> <b>type,</b> but persisted after heat treatment for the other <b>wire</b> <b>type.</b> The largest diameter, 0. 050 - or 0. 051 -inch, <b>wires</b> of both <b>types</b> were single-phase austenitic structure for both the as-received and heat-treated conditions. Evidence of substantial preferred crystallographic orientation or texturing in these orthodontic wires was also found by x-ray diffraction. As in our previous studies, the modulus of elasticity in bending was significantly less than the value obtained in tension for only the smaller cross-sectional wires. The 0. 05 radian flexural yield strength correlated more closely with the 0. 2 % offset yield strength in tension than with the yield strength for 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % permanent. offsets.
