5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do what I thought was the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E
25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to understand, about that experience <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
500|$|MacMillan {{testified that}} for the {{duration}} of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee [...] "from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not break." [...] She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.|$|E
60|$|I {{caught a}} glimpse of Issus leaning far forward upon her throne, her hideous countenance {{distorted}} in a horrid grimace of hate and rage, in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distinguish an expression of fear. It was that face that inspired me to the thing that followed.|$|R

500|$|Fretilin {{boycotted the}} meeting in protest of APODETI's presence; representatives of UDT and APODETI complained {{that this was an}} effort to obstruct the decolonisation process. In his 1987 memoir Funu: The Unfinished Saga of East Timor, Fretilin leader José Ramos-Horta recalls his [...] "vehement protests" [...] against his party's refusal to attend the meeting. [...] "This", he writes, [...] "was one of our {{tactical}} political errors for <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never find an intelligent explanation." ...|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress revealed, [...] "Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... put something on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E

500|$|Hunt {{began working}} on tracks for a {{follow-up}} project in 2008. Two songs from those sessions, [...] "Moving Targets" [...] and [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", were included on What Were You Hoping For?. After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for What Were You Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the ban, {{the four}} {{students}} offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with [...] "a disproportionate number of interesting girls." [...] He later stated that [...] "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> so unambiguously demonstrate success." [...] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. [...] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E

2500|$|... "Among {{some talk}} {{of you and}} me" [...] may be a {{reference}} to [...] of Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ("There was a Door to which I found no Key / There was a Veil past <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see / Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee / There seemed — and then no more of Thee and Me.") ...|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{species has}} by its conical shape some {{resemblance}} with Carenzia trispinosa (Watson, 1879), but that species is considerably smaller, with less distinct spines, which have more {{the character of}} rounded tubercles. It has smooth interstices, without the conspicuous plications of the new species. The circumstance that {{the base of the}} specimens of trispinosa <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> compare is much smoother, seems to give no reliable distinguishing character, at least Watson ("Challenger"-Gastropoda, p. iio) says: [...] "has some faint spirals".|$|E

2500|$|As Blyth had {{suggested}} earlier, Darwin wrote on 9 December to Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa, {{and said that}} he was [...] "collecting all the facts & reasoning <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> in regard to the variation & origin of species", particularly pigeons. On 24 December Darwin wrote to the diplomat Sir Charles Augustus Murray in Persia, similarly saying he had [...] "for many years been working on the perplexed subject of the origin of varieties & species, & for this purpose I am endeavouring to study the effects of domestication".|$|E
2500|$|In 1832, Miller {{submitted}} {{a series of}} sixteen articles to the Vermont Telegraph—a Baptist paper. The first of these was published on May 15, and Miller writes of the public’s response, [...] "I began to be flooded with letters of inquiry respecting my views, and visitors flocked to converse {{with me on the}} subject." [...] In 1834, unable to personally comply with many of the urgent requests for information and the invitations to travel and preach that he received, Miller published a synopsis of his teachings in a [...] "little tract of 64 pages." [...] These he [...] "...scattered, the most of them gratuitously, sending them in reply to letters of inquiry and to places <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not visit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reporting to Sherman on November 22, Hazen said, [...] "{T]o {{have made}} peace with them would have brought to my camp most of those now on the war path south of the Arkansas; and as General Sheridan is to punish those at war and might follow them in afterwards, a second Chivington affair might occur, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not prevent." [...] Hazen {{reported}} that while the chiefs seemed sincere, the Kiowa and Comanche at Fort Cobb said the young warriors who accompanied the chiefs were pleased that peace had not been made. They boasted that the Lakota and other northern bands would come down the following spring to [...] "clean out the entire country." [...] Hazen took the young warriors' boasts so seriously that he requested two more companies of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Arbuckle and two howitzers to remain {{for a week or}} two at Fort Cobb.|$|E
