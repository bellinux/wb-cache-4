5|$|Week seven saw housemates {{take part}} in a Greek-themed {{shopping}} task <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist,</b> which involved Charlie and Rodrigo learning a routine by Stavros Flatley, a dance duo featured on Britain's Got Talent. However, playing Zeus, Halfwit was the only housemate aware of {{the true nature of the}} task. In each of three challenges he had to ensure, while still keeping the secret, that his chosen champion defeated the appropriate Greek god. He failed and the housemates received a basic shopping budget. Bea, Charlie, David, Dogface, Halfwit, Hira, Kenneth, Marcus, Noirin, Siavash and Tom all faced eviction. In the early hours of Day 50, Kenneth escaped from the House via the rooftop with help from Marcus, and this led to the eviction being cancelled.|$|E

5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist,</b> and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III in a Full Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Twist</b> of Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy made an appearance on January 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling on its live Pop TV debut backstage and ringside to support his brother Matt in the semi-finals and finals of the TNA World Title Series, which Matt had later lost.|$|E

25|$|In wire transposition, {{the wires}} {{exchange}} position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar EMI from power lines.

25|$|Metro-land (notably west Hertfordshire) {{formed the}} {{backdrop}} for the 1960s ABC TV series The Avengers, whose popular imagery was deployed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> of fantasy. The archetypal Metro-land subjects (such as the railway station and the quiet suburb) became the settings for fiendish plots and treachery in this series and others, such as The Saint, The Baron and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), all of which made regular use of locations within easy reach of film studios at Borehamwood and Pinewood.|$|E
25|$|After the Bucs {{defeated}} Carolina, 12–9, in an ‘ugly’ game {{three weeks}} ago in Charlotte, the rematch was billed as another defensive struggle, though <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist.</b> While this was indeed a matchup of the league's first and third-ranked defenses, it also marked the returns of starting quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Rodney Peete, each of whom missed the last game between the two. Statistically, Johnson and the Bucs’ defense came out on top, though Bucs Head Coach Jon Gruden complimented the Panthers’ work, as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E

500|$|Erick Harper of DVD Verdict {{remarked that}} the film was [...] "of {{questionable}} value" [...] and opined it was a [...] "truly awful example of drive-in cinema".

Leonard Maltin gave the film {{one and a half}} stars, calling it [...] "dreary", but he believed that it became [...] "reasonably eerie toward the end, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> that's actually a surprise". Authors Phil Hardy and Tom Milne wrote of the film, [...] "Nicol, an actor here directing for the first time, lets the action spin out much too slackly, dissipating the grasp of moody tension he displayed in his unpretentiously excellent war movie, Three Came Back.|$|E

500|$|Continuing the band's {{prominent}} use of strings– {{which began}} with the 1982 single [...] "The Back of Love"– they recorded Ocean Rain using a 35-piece orchestra. Lead guitarist Will Sergeant said, [...] "We wanted to make something conceptual with lush orchestration; not Mantovani, something <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist.</b> It's all pretty dark. 'Thorn of Crowns' {{is based on an}} eastern scale. The whole mood is very windswept: European pirates, a bit Ben Gunn; dark and stormy, battering rain; all of that." [...] During recording De Freitas used xylophones and glockenspiels in addition to his usual percussion, bass player Les Pattinson used an old reverb machine at des Dames and Sergeant's solo on [...] "My Kingdom" [...] was played using a Washburn acoustic guitar which he distorted through a valve radio.|$|E
500|$|Hogarth {{took his}} {{inspiration}} for the series from the classical satires of Horace and Juvenal, via their Augustan counterparts, particularly John Gay's [...] "Trivia" [...] and Jonathan Swift's [...] "A Description of a City Shower" [...] and [...] "A Description of the Morning". He took his artistic models from other series of the [...] "Times of Day", [...] "The Seasons" [...] and [...] "Ages of Man", such as those by Nicolas Poussin and Nicholas Lancret, and from pastoral scenes, but executed them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> by transferring them to the city. He also drew on the Flemish [...] "Times of Day" [...] style known as points du jour, in which the gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses, but in Hogarth's works the gods were recast as his central characters: the churchgoing lady, a frosty Aurora in Morning; the pie-girl, a pretty London Venus in Noon; the pregnant woman, a sweaty Diana in Evening; and the freemason, a drunken Pluto in Night.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé premiered the video, {{alongside}} the video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008.

Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News described the video as a [...] "meaningful one—and it comes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>twist</b> that requires repeat viewing". She noted {{that if the}} video did not exist, {{she would not have}} seen the tomboy side of Beyoncé. A writer for Rap-Up commented, [...] "Beyoncé delivers one of the year's best videos with the black and white clip." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! Online praised the video, writing that it has a [...] "serious melodramatic storyline". She further noted that it was [...] "slow and everyone overacts, but be sure to catch the end where a major twist will probably change your outlook on the dynamics of male–female relationships forever".|$|E
