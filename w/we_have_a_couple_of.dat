[...] {7} and drawing his scimitar, he waved it over his head, and shouted out his cry of battle. It was repeated {{by many of the}} other omrahs; the sound of their cheers was carried into the camp, and caught up by the men; the camels began to cry, the horses to prance and neigh, the eight hundred elephants set up a scream, the trumpeters and drummers clanged away at their instruments. I never heard such a din before or after. How I trembled for my little garrison when I heard the enthusiastic cries of this innumerable host! ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{is another}} very pretty thing--the boys' sucker, only refined by the philosopher. We young ones {{have a perfect}} right to take toys, and make them into {{philosophy}}, inasmuch as now-a-days we are turning philosophy into toys. Here is a sucker, only it is made of india-rubber: if I clap it upon the table, you see at once it holds. Why does it hold? I can slip it about, and yet if I try to pull it up, {{it seems as if}} it would pull the table with it I can easily make it slip about from place to place; but only when I bring it {{to the edge of the}} table can I get it off. It is only kept down by the pressure of the atmosphere above. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> them; and if you take these two and press them together, you will see how firmly they stick. And, indeed, we may use them as they are proposed to be used, to stick against windows, or against walls, where they will adhere for an evening, and serve to hang anything on that you want. I think, however, that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at home; and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the pressure of the atmosphere. Here is a tumbler of water. Suppose I were to ask you to turn that tumbler upside-down, so that the water should not fall out, and yet not be kept in by your hand, but merely by using the pressure of the atmosphere. Could you do that? Take a wine-glass, either quite full or half-full of water, and put a flat card on the top, turn it upside-down, and then see what becomes of the card and of the water. The air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the edge keeps it out.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Cruz claimed that fans could expect more uptempo dance tracks on his then-forthcoming album. He explained: [...] "The new album will be out before Christmas. We'll <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of singles before then, too. It's {{definitely going to be}} more of the uptempo, fun, energetic vibe that you've heard on 'Break Your Heart', 'Higher' and 'Dynamite'.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with lead composer Ludvig Forssell, {{it was revealed that}} there were over eight different versions of Sins of the Father made just for the trailer, on top of the various previous renditions. Forssell himself provided the vocals during development. The song supposedly is a metaphor not only for The Phantom Pain, but the entire Metal Gear Saga: [...] "For this game <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> keywords: race and revenge, and… unfortunately I cannot at this point tell you everything, but there’s a lot of metaphors in the lyrics {{that have to do with}} the game, and the whole Metal Gear Saga, pretty much."

The writers told her, [...] "Yeah, you know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> directions we want to go in but we’re not really sure." [...] The series planned to wait for the fan response before they chose a direction for the character. Morgan, who grew up watching the soap with her mother was relieved that she got to build her character from scratch. [...] "This is a brand new character which is good for me because I didn't {{have to figure out how}} to play her any differently than someone else had" [...] Morgan stated. She continued that [...] "I modeled her after me when I was in university." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking in July 2008 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Legend {{explained}} {{what he wanted}} to achieve musically with 'Evolver': [...] "I wanted it to be diverse. So I basically just wanted to make some great records that together covered the whole gamut of the various forms of expression I feel comfortable doing. So <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> club tracks; we have a reggae song; we have a few really strong ballads... and kind of everything in between. Plus we have a political anthem at the end as well. So, while there are some elements that people have heard in previous albums of mine, I also think there are some things people HAVEN'T heard from me before. And I think that's what makes the album interesting. In particular I feel I've made different arrangement and production choices this time. While I don't think my writing style itself has changed significantly, sonically the main difference is that we chose to use more electronic instruments on this record." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore the Coupled Cluster method in Quantum Chemistry. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{implemented}} <b>an</b> effective <b>Coupled</b> Cluster Singles and Doubles code.

5000|$|The series used 50 horses, {{trained by}} Matt Chew at Santa Anita. As he described, [...] "Because it’s a natural {{tendency}} for horses {{to want to}} be a part of a herd, most adapt to it very well. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> individuals that <b>have</b> been taught to be race horses; we’re not going to get that out of their system. We'll just have to adapt to it. But of the 50 horses, I’d say 45 of them have adapted to it real well." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think it}} was a really good {{performance}} today. It was a step up in a lot of aspects. Technically it wasn't what we were aiming for. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of little mistakes here and there which certainly you can't get away at this point. We're looking to execute everything perfectly at this point of the season, but I think we've made some improvement in a lot of other areas. Despite the little mistakes we are headed into the right direction and we're feeling good", Davis said.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2003, Cregan {{was interviewed}} for the fan site The Harley Fanzone, where {{he spoke of}} his role as {{producer}} on the song: [...] "We did [...] "A Friend For Life" [...] together which was a real change for me because suddenly instead of Steve being the producer, I was. I thought, [...] "this could be strange" [...] because {{he had always been}} the man in charge. Was he going {{to let go of the}} reins? How hard was that going to be? But it was fine - he obviously put his two cents in. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> other songs which haven't been fully recorded yet." [...] Later in 2013, Harley played at the Rewind Festival and was interviewed after his performance. When asked what song of his he felt was a [...] "hidden gem" [...] and that people should listen to, Harley replied: [...] "Oh, that's a good question! A hidden gem? There's a song called [...] "A Friend for Life", which I sang today. It touches people of a certain age. A lot of my audience are grandparents, 50s and 60s. It touches them." ...|$|E

In an interview he describe the inspiration of film: [...] "When we heard stories shared by {{friends and family members}} who had risked everything to do the 'dunky,' we were fascinated by these stories; however, one question still rankled in us. It was, “Why do men risk their lives to do the 'dunky'?" [...] Our research had dispelled the notion that it is a pure economic question. The truth is there is no one answer. Men do want to change their lives overnight, especially young men who find all legitimate doors closed for them. At the same time, it is almost a tradition which has been followed through generations. further adding he said, [...] "Meenu and I have been collaborating on many projects. We have done documentaries, music videos and scripts together. Right now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> documentaries we want to finish. One is called The Ghost of Maula Jutt, which is about the rise and decay of Lollywood."Zinda Bhaag became one of the highest-grossing of Pakistan and has won many accolades and recognition including an official selection for Best Foreign Language Film at 86th Academy Awards however was out of the competition for the final race. Zinda Bhaag was only the third Pakistani film in 50 years to get recognition at the Oscars, after 1959's The Day Shall Dawn and 1963's The Veil.|$|E

40|$|The {{journey to}} have {{a common set of}} {{accounting}} standards started long before to give it a professional shape and essence. And accountants all over the world feel the necessity to shorten the gap among different streams of accounting practices through harmonization. Still, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> strong variants of accounting practices (say, for example, US GAAP, UK GAAP, IAS etc.) over the world existed and practiced simultaneously. These variants are working as threats towards harmonization of accounting practices. However, the profession has also witnessed some improvements in recent years in the process of global convergence putting some ray of hope. International and even local standard setting bodies have come up with projects of harmonization and in most of the cases became successful.     The day is not far away when we will observe that accounting world is controlled and guided by a single set of standards giving it a status of legal discipline in true sense. The paper focuses on this harmonization issue, its current status, challenges with special reference to Indian perspective. </p...|$|E
