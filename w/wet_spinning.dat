With the rise of wearable consumer and medical devices, a suitable flexible and wearable means of storing electrical energy is required. Fibre-based devices present a possible method of achieving this aim. Fibres are inherently more flexible than their bulk counterparts, and as such can be employed to form the electrodes of flexible batteries and capacitors. They also present a facile possibility for incorporation into many fabrics and clothes, further boosting their potential for use in wearable devices. Electrically conducting fibres were produced from a dispersion of carbon nanomaterials in a room temperature ionic liquid. Coagulation of this dispersion was achieved through manual injection into aqueous solutions of xanthan gum. The limitations of this method are highlighted by very low ultimate tensile strengths of these fibres, {{in the order of}} 3 MPa, with high variation within all of the fibres. Fibres were also produced via scrolling of bi-component films containing poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).

5000|$|Common to each {{of these}} methods is the use of a spinneret, a device {{containing}} a needle through which solvent is extruded and an annulus through which a polymer solution is extruded. As the polymer is extruded through the annulus of the spinneret, it retains a hollow cylindrical shape.

Both in ultrafiltration and in hyperfiltration (reverse osmosis) asymmetric membranes are in use. Two different types of methods can be distinguished for the characterization of porous properties of membranes, aiming resp. at morphological structure and permeability of membranes. The methods at hand to characterize the morphological structure of membranes are akin to those used for <b>wet</b> <b>spun</b> polymer fibers. Thus, scanning electron microscopy, thanks to its large depth of focus has given insight as {{to the type of}} pores existing in support layers (closed or open cells). It is much more difficult to get relevant information on morphological structures existing in the skin. Transmission electron microscopy, which is able to show domain structures (≈ 500 P.) in thin films of block-copolymers, should give some of the answers here. Further ways to characterize porous membrane structures are to be explored in mercury porosimetry (pressing mercury in dried and evacuated membrane materials) and through gas adsorption measurements (BET-method). In both cases membrane treatment must be such that the pores are kept in their original size and shape (liquid exchange to non-swelling liquids before drying). The second and more direct way in defining membrane performance concerns selective permeability and is characterized by the so-called cut-off of membranes. A basic assumption made very often here is that permeability decreases with molecular size, because of a given pore size distribution in the skin. It should be realized that except for the pore sizes in the membrane {{and the size of the}} permeating substance, also the chemical nature (charge, extent of hydration) of the substances to be separated and that of the membrane material are important. Some relevant criteria for the choice of testing compounds in cut-off studies will be given, and typical results for all the foregoing topics will be presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} dissolution of keratin from chicken feathers and subsequent development of normal and ultrafine fibers for textile and biomedical applications. In {{the last few}} decades, efforts {{have been made to}} transform the largely-available waste material, chicken feathers into fibers but they have yielded no success. In addition, keratin is preferred in biomedical applications due to the existence of cell-binding motifs in its molecular structures. However, 100 % keratin ultrafine fibers have not been developed also due to lack of proper dissolution methods. Regarding the structures of scaffolds, three-dimensional (3 D) fibrous structures possess advantages over two-dimensional (2 D) structures as tissue engineering scaffolds since they show higher structural similarity to the natural extracellular matrices. ^ In this research, dissolution conditions are studied in order to obtain keratin solution with good spinnability. First, keratin is extracted from chicken feathers with backbones preserved after cleavage of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds using cysteine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is applied to dissolve keratin for spinning and mechanism of dissolution of keratin with SDS is investigated. Normal keratin fibers are <b>wet</b> <b>spun</b> and 3 D ultrafine keratin fibrous scaffolds are produced via electrospinning. Increasing SDS concentration intensifies ordered conformation of keratin and firstly increases and then decreases viscosity of solution, suggesting continuous disentanglement of keratin molecules and enhancement in inter- and intramolecular electrical repulsion. The diameters of obtained fibers as small as 20 microns also prove good drawability of keratin solution. The change of crystallinity is found to be consistent with that of tensile properties. In addition, structures composed of three-dimensionally oriented ultrafine pure keratin fibers are electrospun. The 3 D scaffolds are water-stable. The adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells penetrate more deeply and distribute more evenly in the 3 D keratin fibrous structures comparing to commercial 3 D scaffolds and electrospun 2 D polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds. The dissolution and 3 D electrospinning methods are applied to wheat glutenin, another highly-crosslinked plant protein for adipose tissue engineering. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of high modulus/high strength fibers of poly-(p-phenylene benzobisthiazole) (PBT) {{have been investigated}} in relation to fiber microstructure and fibrillar morphology. Heat treatment processing of dry-jet <b>wet</b> <b>spun</b> PBT fibers was undertaken to provide fiber samples for a systematic comparison of structure-property relationships. Heat treated PBT fibers possessing a tensile modulus as high as 300 GPa with tensile strength of 3 GPa have been produced by employing heat treatment conditions bordering on polymer degradation; temperatures of 630 (DEGREES) C - 680 (DEGREES) C {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} with applied tensions approaching fiber breakage. ^ Quantitative measures of mechanical anisotropy were obtained for PBT fibers in torsional and bending experiments. Torsional shear modulus values of 1 - 1. 5 GPa were measured in free torsional oscillation experiments and shear strengths of 60 - 140 MPa were obtained from twisting experiments. Bending studies provided a measure of compressive strength, with fibers exhibiting buckling for compressive stresses of approximately 700 MPa. The state of stress in model cylindically orthotropic fiber structures was analyzed using anisotropic elasticity theory. Tension. compression, torsion and bending were examined in order to compare the predicted level of transverse stress with the measured (relatively low) lateral strength. ^ Optical microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to examine the structure of PBT fibers. Crystallite size perpendicular to the fiber axis increases from approximately 2 nm in as-spun fibers to 10 - 12 nm in fibers heat treated at temperatures above 600 (DEGREES) C. Fiber tensile strength was found to increase with increase in the extent of the lateral molecular order. However, tensile modulus and tensile strength did not depend directly on heat treatment parameters of temperature, time but rather indirectly through the affect of applied tension during heat treatment on the overall axial orientation. The highest values of fiber tensile modulus and tensile strength were exhibited by the more highly oriented fibers. ...|$|R
