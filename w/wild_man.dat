5|$|The next morning, Mulder calls Scully to come bail him out. Afterwards, Scully brings Mulder to {{meet with}} Dr. Diamond, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Maryland, before going on a date with Rob. The local park ranger contacts Mulder after finding the corpse of a <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> in the woods who he believes could be the Jersey Devil. Scully and Mulder bring the ranger and Dr. Diamond to the morgue, where the body has mysteriously vanished. Mulder believes that the Jersey Devil they are hunting is actually the creature's mate who has headed into Atlantic City in search of food after her mate's death. The agents, along with the ranger and Dr. Diamond, search for the creature in an abandoned building. While they are searching the building, Detective Thompson arrives with a SWAT team.|$|E

5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The <b>Wild</b> <b>Man</b> solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E
5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight {{can also be seen}} as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} play into the concept of the Green Man/ <b>Wild</b> <b>Man</b> dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E

25|$|The medieval wild-man concept {{also drew}} on lore about similar beings from the Classical world {{such as the}} Roman faun and Silvanus, and perhaps even Heracles. Several folk traditions about the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> {{correspond}} with ancient practices and beliefs. Notably, peasants in the Grisons tried to capture the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> by getting him drunk and tying him up in hopes that he would give them his wisdom in exchange for freedom. This suggests a association with an ancient tradition - recorded as early as Xenophon (died 354 BC) and appearing {{in the works of}} Ovid, Pausanias, and Claudius Aelianus - in which shepherds caught a forest being, here termed Silenus or Faunus, in the same manner and for the same purpose.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the popular folklore of the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> has origin from a cultural memory of agricultural peoples living alongside hunter-gatherers during the Neolithic period or later, which fossil evidence suggests was as long as 2,000 years in Northern Europe. Tacitus (57-117 AD) even describes the Fenni of eastern Europe as primitive foragers {{at the end of his}} Germania, indicating the lifestyle was still active in the remotest parts of Europe during the 1st century AD. The folklore of the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> is found widely across time and geography in Northern and Eastern Europe, and may predate the first written records considerably, as many traditional figures do. For example, figures of pre-Christian Irish mythology continued in diminutive forms alongside Christian culture, and Greek deities continued to be used as icons in 19th century Britain; in such ways the woodwose could be the mythological incarnation of past interactions with the last foraging societies of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Various {{languages}} and traditions include names suggesting affinities with Orcus, a Roman and Italic god of death. For many years people in Tyrol called the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> Orke, Lorke, or Noerglein, while {{in parts of}} Italy he was the orco or huorco. The French ogre has the same derivation, as do modern literary orcs. Importantly, Orcus is associated with Maia in a dance celebrated late enough to be condemned in a 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential.|$|E
25|$|Superficially the Green Man {{would appear}} to be pagan, perhaps a {{fertility}} figure or a nature spirit, similar to the woodwose (the <b>wild</b> <b>man</b> of the woods), and yet he frequently appears, carved in wood or stone, in churches, chapels, abbeys and cathedrals, where examples can be found dating through to the 20th century. The earliest example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.|$|E
