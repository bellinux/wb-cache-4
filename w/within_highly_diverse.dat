40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, there has been phenomenal growth in the area of bio-diversity studies, largely {{motivated}} by the economic and humanitarian potential that underlines the understanding of biodiversity dynamics. New area has been arisen which is called Bio-prospecting, which focus is solely on shifting through biodiversity data to locate potentially profitable biological sources. The major difficulty faced by biodiversity scientist, is the effective management and the access of large amounts and varied types of data arise in their studies, ranging from micro-level biological information (genetic makeup of organism and plants) to macro-level information (including ecological and habitat characteristics of species). Biological diversity {{plays an important role in}} human lives. The interaction of species <b>within</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> ecosystems performs ecological functions that are extremely important to many human activities.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants with {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} represent a state-of-the-art technology. Nevertheless, {{the process of}} phosphate removal is prone to occasional failure. One reason is the lack of knowledge about the structure and function of the bacterial communities involved. Most of the bacteria are still not cultivable, and their functions during the wastewater treatment process are therefore unknown or subject of speculation. Here, flow cytometry was used to identify bacteria capable of polyphosphate accumulation <b>within</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> communities. A novel fluorescent staining technique for the quantitative detection of polyphosphate granules on the cellular level was developed. It uses the bright green fluorescence of the antibiotic tetracycline when it complexes the divalent cations acting as a countercharge in polyphosphate granules. The dynamics of cellular DNA contents and cell sizes as growth indicators were determined in parallel to detect the most active polyphosphate-accumulating individuals/subcommunities and to determine their phylogenetic affiliation upon cell sorting. Phylotypes known as polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, such as a “Candidatus Accumulibacter”-like phylotype, were found, as well as members of the genera Pseudomonas and Tetrasphaera. The new method allows fast and convenient monitoring of the growth and polyphosphate accumulation dynamics of not-yet-cultivated bacteria in wastewater bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|<b>Within</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> ecosystems, the {{majority}} of bacterial taxa are present in low abundance {{as members of the}} rare biosphere. The rationale for the occurrence and maintenance of the rare biosphere, and the putative ecological role(s) and dynamics of its members within a specific ecosystem is currently debated. We hypothesized that in highly diverse ecosystems, a fraction of the rare biosphere acts as a backup system that readily responds to environmental disturbances. We tested this hypothesis by subjecting sediments from Zodletone spring, a sulfide- and sulfur-rich spring in Southwestern OK, to incremental levels of salinity (1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 % NaCl), or temperature (28 °, 30 °, 32 °, and 70 °C), and traced the trajectories of rare members of the community in response to these manipulations using 16 S rRNA gene analysis. Our results indicate that multiple rare bacterial taxa are promoted from rare to abundant members of the community following such manipulations and that, in general, the magnitude of such recruitment is directly proportional to the severity of the applied manipulation. Rare members that are phylogenetically distinct from abundant taxa in the original sample (unique rare biosphere) played a more important role in the microbial community response to environmental disturbances, compared to rare members that are phylogenetically similar to abundant taxa in the original sample (non-unique rare biosphere). The results emphasize the dynamic nature of the rare biosphere, and highlight its complexity and non-monolithic nature...|$|E

PP 1 catalytic subunits form complexes with {{a variety}} of interacting proteins that control its ability to dephosphorylate substrates. Here we show that the human mitotic kinesin- 8, KIF 18 A, directly interacts with PP 1 γ through a conserved RVxF motif. Our phylogenetic analyses of the kinesins further uncovered the broad conservation of this interaction potential <b>within</b> the otherwise <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> motor-protein superfamily.

40|$|Introduction: Studies {{examining}} {{the use of}} pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) have not been adequately summarized. Recently, the Bangkok Tenofovir Study has shown that PrEP may be effective at reducing new HIV infections among this high-risk group. This randomized controlled trial was the first study to specifically examine the efficacy of PrEP among PWIDs. In this review, we present {{the current state of}} evidence regarding the use of PrEP to prevent HIV infection in PWID populations, and set an agenda for future research to inform the most effective implementation of PrEP in the context of existing evidence-based HIV prevention strategies. Discussion: Despite positive trial results confirming that PrEP may prevent HIV transmission among PWIDs, there remain many questions regarding the interpretation of these results, as well as obstacles to the implementation of PrEP regimens <b>within</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> drug-using communities. Aside from the Bangkok Tenofovir Study, we identified only one other published study that has collected empirical data to inform the use of PrEP among PWIDs. The large gap in research regarding the use and implementation of PrEP for PWIDs signals the need for further research and attention. Conclusions: We recommend that future research efforts focus on elucidating the generalizability of the Bangkok Tenofovir Study results in other injection drug–using populations, {{examining the}} willingness of PWIDs to use PrEP in diverse contexts, identifying barriers to adherence to PrEP regimens and determining the most effective ways to implement PrEP programmes within the context of existing evidence-based prevention strategies, including opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe distribution programmes...|$|E
40|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that plants in biodiversity hotspots suffer more from pollen limitation of reproduction than those in lower diversity regions, primarily due to the response of self-incompatible species. Species in biodiversity hotspots may thus be more at risk of limited reproduction and subsequent population decline. Should these species have restricted ranges (i. e. be endemics to a certain region), pollen limitation <b>within</b> <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> regions may pose an important threat to global plant biodiversity. We further dissect the global pattern by exploring whether pollen limitation of range-restricted (endemic) species is distinctive and/or relates differently to species diversity than that of widespread (non-endemic) species. To provide a preliminary test of this prediction we conducted both cross-species and comparative phylogenetic meta-analyses {{to determine the effect}} of endemism on the magnitude of pollen limitation and its relationship with regional species richness. Our data set included 287 plant species belonging to 78 families distributed world-wide. Our results revealed that endemism and self-compatibility contribute to the global association between pollen limitation and species richness. Self-incompatible species were more pollen limited than self-compatible ones, and the PICs analysis indicated that transitions to endemism were associated with transitions to self-compatibility. The relationship between pollen limitation and species richness was significant only for the self-incompatible species, and was monotonically increasing in non-endemic species but accelerating in the endemic species. Thus, self-incompatible endemic species from biodiversity hotspots are at the greatest risk of pollination failure, a previously unknown aspect suggesting this group of species as a top priority for future development of conservation strategies. In contrast, reproduction of self-compatible species appears to be unrelated to plant diversity, although we caution that current data do not account for the reproductive limitation due to the quality of pollen received. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these patterns requires further investigation into plant-plant pollinator mediated interactions and the dynamics of pollen transfer in communities differing in species diversity. © 2009 The Authors.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} migrant transnationalism have {{emphasised}} migrants’ points {{of origin and}} area of destination <b>within</b> their <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> and mobile circumstances, but focus primarily on permanent migrants. The {{rise in the number}} of temporary migrants makes it important to re-examine how this concept can be applied to temporary migrants and their mobility and sense of belongingness. In this paper, the transnationalism of one group of temporary migrants, seafarers, is examined. The complexity of the seafarers’ encounters raises a question as to the extent to which transnationalism can be used to explore their modes of integration ashore and aboard. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation aboard and ashore, this paper focuses on the transnational relations and practices of Filipino seafarers towards the ship and their community. Accordingly, the analytical task centres on how seafarers integrate; their degree of embeddedness. On the ship, empirical issues regarding hierarchy, intercultural relationships and occupational seafaring culture contribute to an enhanced understanding of their form of inclusion. On land, social and economic status and community affiliations provide insights on their capacity and motives for remaining integrated ashore. This study shows that the myriad ways that these seafarers sustain relationships allow them to achieve a sense of belongingness, but that this was uneven owing to the nature of the ship as a place of work and temporary home...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore and {{describe}} (Gray, 2009) how an analysis of risk and resilience in the first sand tray of youth in a rural school may inform knowledge on psychological assessment in South Africa as well as assessment for resilience in high adversity settings. The study forms part of a continuing investigation of the Centre for the Study of Resilience with regards to the nature of school-based Educational Psychology services in remote South Africa. An instrumental case study design was used to identify risk and resilience in the first sand trays of 25 youth at a rural school in Mpumalanga. The youth were between the ages of 13 and 19. Data was gathered in the form of visual data (photographs), client narratives and Academic Service Learning student reflections. The results indicated that the first sand trays of youth at a rural school in South Africa can be effectively used in assessing resilience. Indicators of both risk and protective resources emerged during data analysis. Within the first sand tray violence and a need for protection, unfulfilled basic- and nurturance needs, and gender inequality and conflict emerged as indicators of risk. Spirituality, fulfilled needs, and a sense of belonging emerged as protective resources. These findings indicate that <b>within</b> a <b>highly</b> <b>diverse,</b> and, adverse setting, sand trays can be used to assess resilience. Dissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} the TCR repertoire of mouse Vγ 4 (+) γδ T cells in correlation with their developmental origin and homeostasis. By deep sequencing we identify a high frequency of straight Vδ 5 Dδ 2 Jδ 1 germline rearrangements without P- and N-nucleotides <b>within</b> the otherwise <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> Trd repertoire of Vγ 4 (+) cells. This sequence is infrequent in CCR 6 (-) CD 27 (+) cells, but abundant among CCR 6 (+) CD 27 (-) γδ T cells. Using an inducible Rag 1 knock-in mouse model, {{we show that}} γδ T cells generated in the adult thymus rarely contain this germline-rearranged Vδ 5 Dδ 2 Jδ 1 sequence, confirming its fetal origin. Single-cell analysis and deep sequencing of the Trg locus reveal a dominant CDR 3 junctional motif that completes the TCR repertoire of invariant Vγ 4 (+) Vδ 5 (+) cells. In conclusion, this study identifies an innate subset of fetal thymus-derived γδ T cells with an invariant Vγ 4 (+) Vδ 5 (+) TCR that is restricted to the CCR 6 (+) CD 27 (-) subset of γδ T cells...|$|R
40|$|Broad-scale {{patterns}} of subterranean diversity are a fascinating but neglected part of biodiversity research. Carabid beetles adapted to belowground habitats form a particularly species-rich {{part of the}} subterranean fauna. We studied large-scale diversity {{patterns of}} these belowground carabids across the western Palaearctic and evaluated potential impacts of historical and contemporary environmental conditions {{on the distribution of}} these taxa, using available species richness and environmental data at country level. Regression modelling and variation partitioning showed a strong relationship between species richness and range in elevation. Potential effects of climatic variables, mainly those related to ambient energy input, were much weaker. We discuss the implications of this combination of effects, which suggests, concordant with the absence of subterranean carabids in northern and highest richness in southern Europe, a strong prevailing influence of historical processes on current richness distributions of these taxa. Previous studies did not provide clear indications for such an influence. In contrast to more mobile and widespread carabid beetles, dispersal limitation due to high adaptation of belowground carabids to subterranean habitats has probably hindered their re-colonization of former permafrost and glaciated regions. Hotspots of highest belowground diversity are located in regions with an assumed long-term stability of environmental conditions, correlating with patterns of other dispersal-limited taxa such as many endemic plants. Our study provides important new information in the discussion of potential determinants of the distinct geographic patterns of belowground diversity. Moreover, it contributes {{to a better understanding of}} range size related differences previously found in the distribution of diversity and environmental dependencies of widespread and range-restricted species <b>within</b> the <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> carabid beetles...|$|R
40|$|Time is an {{important}} dimension of brain function, but little is yet known about the underlying cognitive principles and neurobiological mechanisms. The field of timing and time perception has witnessed tremendous growth and multidisciplinary interest {{in the recent years}} with the advent of modern neuroimaging and neurophysiological approaches. In this article, I used a data mining approach to analyze the timing literature published by a select group of researchers (n = 202) during the period 2000 - 2015 and highlight important reviews as well as empirical articles that meet the criterion of a minimum of 100 citations. The qualifying articles (n = 150) are listed in a table along with key details such as number of citations, names of authors, year and journal of publication as well as a short summary of the findings of each study. The results of such a data-driven approach to literature review not only serve as a useful resource to any researcher interested in timing, but also provides a means to evaluate key papers that have significantly influenced the field and summarize recent progress and popular research trends in the field. Additionally, such analyses provides food for thought about future scientific directions and raises important questions about improving organizational structures to boost open science and progress in the field. I discuss exciting avenues for future research that have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the neurobiology of timing, and propose the establishment of a new society to promote open science and collaborative work <b>within</b> the <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> and multidisciplinary community of researchers in the field of timing and time perception...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{differentiation}} {{is one of}} {{the marks}} of multicellular organisms. Terminally specialised nitrogen-fixing cells, termed heterocysts, evolved in filamentous cyanobacteria more than 2 Gya. The development of their spacing pattern has been thoroughly investigated in model organisms such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. This paper focuses on the more complex, branching cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus (Stigonematales). Contrary to what has been previously published, a heterocyst spacing pattern is present in M. laminosus but it varies with the age of the culture and the morphology of the cells. Heterocysts in young, narrow trichomes were more widely spaced (∼ 14. 8 cells) than those in old, wide trichomes (∼ 9. 4 cells). Biochemical and transgenic experiments reveal that the heterocyst spacing pattern is affected by the heterocyst inhibitor PatS. Addition of the pentapeptide RGSGR (PatS- 5) to the growth medium and overexpression of patS from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 in M. laminosus resulted in the loss of heterocyst differentiation under nitrogen deprivation. Bioinformatics investigations indicated that putative PatS sequences <b>within</b> cyanobacteria are <b>highly</b> <b>diverse,</b> and fall into two main clades. Both are present in most branching cyanobacteria.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} identity formation within the London investment banking sector {{in the context of}} career development. The sector has undergone a host of changes in the past two decades. The ‘Old City’ was distinguished by trust, reputation and stability which was informally regulated through a kinship network comprised of a social elite. De-regulation in 1986 ushered in the ‘New City’ characterised by individualistic competition, inflated capital sums, truncated careers, volatility and diversification. Existing research concerning identity has largely focussed on how ‘Old City’ class and gender relations continue to predominate and shape career opportunities. Scholars have highlighted how patterns of privilege and exclusion are reproduced through a variety of ‘performances,’ disadvantaging those who are unable to access a limited range of acceptable class and gender positions. This study takes a different starting point to explore how ‘performance’ {{may play a role in}} identity work to further careers but in a way which is attentive to the distinctive conditions of the New City. Specifically, this research explores how identity may be constructed and constantly re-worked and revised, drawing upon a range of different resources <b>within</b> a <b>highly</b> <b>diverse</b> setting. The thesis seeks to engage with this research agenda by applying Giddens (1984; 1991) theoretical framework on self-identity, reflexivity and performance. A longitudinal research design was used to elicit qualitative data from six senior investment bank employees, gathering accounts on changes experienced over the period of a year as well as past events. The thesis investigates how a biographical narrative was reflexively maintained via the accommodation and perpetuation of a variety of different performances within a series of social terrains. These in turn served to reproduce the broader financial institutional context. A further contribution is developed which focuses on the theoretical interplays between selfidentity, reflexivity and performance through a detailed analysis of the empirical materials.
