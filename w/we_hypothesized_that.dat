30|$|<b>We</b> <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> the {{challenges}} BD patients {{experience and the}} associated care and research needs are interwoven, and that combining them would provide a more comprehensive understanding. <b>We</b> <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> this more comprehensive understanding would help {{to close the gap}} between clinical practice and research.

30|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} shrub and herbaceous cover and density, and ground cover (litter, bio-crust, bare ground) responses to seasonal burning of western juniper in three distinct plant communities in eastern Oregon. <b>We</b> <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> herbaceous and shrub vegetation and ground cover variables {{would not change}} in response to seasonal burning of juniper, or to cutting and leaving trees on site compared to untreated controls. <b>We</b> <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> herbaceous and shrub vegetation and ground cover variables would not be different among seasonal burning or cutting treatments of juniper.

30|$|Based on the inter-individual {{variation}} in BP response after RDN, <b>we</b> <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} wide variability in kidney sympathetic denervation following RDN. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> changes in renal sympathetic activity would relate to changes in BP and neurohormonal activity following RDN.

Furthermore, by conducting a number needed to treat to harm and concomitant cost analysis comparing the combined reoperation and secondary femoral shaft refracture rates of the short and long CMN derived from our systematic review, <b>we</b> <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> short CMN are significantly more cost effective.|$|R
