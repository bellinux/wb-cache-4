2500|$|One {{major and}} understudied area of family traditions {{is found in}} foodways, which {{includes}} everything involved in the procurement, preparation, serving and eating of daily meals at home. Most of us go home each evening for dinner, wake up for breakfast and pack up a lunch or snack pack to take <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day. All the assumptions about how this occurs, who does what when arise only when the established process (i.e. family custom) hits a snag: we've run out of milk or someone ate {{the last of the}} cookies. Maybe Dad is off on a trip and can't make the Sunday morning pancakes. Each of these food customs is understood and accepted by the group as a whole, and followed {{as a matter of course}} with little or no discussion.|$|E
2500|$|Lévesque {{had argued}} that the party should not make {{sovereignty}} {{the object of the}} 1985 election and instead opt for the [...] "Beau risque" [...] strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, [...] "that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Quebec's demands seriously and work <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greater good of Quebecers." [...] His new position weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were byelection defeats. Lévesque resigned as leader of the Parti Québécois on June 20, 1985, and as premier of Quebec on October 3, 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the 'Long March', Prestes {{subsequently}} {{wrote that}} [...] "the tactics of swift marches, evasion {{as far as}} possible of contact with superior enemy forces and surprise attacks aimed at demoralizing the enemy and capturing arms and ammunition, demonstrated that in Brazilian conditions it was possible to stage a protracted struggle". However, years later he was critical of the futility of his own strategy, writing that [...] "I also defended the column's march tactics, claiming that they presented opportunities for recruiting new fighters. This, however, was not the case. The farmers sympathised <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> simple reason that we were against the oppressors, they admired our heroism and devotion, but had no intention (with rare exceptions of some young people) of committing themselves to a struggle in whose success they could not believe".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; he is ill," [...] said Herbert. [...] "We {{have had}} a gentleman from London <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last few days--a friend of my father's. His name is Mr. Prendergast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down if you {{can find}} room, Terence," [...] Colonel Corcoran said. [...] "Wouldn't you like to be back <b>with</b> <b>us</b> again, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shindy that we are likely to have, tomorrow?" ...|$|R
60|$|Some 500 men {{and boys}} trotted curiously along <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> world as if the bus were a circus parade cage filled with striped tigers. What a rustic, motley crowd massed about in and on that ball ground. There must have been 10,000.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I {{am in the}} right," [...] the {{agitated}} man protested vigorously. [...] "For {{five years}} we have worked and with good result.

6000|$|... "Jump in, Hetty," [...] she said; [...] "I'm {{going to}} take you <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night. The day's fishing has tired you; there are deep circles under your eyes; and that stuffy old hotel isn't home-like. Jump in." ...|$|E
