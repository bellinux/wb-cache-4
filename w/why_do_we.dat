5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

25|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> in this feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles {{dedicated}} {{the month}} of February to the infernal gods, and as {{at the beginning of}} it Pluto stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted candles, so they, {{at the beginning of the}} month, walked about the city with lighted candles. Because the holy fathers could not extirpate the custom, they ordained that Christians should carry about candles in honor of the Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in the honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.|$|E

25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Storm of Zehirs {{use of the}} Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules {{with the}} exception of GameSpy, who expressed skepticism of the ruleset in a preview of the game. [...] The game's handling of character death was not well received, [...] despite being more faithful to the pencil and paper version than previous Dungeons & Dragons video games. [...] Unlike Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer where defeated characters would be automatically revived after a battle, Storm of Zehir requires a powerful spell or a [...] "Coin of Waukeen" [...] to resurrect dead allies. [...] Reviewers considered this requirement unforgiving; GameSpy said [...] "This merely forces the player to troop back to town through a zillion meaningless random encounters. This may be [...] "realistic" [...] (whatever that means in a world where players fight against newborn gods and sentient snakes), but it's simply not fun. Baldur's Gate had this all worked out over a decade ago. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> need to re-invent the wheel?" ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{cast member}} Dan Castellaneta {{occasionally}} voiced Santa's Little Helper for bit parts, American voice artist Frank Welker most often provided {{the sounds of}} the dog and other animals on the show from [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F", which aired on March 7, 1991, to [...] "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily", which aired on October 1, 1995. He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a [...] "sympathetic" [...] character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that [...] "he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy, and he's a pleasure to work with." [...] Groening has commented that he was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa's Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the [...] "questions and answers" [...] section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because [...] "The producers thought... 'Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> need to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let's just give the damn dog to Dan!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have to look at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

2500|$|Kant also {{credited}} David Hume with awakening {{him from}} dogmatic slumber (circa 1771). Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds.
