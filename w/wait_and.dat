However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the {{aftermath}} of the December26 battle. Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January2. His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand, and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times, and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> finish the battle the next day. Washington moved his army around Cornwallis's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day. That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter.|$|E

5|$|The Conservatives {{remained}} {{a minority in}} the House of Commons and {{the passage of the}} Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced Lord Chelmsford as Lord Chancellor with Lord Cairns, and brought in George Ward Hunt as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling to <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.|$|E
5|$|The Rectory, {{at the end}} of Church Lane, {{opposite}} the church hall, {{is believed to have been}} built in 1529 by Sir John Barry, rector 1524–46. It has since undergone substantial renovations, including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W.P. <b>Wait</b> <b>and</b> further alterations c.1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The clock tower has since been removed. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere, and Malet. It is Grade II* listed.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} coastguard {{used some}} of the fortifications as bases to combat smuggling. Calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in <b>wait</b> <b>and,</b> {{by the middle of}} the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there; Sandown Castle in Kent was also used by the coastguard for anti-smuggling operations. In the coming decades some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses; Portland was disarmed after the war and converted into a private house. Gravesend was superseded by the New Tavern Fort and demolished in 1844. Meanwhile, the ruins of Netley Castle were transformed into a Gothic-styled house from 1826 onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} a larger ferry on the Skarnsund service was also pressing. Cars often had to <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> if the ferry sailed with full capacity, {{there was no room}} for {{passengers}} to leave their vehicles. Work to procure a new ferry to replace Skarnsund started in 1981. This resulted in the acquisition of the second-hand ferry Mosvik from Bergen, with a capacity of 24 cars, which entered service starting 9 December 1982. Skarnsund was leased to Namsos Trafikkselskap. In 1982, tickets for a single trip on the Skarnsund Ferry were NOK5 for an adult and NOK14 for a car with driver. On the Ytterøy service, it was NOK7 and 25, respectively. Discounts were available, up to 33% for cars and 50% for trucks and buses.|$|E
5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E

5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
5|$|Although Theophilos's {{principal}} commanders, Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools Manuel, both advised for {{a surprise}} night attack, the Emperor sided with {{the opinion of the}} other officers and resolved to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> launch his attack on the next day. The Byzantine army attacked at dawn, and initially made good progress: they drove back one wing of the opposite army, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Arabs. Near noon, Theophilos resolved to reinforce the other wing, and detached 2,000 Byzantines and the Kurdish contingent to do so, abandoning his post and passing behind his own army's lines. At this point, however, Afshin launched his Turkish horse-archers in a ferocious counter-attack which stymied the Byzantine advance and allowed the Arab forces to regroup. The Byzantine troops then noticed the emperor's absence, and, thinking he had been killed, began to waver. This soon turned into a disorderly retreat; some men fled as far as Constantinople, bringing with them the rumour that the Emperor had been killed. Some units, however, were apparently able to retreat in good order and assemble at a place called Chiliokomon.|$|E
5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused to heed the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get more people to use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E
5|$|Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) {{is accused}} by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) of {{attempting}} to frame her for the murder. As Janine prepares to flee Walford, Peggy finds Roxy and Ronnie fighting. She tells the girls that she too was present the night Archie was killed, arriving to find him injured but alive, however left without calling for medical help. Outside, Bradley and Stacey are {{about to take a}} taxi to St Pancras railway station when Bradley realises he has forgotten their passports. He tells Stacey to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> hurries back home to collect them, but is spotted by the police. A chase ensues, and Bradley climbs onto the roof of The Queen Victoria public house in an attempt to escape. He shouts for Stacey to run before losing his footing and falling from the roof. He dies from his injuries as a distressed Stacey reaches him and the residents look on in horror. Stacey is comforted by Max, and confesses that she is the one who killed Archie.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued {{on a daily basis}} via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight <b>wait,</b> <b>and</b> the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|E
