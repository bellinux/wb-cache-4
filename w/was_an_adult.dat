5|$|Burial PNT-003 was interred at {{the same}} time as Burial PNT-002. The {{deceased}} <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was lying face down with a northwest-southeast orientation. The remains were very poorly preserved but the upper canines were both decorated with pyrite incrustations. The deceased was not accompanied by jewellery or funerary offerings.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the Virgin Islands dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes were collected on Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E
5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E

5|$|In 1776 the German {{zoologist}} Peter Simon Pallas formally {{described the}} bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck {{stated that the}} type specimen <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It has been questioned whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|One {{was adapted}} twice into {{original}} video animation (OVA) series.

The all ages OVA is {{loosely based on}} the original One visual novel and is drawn with a different setting. The second series, produced by Cherry Lips, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> OVA under the title One: True Stories. Three DVD volumes containing a single episode each were released between November 21, 2003 and May 28, 2004. One: True Stories was later licensed for English distribution by Media Blasters and the three episodes were released in a single volume on August 16, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
5|$|Tijori's thriller Fox {{starring}} Arjun Rampal and Sunny Deol {{was delayed}} due to production issues. Upon release in September 2009, the film received poor reviews. In {{the same year}} {{it was announced that}} Tijori would direct a Vikram Bhatt-produced film titled Bhaag Johny. The cast included Muzzamil Ibrahim and 2 new actresses. During the film's shooting, Ibrahim had to leave the film due to his differences with Tijori and subsequently the film was shelved for a brief period. The following year, Bhatt announced that he himself will direct the film, there would be a different lead actor and Tijori would play the role of a Pakistani policeman. Two years later it was reported that Tijori would direct Vikram Bhatt-produced film Love Games. His next directorial <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> suspense thriller titled Dare You, starring debutante Alisha Khan who was selected after an audition of more than 800 girls. The film's poster was {{the first of its kind}} and featured the lead actress showing her middle finger. However, Tijori left the project due to creative differences with the film's producers. In 2013, he directed the film Rock'In Love which featured Hanif Hilal and Sandeepa Dhar in lead role. Do Lafzon Ki Kahani starring Randeep Hooda is Tijori's next directorial project.|$|E

25|$|Burial 21 {{was found}} under the temple {{at the summit}} of Building C when archaeologists {{investigated}} a looters' tunnel. It dates to the Postclassic and <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male aged between 35 and 50 years of age, lying horizontally with an east-west orientation.

25|$|Bonaparte (1996) {{interpreted}} the relatively large orbital {{opening in the}} skull as a juvenile trait. Ronald Tykoski agreed (2005) and suggested that certain skull features of the type specimen suggested that it was young, specifically, the skull bones are not completely fused, relatively large orbits, and a short snout. Paul Sereno et al. (1993), supported the notion that Eoraptor <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> specimen based on the closure of sutures in the vertebral column, and the partial fusion of the scapulocoracoid.|$|E

25|$|Finally, doctors {{managed to}} save {{both mother and}} child. The baby, however, {{suffered}} damage at the brachial plexus, and the nerves in his arm were injured. As he grew, it failed to develop normally, {{and by the time}} he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> William's left arm was 15cm shorter than the right. There is also speculation that the difficult labour caused fetal distress, which deprived the future emperor of oxygen for eight to ten minutes and might have brought about other neurological problems.|$|E

His father, Edward Spurway, the local rector, died on 8 February 1914, and three elder brothers {{were killed in the}} First World War: two of these brothers, George Vyvan Spurway (1893-1918) and Richard Popham Spurway (1890-1915), attended Sherborne School and their names are recorded in the School's Book of Remembrance. His mother was left in difficult circumstances, bringing up her two youngest children; Spurway's surviving brother Francis Spurway <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> by this time.|$|E
25|$|Burial 17 were {{excavated}} from {{an artificial}} terrace in {{east of the}} centre of Topoxte island, immediately to the southeast of a residential complex. The burial contains the remains of three individuals. The first <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male over 30 years old, buried in a seated position {{with a couple of}} associated pieces of flint. The remains date to the Postclassic. The second individual was buried prone, oriented northwards, they have been tentatively identified as a male of unknown age. He was interred in the Late Classic with a ceramic vessel, a ceramic bowl and a ceramic disk. The third individual is represented only by a skull, which belonged to a child of between 2 and 5 years of age. The skull was associated with various Early Classic artifacts but it is unclear if it dates from the same period or was deposited during the Postclassic.|$|E

25|$|The next {{series of}} major archaeological {{excavations}} at Stanwick {{were carried out}} from 1981 to 1986 by a team from Durham University led by Percival Turnbull and Professor Colin Haselgrove. One of their most enigmatic finds <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> male burial {{at the rear of}} a rampart in the fortifications where a horse's head had been carefully placed upon the body. Turnbull and Haselgrove argued that Stanwick's huge outer circuit of ditches and banks had probably been built first, during the mid-first century AD, and then the inner area sub-divided. They maintained that the six mile (10km) fortification was too long to be easily defended and that its enormous size was intended instead to emphasise the power, prestige and wealth of its owner. They concluded that Stanwick had not been the fortress stronghold of Venutius but was rather the estate of his ex-wife, Queen Cartimandua, and possibly even the original tribal capital of the Brigantes.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{his initial}} {{confession}}, Riley, who <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> over 18 (aged 20) {{at the time}} of the crime, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing Jim and Naomi Olive and faced the death penalty. Under hypnosis, Riley later recanted the part of his initial confession about beating Naomi Olive with the hammer, saying that when he entered the house, he found Naomi Olive lying in bed, bleeding from head wounds and near death, with the hammer embedded in her head. Riley thus implied that Marlene Olive (who had been using the hammer that morning to repair a platform shoe) had fatally beaten her mother with the hammer before leaving the house. Riley contended that he had stabbed and suffocated Naomi Olive because she was suffering and near death from the hammer attack, and he was trying to end her misery. He said that he initially confessed to killing Naomi Olive in order to protect Marlene Olive by taking the blame for her actions. Riley admitted shooting Jim Olive, but said he acted out of fear and self-defense as Jim had threatened to kill him.|$|E
