Subsequently, in an essay appearing in The Intellectual Activist, Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on [...] "inherently dishonest ideas" [...] whose advocacy must never be sanctioned. He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to [...] "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," [...] but to a [...] "fundamental and philosophical" [...] cause: [...] "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If you fail fully to grasp and accept the concept, <b>whether</b> <b>your</b> failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." [...] Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: [...] "if {{you agree with the}} Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone.
