Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the tanker berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes. Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section of the pipeline.|$|E

5|$|In the Tokyo Woman's Christian College, {{commenced}} in 1924, Raymond's architecture {{can be seen}} {{to still}} be heavily influenced by Wright.

5|$|The Bill {{is unique}} amongst police dramas {{in that it}} takes a serial format, {{focussing}} on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police <b>work.</b> <b>Also</b> unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.|$|E
5|$|The first paper, {{written with}} Jordan and Kundt, is a {{treatise}} {{on how to}} characterize exact solutions to Einstein's field equations in a systematic way. The analysis presented there uses tools from differential geometry such as the Petrov classification of Weyl tensors (that is, {{those parts of the}} Riemann tensor describing the curvature of space-time that are not constrained by Einstein's equations), isometry groups and conformal transformations. This <b>work</b> <b>also</b> includes the first definition and classification of pp-waves, a class of simple gravitational waves.|$|E
5|$|The series {{refers to}} a set of works by Henri Matisse, with this work {{specifically}} referring to L'Atelier Rouge. The work incorporates several other Lichtenstein's works and gets its name from the large portion of Lichtenstein's Look Mickey that is included. Lichtenstein used a much more realistic representation of his own works than is standard for most artists. Elements of the <b>work</b> <b>also</b> refer to works from both Fernand Léger and Matisse.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} four known snowscapes by Renoir: Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868); Winter Landscape (1868); Snowy Landscape (1870–75); and another <b>work</b> <b>also</b> titled Snowy Landscape (1875). Along with Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne, Renoir {{would return to the}} imagery of the Bois de Boulogne years later with a large {{painting}} called The Morning Ride (1873), alternatively titled Madame Henriette Darras, which was rejected by the Salon in that year.|$|E
5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The <b>work</b> <b>also</b> represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. <b>Work</b> <b>also</b> {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E
