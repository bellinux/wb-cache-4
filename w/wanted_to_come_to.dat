From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and {{kept in touch with}} the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation.

25|$|Ormonde {{was faced}} with a {{difficult}} task in reconciling all the different factions in Ireland. The Old (native) Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent ("Old English") were represented in Confederate Irelandessentially an independent Catholic government based in Kilkennywho <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with King Charles I of England in return for religious toleration and self-government. On the other side, any concession that Ormonde made to the Confederates weakened his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland. Ormonde's negotiations with the Confederates were therefore tortuous, even though many of the Confederate leaders were his relatives or friends.|$|E

500|$|American author Jennifer Roberson {{was known}} for writing fantasy novels before she moved into {{historical}} fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, [...] "One thing I'd always wanted to try–another ‘someday’ dream– was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic." [...] She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend {{from the perspective of}} Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a [...] "recounting" [...] of the original story, because [...] "there is none"; rather, Lady of the Forest was [...] "purely [...] own concoction." [...] Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, [...] "I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, the key was logic—I interwove historical fact with the fantasy of the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some women became picture brides in {{an attempt}} to escape {{familial}} duties. They thought that by leaving Japan or Korea they could get out of responsibilities such as filial piety that came along with traditional marriage. Some women thought that they would gain freedoms denied to them in Japan and Korea. A quote from a Korean picture bride named Mrs. K embodies the mindset of many picture brides traveling to Hawaii, [...] "Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like talk, you can talk, if you like work, you can work." [...] With the influx of women becoming picture brides, some women followed the trend as the thing to do.

Haider used her voice skilfully in some of his earlier films such as Khazanchi (1941) and Khandan (1942). By 1940, Begum was already well established on radio. The songs [...] "Cheechi Wich Pa ke Chhalla", [...] "Mera Haal Vekh Ke" [...] and [...] "Kankaan Diyaan Faslaan" [...] from Yamla Jatt of 1940 became a huge hit and popularised Pran, singer Begum and composer Haider. Haider continued to compose hit songs which Begum sang for films including Zamindar, Poonji and Shama. Director Mehboob Khan used Begum's voice in Taqdeer (1943), where he introduced Nargis as the heroine. Begum was soon singing for other composers including Rafiq Ghaznavi, Ameer Ali, Pt Gobindram, Pt Amarnath, Bulo C. Rani, Rashid Atre and M. A. Mukhtar, in the pre-independence era.|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 1959, Shunryu Suzuki (then age 55) {{came from}} Japan to San Francisco {{to serve as}} head priest of Sokoji—a Soto Zen temple then located at 1881 Bush Street in Japantown. He was joined by his wife Mitsu (also from Japan) in 1961. Sokoji—founded by Hosen Isobe in 1934—had been housed in a former Jewish synagogue that is now Kokoro Assisted Living. Upon Suzuki’s arrival at Sokoji, the {{congregation}} was composed entirely {{of members of the}} Japanese-American population. Unlike his predecessors, Suzuki was a fluent speaker of English who actually <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the United States. Suzuki's arrival came {{at the tail end of}} the Beat movement and just prior to the social movements of the 1960s, both of which had major roots in San Francisco. Before long, Sokoji had non-Japanese Americans — mostly beatniks— coming to the temple to sit zazen with him in the morning. Soon these Westerners participated in regular services, and new non-Asian students came to outnumber the Japanese-American congregation. This change in demography caused a rift in the Sokoji community. [...] The tension was alleviated when Suzuki’s Western students began gathering for separate services, albeit still at Sokoji, in 1961. Some of these students began calling their group City Center, and they incorporated in 1962 as the San Francisco Zen Center.|$|E
2500|$|... 1849 saw an {{emigration}} of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, {{by way of}} Trinidad {{and other}} locations in the West Indies. Most of them settled in Illinois with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s the Reverend Robert Reid Kalley, from Scotland, a Presbyterian minister {{as well as a}} physician, made a stop at Funchal, Madeira {{on his way to a}} mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness. The Rev. Kalley and his wife stayed on Madeira where he began preaching the Protestant gospel and converting islanders from Catholicism. Eventually, the Rev. Kalley was arrested for his religious conversion activities and imprisoned. Another missionary from Scotland, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira. By 1846, about 1,000 Protestant Madeirenses, who were discriminated against and the subjects of mob violence because of their religious conversions, chose to immigrate to Trinidad and other locations in the West Indies in answer for a call for sugar plantation workers. The Madeirenses exiles did not fare well in the West Indies. The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent the Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with the Rev. Arsenio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the United States. The Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, the Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to be settled in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society. Accounts state that anywhere from 700 to 1,000 exiles came to the United States at this time.|$|E
