5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E

50|$|From {{the onset}} of the (Metternich) Restoration in Germany, Heine was no longer secure from the censorship, and in 1831 he finally {{migrated}} to France as an exile.

5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of feminism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E

5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, Either/Or received {{new life}} as a grand philosophical work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981), where MacIntyre situates Either/Or {{as an attempt to}} capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. After Virtue renewed Either/Or as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E
50|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{developed in}} the 1870s. There were three main independent schools.

Its main representatives were Stanley Jevons, Alfred Marshall, and Arthur Pigou. The Austrian School of Economics {{was made up of}} Austrian economists Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, and Friedrich von Wieser, who developed the theory of capital and tried to explain economic crises. It was founded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1871 <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> Menger's Principles of Economics. The Lausanne School, led by Léon Walras and Vilfredo Pareto, developed the theories of general equilibrium and Pareto efficiency.

50|$|The {{beginning}} of the Questione Ladina is marked by <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saggi ladini by Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829-1907), who identified the area between the Oberalp Pass and the Gulf of Trieste as a specific language area, with some common characteristics, and called the idioms spoken there Ladin dialects.
