40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} is a {{very useful}} general technique for exploiting the preference patterns {{of a group of}} users to predict the utility of items to a particular user. Previous research has studied several probabilistic graphic models for collaborative filtering with promising results. However, while these models have succeeded in capturing the similarity among users and items in one way or the other, none of them has considered the fact that users with similar interests in items can have very different rating patterns; some users tend to assign a higher rating to all items than other users. In this paper, we propose and study of two new graphic models that address the distinction between user preferences and ratings. In one model, called the decoupled model, we introduce two different variables to decouple a users preferences FROM his ratings. IN the other, called the preference model, we model the orderings OF items preferred BY a USER, rather than the USERs numerical ratings of items. Empirical study over two datasets of movie ratings shows that appropriate modeling of the distinction between user preferences and ratings improves the performance substantially and consistently. Specifically, the proposed decoupled model outperforms all five existing approaches that we compare with significantly, but the preference model is not very successful. These results suggest that explicit modeling of the underlying user preferences is very important for collaborative filtering, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> ignoring the rating information completely.

40|$|Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge (HSNWR) on Florida’s {{east coast}} {{provides}} undisturbed nesting habitat for three species of threatened or endangered marine turtles. Predation by raccoons and armadillos poses {{the greatest risk}} to turtle nests, and predator control {{has been identified as}} the most important management tool for enhancing nesting productivity. Recently, {{estimates of the number of}} nests that would have been lost in the 2000 nesting and incubation season were made using the results from four control approaches. These approaches were, in order of descending complexity: (1) refuge control enhanced by a one person-month contract with federal control specialists, with that control optimized using a passive tracking methodology for monitoring predators; (2) refuge control enhanced by a one person-month contract with federal control specialists, without predator monitoring; (3) refuge control, but no contract with specialists; (4) no control. In that analysis, approach 1 resulted in the fewest turtles lost to predation. In this paper, we perform a benefit-/cost analysis to determine if operational efficacy translates into economic efficiency. Approach 1 had by far the best benefit-cost ratio for loggerhead turtles, but approach 2 was best for Atlantic green and leatherback turtles. However, almost 90 % of the turtles nesting at HSNWR are loggerhead, and this area is vital to loggerhead survival. Thus, approach 1 also had by far the best benefit-cost ratio over all turtle species, saving approximately $ 1. 7 million over approach 2, $ 2. 6 million over approach 3 and $ 8. 4 million over approach 4. Given these results, one must ask how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>afford</b> <b>not</b> to control predators, and furthermore, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> to take the minimal extra steps to maximize control efficacy. 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.

Putting aside any moral objections to this, country athletes have made {{a significant contribution to}} Australia’s sporting heritage and as such <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> under service this talent pool. This paper presents a case study that describes how the Northern Inland Academy of Sport (NIAS) has provided sport physiotherapy, psychology, and nutrition to young athletes living through the north-west region of New South Wales (NSW) via the Regional Athlete Coach Education (RACE) program. The case study displays how the NIAS sport science and sport medicine program has evolved over the past seven years. That is, from being delivered on a sport-by-sport basis following the New South Wales Institute of Sport (NSWIS) model for Tier- 3 sports, to employing a town-by-town service delivery system. Part of the innovation of the NIAS RACE program is providing sport physiotherapy, psychology, and nutrition education in local towns throughout north-west NSW. However another part involves inviting NIAS athletes and their families, coaches and friends {{to be part of this}} training. This is the service delivery component. But RACE also involves conceptual and technical innovations that present sport science and sport medicine as local, relevant and as accessible to young athletes in Tenterfield, Moree, and Gunnedah as their counterparts in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. The practical implication of this paper is to display that delivering sport science and sport medicine services to regional, rural and remote athletes needn’t be expensive but it does need to be innovative. ...|$|E

40|$|There can {{be little}} {{question}} that {{we are living in}} a drug oriented society. The attendant problems of abuse are as widespread as the substances themselves, from the pill infested medicine chest to the ten year old Heroin addict. In the past several years not only the number of substances being abused, but also the number of people abusing substances, has increased dramatically. Law enforcement agencies and officials at all levels of government are continuing to significantly increase efforts to control the illicit supply of substances subject to abuse. Frequently these efforts can be key ingredients to successful community efforts. curtailment of supply often pressures the user towards rehabilitation and treatment programs, while removing the easy opportunity to experiment for many others [...] which gives our educational efforts time to be effective. In the past several years various modalities of educational and preventative efforts have been undertaken with varying degrees of success. While it is true that anyone playing with these substances should be scared, it is also apparent that fear alone is not sufficient {{to prevent the spread of}} Drug Abuse. It is also obvious that facts alone are not sufficient·, witness the anomaly of cigarette smokers sitting down to read the Surgeon General's report on how they are slowly killing themselves. Educational programs, utilizing special programs, assemblies, films and speakers all help, but they also are not sufficient. There just is no one easy answer, no instant solution. The problems of Drug Abuse are complex, often being referred to as Socio-Medical in nature. Most problems, complex or otherwise, are solved one step at a time. In this very limited sense the problems are similar to those faced by society in the past. There are more differences than similarities, and our response to the problems must take those differences into account if we hope to be successful. There is a clear and definite need for action. The addict must be treated, the experimenter or non user educated, and the seller prosecuted. In response to these needs and the fact that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> unnecessary duplication, the Drug Abuse Authority has been created. It is essential that long range planning include well thought out comprehensive plans which effectively utilize local resources in such a manner as to insure continued viability of programs. It is our hope that these materials will serve as a guide to interested and involved citizens in establishing programs designed to meet the specific needs of their community. Specific information with regard to some local individuals to be contacted if you are now, or intend to be, involved in the field of drug abuse programming in Iowa, is listed in the appendices. These people are invaluable local resources that no one is in a position to ignore. There no city, no town and no family that is safe from the creeping cancer of Drug Abuse and we must communicate concerning problems and new ideas among ourselves if we are to have any chance of success...|$|R
40|$|Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{acquired}} mental retardation in the United States and worldwide. The fetal brain is highly susceptible to the teratogenic effects of alcohol from maternal consumption during pregnancy resulting in newborns with mental deficits and congenital malformations. FAS diagnosis is difficult to diagnose in newborns where distinct anatomical defects are not apparent from mothers of moderate to light alcohol use. Hence, medical diagnoses are often not ascertained until mid-childhood after irreparable brain damage has already occurred. Such infants will have been deprived of available socioclinical interventions, trainings, measures, and future treatments that may someday be implemented soon after birth.

40|$|Just {{like the}} blind {{men in the}} popular story of perceiving the elephant, the three major {{constituencies}} participating in the energy debate have greatly different perceptions of the problem. The constituency that is worried about climate change believes the energy problem is caused by profligate use of fossil fuel that has dramatically changed our atmosphere. The energy security group sees dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil increasingly held by countries hostile to the US. The economic vitality group sees high energy prices and their effect {{on the economy and}} our life-style. Just like the blind men, each of the three constituencies perceives a different problem. And just as with the blind men, while each perspective is right as a piece of the elephant, it takes all the perspectives together to actually solve the problem. Environmentalists focus on solutions responding to the scientific consensus that greenhouse gases are creating rapid climate change. The tipping point has come: it is now a consensus position among scientists the global warming is being affected by anthropogenic activity to 90 % certainty according to the last IPCC report. Although they still struggle with the prediction of how much global temperatures will rise if we do nothing [...] is it 5 deg or 10 under BAU? This group believes that we cannot afford to take a chance because we get only one chance. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> do this kind of experiment with the Earth. Any choice which decreases our CO{sub 2 } footprint is favored, even if it means a decrease in standard of living. The energy security constituency sees the geo-politics of oil becoming increasingly dire. They look at oil money being used to fund anti-American activities of groups such as the Wahabis in Saudi Arabia, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the infamous Al Qaeda. They quip that the Iraq war is the first war where we are paying for both sides. They note Iran and the Shia throughout the Middle East seeing the possibility of controlling 2 / 3 of the world's oil. They see oil and gas being used by Russia to exert political power using the gas tap and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela clearly anti-American and now a virtual dictator who controls 15 % of our oil imports. Conflicts in Nigeria over oil wealth and corruption affected our oil supply. Countries such as China are at best unwilling to join political action against countries such as Sudan that supply them oil, and at worst, selling them arms in order to cement their relationships with respect to importing oil. This security constituency favors ending our vulnerability by ending our ''addiction to foreign oil''. This group thinks that there is no domestic source of energy that is bad. They will be happy to see our corn turned into ethanol; our coal turned into liquid fuel for transportation. No matter that the price of tortillas doubles in Mexico, we expand corn farming {{at the expense of the}} environment, our tanks and pipes in gas stations corrode and leak, or we make liquid fuel from coal, thus increasing the carbon footprint by 30 % per unit of energy. The economic vitality group sees increasing international demand for oil occurring simultaneously with a peaking supply of light sweet crude. They see an oil market where higher prices drive more production of oil which is heavier and more sour (supply follows demand). However, fast growth in world-wide demand increases even faster and prices will go up. For example, China adds 10, 000 cars per month, and there is an uncanny correlation between the price of oil and the amount of oil imported by China. The security contingent also worries about reliability of supply as affected by pipeline leaks in Alaska or hurricanes or potential terrorism. This constituency thinks the problem is one of capacity and favors solutions that will increase oil production, reservoirs, pipelines and refineries. They believe that the energy system will be determined by the market and want solutions that favor investment in capacity. What the environmentalists don't seem to get is climate change by itself will fail to gather broad enough support to achieve the environmentalists goals. People will not likely choose to shiver in the dark for a climate problem which is intangible to them. Where environmentalists have been successful they have built coalitions with other constituencies. As an example, the renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS) in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas etc. are supported by people who want to lower emissions to protect air quality, or protect the state from energy supply crises or promote economic development within the boundaries of the state. The adoption of an RPS addresses a coalition of interests. In Nevada, there was an effort to change the RPS to a low-carbon portfolio standard. The effort failed because those who were interested in economic development or energy security in the state saw no benefit...|$|E
