5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot <b>would</b> <b>first</b> puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he <b>would</b> <b>first</b> toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they <b>would</b> <b>first</b> reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E
5|$|HTC officially {{announced}} the Dream on 23 September 2008. It <b>would</b> <b>first</b> be released by T-Mobile as the T-Mobile G1, {{starting in the}} United States on 20 October 2008 in its 3G-enabled markets only (it became available in all markets on 24 January 2009), followed by a British release in November 2008, and a release in other European territories in early 2009. On 10 March 2009, it became available in Poland as the Era G1 on Era. On 2 June 2009, both the Dream and its successor (the HTC Magic) were released by Rogers Wireless in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity {{at a much lower}} cost, but voters <b>would</b> <b>first</b> have to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E

The red player <b>would</b> have the <b>first</b> spin in round 1, the yellow player <b>would</b> have the <b>first</b> spin in round 2 and the blue/green player <b>would</b> have the <b>first</b> spin in round 3. From 1999 to 2003 when the format consisted of 4 rounds plus the major prize round, the red player <b>would</b> take the <b>first</b> spin in round 4.|$|R
5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, he <b>would</b> <b>first</b> compose on a {{synthesizer}} before {{working with}} programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach <b>would</b> <b>first</b> {{make a note}} of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in a}} notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a codified system.|$|E
5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations {{in a manner}} that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression <b>would</b> <b>first</b> evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E

5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films <b>would</b> <b>first</b> reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while others are not, supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation. This is further evidenced by a tentative reading {{which is consistent with}} known astronomy. In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north to the right of Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they <b>would</b> <b>first</b> see Arcturus on the horizon, and then Polaris. The arrangement of glyphs in this example, and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and Polaris, are consistent with these facts.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of the}} {{governor}} of Bust, Maymandi was raised as the foster brother of the Ghaznavid prince Mahmud, and <b>would</b> <b>first</b> start his administrative career {{as the head of}} the department of correspondence of Khorasan. He would thereafter rapidly rise to higher offices, finally becoming the vizier of the Ghaznavid dynasty in 1013, which would last until 1024, when he was arrested due to the great amount of wealth that he had gained, which the suspicious Mahmud disliked.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps <b>would</b> <b>first</b> attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from reinforcing the Koreans. The 120th Division would then fight its way across the Ch'ongch'on River and tie down the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E
5|$|As {{the popular}} choice {{leading into the}} election, he handily {{defeated}} fellow councillor Arthur Cushing by a count of 627 votes to 355, and thus became mayor of Edmonton. He served in this capacity for one term of one year, but did not seek re-election in 1906 and retired from political life thereafter. It was during May's term as mayor in which the municipal foundations of Edmonton were set; he oversaw {{the purchase of the}} road maintenance equipment, the city's first telephone system as well as the upgrade of the street car system to steel rails and posts, purchase of land for municipal use, paving of roads, and negotiations {{for the establishment of a}} manufacturing plant in the city. He also travelled to Toronto to lobby for a new union railway station in Edmonton to be constructed for use by the Grand Trunk, Canadian Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways. It was also during May's term which the Alberta Legislature Building <b>would</b> <b>first</b> open its doors, which he would participate in its opening ceremonies. In 1911, he would be named a returning officer for Edmonton, in charge of overseeing the Canadian federal election, 1911.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud Line on the north side and the Furuset Line {{on the south side of}} Groruddalen and the Lambertseter Line on the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly need a good public transport system; suburban lines <b>would</b> <b>first</b> be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student <b>would</b> <b>first</b> study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who <b>would</b> <b>first</b> explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E

Rival soap opera, EastEnders, had produced a similar storyline when Shabnam Masood and Kush Kazemi (Rakhee Thakrar and Davood Ghadami) lost their son Zaair before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned {{months prior to the}} announcement of EastEnders storyline. It was revealed Mercedes <b>would</b> <b>first</b> admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.|$|E
