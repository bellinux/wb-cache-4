50|$|Emily persuaded Tinhead {{to hold a}} {{party at}} the Johnson house while Mick was away, and {{although}} this seemed a good idea, things turned nasty after Sotto and Weller (two of Tinhead's ex-cell mates) turned up. Sotto tried to hit on Emily but she purposely poured her drink all over him. Tinhead, hearing the argument ordered Sotto to leave but Sotto decided to get his own back by inviting loads of his friends to No. 5 where they held their own party with music blasting out from the car stereo which upset a lot of the neighbors, especially Ron Dixon and Jimmy Corkhill. Jimmy stole the car and drove off out of the close to stop the music playing out loud. After the music had stopped, Sotto guessed that Tinhead had grassed him up. Whilst attacking Tinhead, Emily told Sotto that if he doesn't leave, Tinhead will have him beaten up again like he did in prison. In an act of revenge, Sotto and his mate smashed Mick's <b>wide</b> <b>screen</b> <b>TV.</b>|$|R

Business would condemn the Rudd government’s new industrial relations body as {{a throwback to the}} bad old days of the 1907 Harvester judgement, when Justice Higgins ignored the economic arguments and set the basic wage at the level needed to support a man, his wife and three children. There is no prospect that Fair Work Australia will be so bold as to revive the spirit of the Harvester judgement. Yet the superannuation industry constantly demands that governments should dictate that all retirees must have enough income to buy a desired basket of goods {{in much the same way}} as Higgins did with the basic wage. The main difference is that the super industry’s basket goes well beyond Higgins’ notion of “frugal comfort. ” [...] . Read the full article on Inside Story >...|$|R

Imaging by the lens {{system in a}} special schlieren-optical arrangement of a color <b>TV</b> <b>projector</b> is simulated by spatial frequency filtering. A sinus modulation of carrier gratings is written into the control layer of a single light valve. The dark field image of this phase object is considered {{as an example of}} signals to be transmitted. A modification of the power spectrum of the object intensity is proposed to estimate the influence of an optical arrangement to be designed for a high-definition <b>TV</b> <b>projector.</b> Test functions in the spatial frequency plane shaped to an experimental MTF curve are used for calculations. The demands on the projection lenses are found to be independent of the chosen carrier gratings. The effect of wave aberration on signal transmittance is outlined...|$|R
